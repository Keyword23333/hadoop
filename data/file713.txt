7130006 i need to take a nap for a few hours
7130007 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7130008 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7130009 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7130010 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7130011 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7130012 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7130013 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7130014 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7130015 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7130016 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7130017 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7130018 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7130019 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7130020 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7130021 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7130022 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7130023 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7130059 la privaci n de libertad de sr halil savda durante los per odos entre el 16 y 28 de diciembre de 2004 entre el 7 de diciembre de 2006 y el 2 de febrero de 2007 as como entre el 5 de febrero y el 28 de julio de 2007 era arbitrario su privaci n de libertad desde el 27 de marzo de 2008 es tambi n arbitraria contraviniendo los art culos 9 y 18 de la declaraci n universal de derechos humanos y con los art culos 9 y 18 del convenio internacional sobre derechos civiles y pol ticos
7130060 las segundas y subsecuentes privaciones de libertad de matan kaminer adam maor noam bahat y jonathan ben artzi son contrarias al art culo 14 p rrafo 7 del pacto internacional sobre derechos civiles y pol ticos el incumplimiento de las normas internacionales relacionadas con el derecho a un juicio justo es de tanta gravedad como conferir a la privaci n de libertad una naturaleza arbitraria
7130061 este proyecto de ley debe ser discutido en el majlis milli el parlamento azer si algunos diputados insisten en aprobar este proyecto de ley algunas condiciones ser n establecidas para ello es decir el servicio militar alternativo no ser establecido en azerbay n a menos que las tierras ocupadas de azerbay n sean liberadas
7130062 si servir en las fuerzas armadas contradice las convicciones de una persona el servicio militar activo puede ser substituido por un servicio alternativo hecho en los casos especificados por la ley
7130063 hay motivos razonables a este respecto aproximadamente el 20 de las tierras azerbaiyanas han sido ocupadas no hay ninguna necesidad de aprobar este proyecto de la ley que crea condiciones para desviarse del servicio militar
7130064 la ley sobre el servicio civil alternativo deber a ser adoptada sin m s tardanza de acuerdo con el compromiso de acceso de azerbay n
7130065 acabar con el servicio militar obligatorio nos permitir tener profesionales totalmente entrenados profesionales que entienden su deber y el equipo que utilizan

7130070 que abandone este cuerpo femenino y renazca como var n
7130071 no permit an a ninguna mujer tocar las pertenencias de un lama ni pod a erigir una pared o la pared se caer una viuda era despreciable y era una diabla no permit an a las mujeres tocar el hierro ni usar instrumentos de hierro la religi n les imped a levantar sus ojos m s all de la rodilla de un hombre de la misma manera que los siervos y esclavos no pod an levantar los ojos al nivel de la cara de la nobleza o los grandes lamas
7130072 solo 626 personas pose an el 93 de las tierras y de la riqueza nacional y el 70 de los yakes en tibet entre ellos estaban los 333 cabezas de monasterios y autoridades religiosas y las 287 autoridades seculares contando la nobleza del ej rcito y seis ministros del gabinete
7130073 las fincas eran muy lucrativas un antiguo arist crata dijo que una peque a finca t pica ten a miles de ovejas mil yakes un n mero no determinado de n madas y 200 siervos agr colas la producci n anual constaba de m s de 36 000 kg de cereales m s de 1800 kg de lana y casi 500 kg de mantequilla los funcionarios del gobierno ten an poderes sin l mite de exacci n y pod an acumular una fortuna con sobornos para no meter a la c rcel o multar adem s pod an extraer dinero de los campesinos m s all de los impuestos oficiales

7130076 eso ya es bueno nunca vi a uno de ellos darle comida a un lama pobre que ten a hambre a los laicos creyentes los trataban igual o peor

7130079 las creencias budistas no permiten matar pero si golpeaban a alguien a punto de matarlo y luego lo soltaban para que muriera en otra parte pod an decir que su muerte fue en acto de dios otros m todos salvajes de castigo eran cortar las manos sacar los ojos con fierros calientes colgar de los pulgares lisiar meter en un saco y tirar al r o
7130080 se dice que el sabio le explic que la brecha entre los ricos y los pobres no se puede cerrar a la fuerza porque las condiciones de la vida actual son siempre las consecuencias de las acciones de la vida anterior y por lo tanto no es posible cambiar el curso de la vida por la fuerza de la voluntad
7130081 desde un punto de vista puramente secular esta doctrina debe considerarse una de las formas m s ingeniosas y nocivas de control social que se haya inventado para el tibetano com n y corriente aceptar esa doctrina significaba aceptar la idea de que es imposible cambiar su destino si uno nac a esclavo seg n la doctrina del karma no era culpa del esclavista sino su propia culpa por haber cometido delitos en una vida anterior a su vez la vida privilegiada del esclavista era la recompensa que este recib a por lo que hizo en una vida anterior as pues el que intentara romper las cadenas de su presi n se condenaba a s mismo a una vida futura peor de la que ya padec a evidentemente no son ideas que llevan a la revoluci n
7130082 sucede con frecuencia que objetivamente las masas necesitan un cambio determinado pero que subjetivamente no tienen todav a conciencia de esa necesidad y no est n dispuestas o decididas a realizarlo en tales circunstancias debemos esperar con paciencia no debemos realizar el cambio hasta que por efecto de nuestro trabajo la mayor parte de las masas haya adquirido conciencia de la necesidad de ese cambio y tenga el deseo y la decisi n de hacerlo de otro modo nos aislaremos de las masas todo trabajo que requiera la participaci n de las masas resultar ser una mera formalidad y terminar en el fracaso si las masas no est n conscientes de la necesidad de ese trabajo ni se muestran dispuestas a participar en l
7130083 la postergaci n no nos causar mucho da o sino que por el contrario puede traernos ventajas all ellos la clase dominante lama sta con sus fechor as e injusticia contra el pueblo nosotros a nuestro turno nos dedicamos a hacer cosas buenas tales como la producci n el comercio la construcci n de caminos el servicio m dico y el trabajo de frente nico uni n con la mayor a y educaci n paciente con el objeto de ganarnos a las masas
7130084 los jan trabajaban hombro a hombro con nosotros no nos azotaban por primera vez me trataban como un ser humano

7130086 en las llanuras la gran revoluci n socialista ha sido una lucha de clases muy violenta
7130087 en la historia de la humanidad toda fuerza reaccionaria que est a punto de perecer se lanza invariablemente a una ltima y desesperada embestida contra las fuerzas revolucionarias

7130090 el sol del kashag brillaba nicamente para los tres amos y los matones de los terratenientes pero el sol del partido comunista y el presidente mao brilla para nosotros los pobres
7130091 hacer la revoluci n no es ofrecer un banquete una revoluci n es una insurrecci n es un acto de violencia mediante el cual una clase derroca a otra sin recurrir a la m xima fuerza el campesinado jam s lograr a derrocar el poder de los terratenientes profundamente arraigado a trav s de los milenios
7130092 en algunos lugares vienen acusando una grave anormalidad las relaciones entre las nacionalidades tal situaci n es intolerable para los comunistas es indispensable criticar a fondo las ideas chovinistas de gran jan que se manifiestan de modo grave entre muchos militantes y cuadros de nuestro partido ideas reaccionarias de la clase terrateniente y la burgues a reflejadas en las relaciones entre las nacionalidades en otras palabras las ideas burguesas dominan en la mente de una parte de los camaradas y del pueblo que no ha recibido una educaci n marxista ni asimilado la pol tica del comit central sobre la cuesti n nacional
7130093 ponemos el acento en el combate al chovinismo de gran jan hay que combatir tambi n el nacionalismo local pero este por lo com n no es el blanco principal en el pasado los gobernantes reaccionarios sobre todo los de la nacionalidad jan levantaron toda clase de barreras entre las diversas nacionalidades y atropellaron a las minor as nacionales las consecuencias de todo esto no son f ciles de liquidar en corto tiempo ni siquiera dentro del pueblo trabajador el aire del espacio los bosques de la tierra y las riquezas del subsuelo son todos importantes elementos indispensables para la construcci n del socialismo pero ning n factor material puede ser explotado y aprovechado sino por el factor hombre debemos trabajar porque haya buenas relaciones entre la nacionalidad jan y las minor as nacionales y consolidar la unidad entre ellas para edificar nuestra gran patria socialista con los esfuerzos de todos

7130105 i submitted the fee 250 a cover letter a copy of the restaurants menu a fun amalgamation of somewhat bumbling nouvelle italian recipes and a wine list the main wine list that i submitted was a perfectly decent selection from around italy that met the magazines basic criteria about 250 wines including whites reds and sparkling wines some of which scored well in ws however osteria lintrepidos high priced reserve wine list was largely chosen from among some of the lowest scoring italian wines in wine spectator over the past few decades
7130106 getting the award however isnt exactly like winning an olympic medal this year nearly 4 500 restaurants spent 250 each to apply or reapply for the wine spectator award and all but 319 won the award of excellence or some greater kudos that translates to more than 1 million in revenue

7130108 its essentially impossible to tell a story to an entire population and have it resonate with all of them the global warming story for example has influenced some people a great deal and been dismissed out of hand by others while most marketers spend their time telling stories about themselves politicians spend a lot of time telling negative stories about the competition its illuminating because it makes the resonance idea really clear
7130109 choose your story or the competitions story wisely because you have to live with it for a long time and if its not authentic if it doesnt hold up youre left with nothing

7130150 the vets actually told me at first that he only had three months to live and that there was nothing i could do about it and i remember feeling just unbelievably helpless
7130151 even though the money goes to help the dogs heal really its the owners because i know how it feels to sort of have to sit there and feel helpless while watching them wither away and just giving them the ability to know that theyre fighting it with their dog makes them feel better
7130152 getting from the pacific to the atlantic its a lovely challenge and im really looking forward to stepping my toe in the atlantic when i get there but for me everything is about will it have been worthwhile is have we helped the dogs that were trying to do have we raised the money that we need to really make a difference for them

7130179 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7130180 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7130181 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7130182 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7130183 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7130184 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7130185 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7130186 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7130187 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7130188 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7130189 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7130190 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7130191 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7130192 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7130193 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7130194 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7130195 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7130196 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7130197 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7130198 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7130199 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7130200 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7130201 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7130202 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7130203 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7130204 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7130205 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7130206 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7130207 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7130208 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7130209 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7130210 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7130211 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7130212 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7130213 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7130214 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7130215 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7130216 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7130217 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7130218 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7130219 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7130220 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7130221 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7130222 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7130223 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7130224 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7130225 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7130226 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7130227 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7130228 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7130229 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7130230 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7130231 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7130232 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7130233 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7130234 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7130235 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7130236 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7130237 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7130238 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7130239 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7130240 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7130241 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7130242 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7130243 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7130244 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7130245 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7130246 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7130247 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7130248 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7130249 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7130250 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7130251 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7130252 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7130253 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7130254 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7130255 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7130256 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7130257 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7130258 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7130259 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7130260 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7130261 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7130262 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7130263 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7130264 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7130265 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7130266 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7130267 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7130268 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7130269 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7130270 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7130271 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7130272 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7130273 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7130274 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7130275 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7130276 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7130277 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7130278 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7130279 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7130280 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7130281 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7130282 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7130283 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7130284 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7130285 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7130286 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7130287 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7130288 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7130289 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7130290 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7130291 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7130292 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7130293 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7130294 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7130295 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7130296 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7130297 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7130298 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7130299 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7130300 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7130301 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7130302 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7130303 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7130304 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7130305 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7130306 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7130307 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7130308 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7130309 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7130310 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7130311 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7130312 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7130313 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7130314 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7130315 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7130316 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7130317 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7130318 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7130319 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7130320 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7130321 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7130322 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7130323 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7130324 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7130325 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7130326 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7130327 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7130328 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7130329 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7130330 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7130331 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7130332 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7130333 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7130334 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7130335 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7130336 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7130337 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7130338 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7130339 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7130340 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7130341 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7130342 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7130343 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7130344 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7130345 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7130346 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7130347 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7130348 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7130349 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7130350 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7130351 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7130352 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7130353 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7130354 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7130355 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7130356 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7130357 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7130358 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7130359 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7130360 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7130361 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7130362 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7130363 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7130364 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7130365 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7130366 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7130367 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7130368 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7130369 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7130370 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7130371 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7130372 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7130373 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7130374 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7130375 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7130376 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7130377 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7130378 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7130379 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7130380 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7130381 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7130382 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7130383 dont hate me because im beautiful hate me because im beautiful smart and rich
7130384 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7130385 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7130386 if you do not immunise a baby in this situation youre putting that babys life at risk
7130387 about a third of those chronic carriers will die young from cancer of the liver or cirrhosis of the liver this is a horrible disease
7130388 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7130389 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7130390 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7130391 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7130392 never give up until the project is buried so they can dance on its grave
7130393 gunns is in trouble they are looking for a foreign venture partner
7130394 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7130395 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7130396 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7130397 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7130398 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7130399 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7130400 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7130401 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7130402 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7130403 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7130404 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7130405 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7130406 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7130407 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7130408 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

7130455 over the course of the next few minutes the vehicle is seen a number of times in the neighbourhood by a number of police members and there are some attempts made to stop the vehicle
7130456 all this is subject to investigation but we know that our police member discharged a firearm at the driver of the vehicle the vehicle carried on for a short distance about a block and a 34 year old male was taken into custody and then immediately taken to hospital by ems for treatment of serious injuries
7130457 its an injury sustained in this incident but not firearm involved he wasnt shot
7130458 they may not have a complete picture of what occurred but they may be able to add a very pertinent piece of information

7130502 it gives all of the voters in the mayo electorate a chance to get an idea of whether its something that we actually believe in or if were just talking from a scriptwriters view
7130503 for the smaller parties and the independents its very difficult for us to compete with the huge budget that the liberal party has
7130504 the liberals have been able to send out about three or four letters so far to most of the voters in the mayo electorate none of us smaller people can compete with that at all
7130505 for a lot of people this will be the only time theyll get to see us candidates and when you consider that one of us will be going to canberra i think the electors actually have a right to see us and hear us and get an idea who we are and what were about

7130525 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7130526 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7130527 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7130528 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7130529 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7130530 obama jumped into political and religious quicksand by picking biden catholic bishops and voters will determine whether the obama biden ticket sinks into political oblivion on november 4
7130531 the question is will catholic bishops be courageous and clear or will they equivocate or remain aloof if catholic bishops priests and laity put catholic teaching on human life the ahead of the democrat party obama is doomed
7130532 the words of john paul ii are clear the issue is our courage and obedience
7130533 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
7130534 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
7130535 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
7130536 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
7130537 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
7130538 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance
7130539 it doesnt matter about service people will wait if they want to eat here if they dont dont come back
7130540 stormed into the area where the church planter was speaking
7130541 boldly and compassionately shared the word of god with the man who sought to take his life
7130542 we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the state of israel and by chance or not also the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the dead sea scrolls we thought that the best way to honor the state of israel is to bring back these major treasures of the jewish nation for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the country
7130543 its hard to overstate the amazing coincidence that the massive scrolls were discovered around the same time in the same months that the state of israel was proclaimed and was founded here in the land again
7130544 i think a strong case could be made for anyone of faith that this is a tremendous act of god to make this available to people at the same time that the state of israel as a people has actually been restored and im not sure and we dont want to overstate the rather amazing timing
7130545 it really is absolutely fascinating its mind blowing stuff this is staggering to hear but im not totally surprised it shows the importance of symbol and worship in everything done in the service of the christian god
7130546 this ratio of dimensions 1 618 to one appears in nature such as in the spiral of seashells and the faces of people considered beautiful such as marilyn monroe it can be seen in notre dame cathedral in paris the alhambra palace of granada in spain the acropolis in athens and the egyptian pyramids but was thought to have been too advanced for the picts
7130547 the feast of the hunters moon means it was the last moon that you could go out and hunt with it would be a slight snow not over an inch good full moon and even the worst hunter could take home something for the winter
7130548 they wanted wood that was white that didnt cause flavor in the food wooden buckets were being used like this until the early 1900s its only when the advent of cheap metal buckets and plastic buckets that this trade went away
7130549 how life used to be in the 1700s i respect them quite a lot now i know what they had to go through
7130550 i always talk about the triple t tradition talent and training
7130551 we have an extremely good school system in our primary schools physical education is mandatory and we actually start competing from early childhood we have our prep school championships primary school championships our secondary school championships
7130552 there are a lot of fast twitch fibres in jamaica
7130553 if the talent pool is of high standard then you dont necessarily need huge numbers of people involved
7130554 if you then have a competitive environment in which to develop that talent and you can keep the most promising kids running track and not lose them to other sports like football cricket or basketball then youre in a good position
7130555 contrast that with the situation in britain where we struggle to keep kids with pace strength and power involved in athletics
7130556 like the usa is noted for basketball we are noted with track and field
7130557 for this olympics weve put up big screens in the towns and heavily populated areas so everyone can watch everybody has just stopped working to watch the races its a great moment in time for us
7130558 jamaica is a small island and well always see emigration as a major activity but these days the majority of our top athletes are home grown and home trained and home developed
7130559 were also getting better prepared both in terms of individual coaches and how we put the team together and create our olympic camp
7130560 this year we moulded them together as a team the team management have been excellent helping everyone to bond success
7130561 theres a comparison to be drawn with kenya and its distance runners
7130562 great athletes tend to develop around other great athletes its very rare to find someone develop into a world class performer on their own
7130563 we have had an anti doping programme for a very long time we were one of the earliest signatures to the wada convention weve had a little delay in terms of our national anti doping programme but that has in no way affected the programme we have in place for our elite athletes
7130564 there has always been a strong programme for high performance athletes and that will continue
7130565 without naming names some of our athletes here have been tested three times in four days to my mind thats ridiculous thats not an anti doping programme thats harassment
7130566 obviously what the competition does has an impact on our success but you have to remember that weve had three world records in all of this
7130567 let them come it will excite the crowd a little more

7130734 one of the networks they were filming through the window of our house they were filming me in the kitchen making something to eat
7130735 i had given him my word that i would keep it in confidence so i did
7130736 he was very gracious in his call and said that he really appreciated getting to know me and held me in very high regard and wanted very much to work with me going forward both in the campaign and with his administration
7130737 its a bit like going through the political equivalent of a colonoscopy
7130738 they go over everything and anything and track down every crazy rumor and all sorts of stuff but the thing i would like to emphasize is it was an honor
7130739 what really matters is getting our country moving in a better direction
7130740 getting the economy turned around getting us out of iraq in a responsible way ending this dependency we have on imported oil which is so damaging look i like john mccain but i really think hes going to offer us more of the same and i think we need change
7130741 the people camped outside in the front of our house for the last three days i think that reminded everybody of the complete loss of any kind of normal life that you have once something like that happens but look they were up for it
7130742 ill be able to be a better dad and a better senator for the people of indiana and both of those things mean a lot to me
7130743 keep them for the scrap book even though they turned out to be a big head fake
7130744 and i wasnt entirely sure which speech i would be giving
7130745 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7130746 that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7130747 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7130748 proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7130749 were looking to see what that can support as far as structured parking and infrastructure
7130750 we all realized that it would be a long process with many steps
7130751 its something im sure they want to measure twice and cut once on
7130752 i would have thought that youd hear something about the plans
7130753 i could see the credit markets having a major impact there
7130754 its pretty clear to us that all of the different conditions that were in the bill that kind of make s it a little more difficult to do the project
7130755 if you impose a sales tax at the mall does that affect sales
7130756 if it affects sales it draws the revenue down and it goes in a circle so the mall is chasing their tails trying to figure out what it all means

7130765 if not then hes been misleading me and a lot of other people for a long long time
7130766 hes a friend of mine hes a wonderful senator im one of joes biggest fans
7130767 his heart is broken because he feels like a god
7130768 so does he mean you are retarded youre not retarded
7130769 he went on and on trying to protect me and saying im his and that he loves too much and being all possessive and sappy and macho i will knock him out myself from the wheelchair
7130770 hes not that crazy or else he would have said i am the sun and my wife is a lightbulb
7130771 you looked so damned dangerous but i knew there was something to you you looked so damned dangerous but i knew there was something you werent telling me

7130785 so the mother is saying we should return home with the breadwinner of the family to mexico and the children are saying i dont want to leave im a u s citizen i dont know that country
7130786 a vote for senator mccain is a vote for the draft period
7130787 at least senator mccain is being honest a vote for him is a vote for the draft period unless senator mccain radically changes his worldview there would be a draft to implement his plans

7130863 you really feel like you are on the edge here
7130864 it is very difficult to say to a driver and engineer that a car should be slower a 1 04 means we arent just fast on the straight but also in the corners if something were to happen it can be very big at some tracks safety hasnt changed over the years but the cars have but i am not talking about mosport in europe we really miss this kind of elevation change and the fast corners we drivers are crazy but not too crazy that we dont think about safety
7130865 its very very very quick year after year i improved nearly 1 7 seconds and we push the limit all the time again the class is important and im very happy that we are at the head of p2

7130871 i think there are a lot of tracks that all the guys like coming to and this is one of them you have a lot of moments here we brush our brakes nearly all the way around except for turn 5 the rest are at 20 percent because you want to maintain your momentum
7130872 weve been working so hard to improve the lap times from last year
7130873 earlier this week we tested and improved especially in the high speed corners im happy with everything the tires and car worked well together i didnt do a perfect lap time but it was enough for pole i made a mistake at turn 3 and lost maybe a tenth or more
7130874 for the race the car should be good and consistent so we will see how things go
7130875 we were on pole at mid ohio as well were still showing that we have the potential to finish on top here

7130926 but first some context progressives whine for context heres context law professor steve diamond is on to billy ayers and his odious old lady bernadine prof diamond is also raising questions about senator obamas debts and obligations to ayers obamas chinaman or rabbi or mentor as my readers are aware i have pointed to the joint participation of senator obama and professor bill ayers in the chicago annenberg challenge an education reform project as evidence of an older and deeper relationship between ayers and obama than the senator has acknowledged because the political views as well as the past criminal behavior of professor ayers represent in my view an authoritarian approach to education and society as a whole i believe that it is important for the public to have as complete an understanding of the ayers obama relationship as possible this professor of law at university of california at san jose is well up on billy ayers and the radical leftist academics who work very closely with him ayers has addressed hugo chavezs revolutionary educators in caracas on a number of occasions most recently 2006 ayers states that education is the key to revolution obama was hired by billy ayers when the bomber directed the annenberg challenge in the 1990s billy ayers daddy thomas ayers ceo of comed and pan philanthropy big shot had bleached his terrorist lads resume not only that billy ayers plucked the plum from annenbergs loot ayers was chairman and director

7131034 people generally understood the situation nobody quit and we said we hoped in the future that the situation will change
7131035 if you just focus on the doom and gloom everybody gets depressed if you focus on an inspiring message everybody thinks youre a pollyanna
7131036 you need to sympathize with the pain people are having yet demand high performance
7131037 when employees see the results of their efforts they understand how that helps the company and how it helps other employees
7131038 if its a toxic environment and youre my manager and you say good morning im thinking what does he really mean by that
7131039 you cant stop that from happening but shes out there every day with folks asking what are you hearing
7131040 the key insight for most managers ought to be that they can improve the situation in their departments even if the company as a whole is doing nothing to improve the situation
7131041 if you always insist that the whole company has to address it in unison then youre saying only the ceo can fix this problem and thats not true

7131066 must be set forth in full in any application for approval of the dismissal or settlement of an action that has been certified as a class action
7131067 because an existing fee splitting agreement could affect a class action courts decision to approve a proposed settlement attorneys would have little incentive to disclose the agreement if they could simply enforce it in a separate action to avoid encouraging the violation of rule 3 769 b and the potential harm to class members from undisclosed conflicts we apply the same prophylactic rule the supreme court applied for violations of rules of professional conduct rule 2 200 and hold that the parties failure to fully disclose the fee splitting agreement to the class action court when they petitioned for approval of the class action settlement bars later enforcement of the agreement

7131072 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored

7131107 im just trying to get an opinion on what i need to do how bad the injury is and if i can do anything to play im going to do the best i can to get back on the field and get ready for carolina
7131108 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice or was dealing with an issue
7131109 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7131110 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7131111 i know i am in the right place and i stand firm with barack obama
7131112 the kind of fighter i want by my side for years to come
7131113 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be
7131114 after decades of steady work across the aisle i know hell be able to help me turn the page on the ugly partisanship in washington so we can bring democrats and republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the american people
7131115 i know that joe biden will give us some real straight talk
7131116 you talk about how much youre worried about having to pay the bills well ladies and gentleman thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7131117 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7131118 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on spread the word
7131119 you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7131120 sign up and you will be the first to know
7131121 yes that was the pre 2008 john mccain hes no longer that guy hes now a puppet for steve schmidt and karl rove
7131122 im watching morning joe and once again there is an annoying sound in the studio
7131123 sign up and you will be the first to know
7131124 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7131125 i am very excited that sen obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate sen biden is a tremendous leader and a great complement to sen obama and his candidacy he has worked as a committed public servant has a proven track record and understands the complex challenges facing our nation the obama biden ticket provides the united states with a new and meaningful dialogue with world leaders and will improve americas standing with our allies and the global community
7131126 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7131127 the candidate of change went with the status quo in picking sen joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions
7131128 t he question is whether bidens depth counters obamas inexperience or highlights it
7131129 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7131130 joe biden is an outstanding public servant with deep experience and a fighting spirit
7131131 people who have got this country to where we are to day
7131132 in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7131133 reflected a critical strategic choice by mr obama to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about gaps in his r sum rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce mr obamas message of change
7131134 biden who has twice sought the white house is a catholic with blue collar roots a generally liberal voting record and a reputation as a long winded orator
7131135 across more than 30 years in the senate he has served at various times not only as chairman of the foreign relations committee but also as head of the judiciary committee with its jurisdiction over anticrime legislation and constitutional issues
7131136 on a day in which speculation about obamas choice reached a fever pitch reporters culled every source for news of the pick even tracing the tail numbers on private planes scheduled to head from the home states of some of the contenders to chicago on saturday morning
7131137 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7131138 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7131139 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7131140 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7131141 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale

7131145 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7131146 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home
7131147 the reason i hadn t confirmed dates in australia is i really didn t know what i was getting into

7131149 this is one of my favorite places to be watching the red sox at fenway
7131150 it looks like i have a special feeling with this race track
7131151 canada always seem to bring me good luck when audi wanted to bring me back and said i could race again at mosport i was very happy it was nice to be back and show that we are still quite good
7131152 you really feel like you are on the edge here
7131153 it is very difficult to say to a driver and engineer that a car should be slower a 1 04 means we arent just fast on the straight but also in the corners if something were to happen it can be very big at some tracks safety hasnt changed over the years but the cars have but i am not talking about mosport in europe we really miss this kind of elevation change and the fast corners we drivers are crazy but not too crazy that we dont think about safety
7131154 its very very very quick year after year i improved nearly 1 7 seconds and we push the limit all the time again the class is important and im very happy that we are at the head of p2
7131155 in the last few races it has been a very big battle with many teams
7131156 we have a lot of cars to watch for its good to be at the front especially with a quick car we had a chance to test here earlier this week and we found a very good setup its all the time a big battle to improve in every area
7131157 ill be the first to admit that im a pretty crappy qualifier so im pretty stoked
7131158 olivier is so good and anytime you outperform him is a good thing the bigger story to me is how hard the guys on the no 4 car worked to get that car ready to go this afternoon i didnt think it would be that close
7131159 its a lot of fun here this is a magical racetrack
7131160 i think there are a lot of tracks that all the guys like coming to and this is one of them you have a lot of moments here we brush our brakes nearly all the way around except for turn 5 the rest are at 20 percent because you want to maintain your momentum
7131161 weve been working so hard to improve the lap times from last year
7131162 earlier this week we tested and improved especially in the high speed corners im happy with everything the tires and car worked well together i didnt do a perfect lap time but it was enough for pole i made a mistake at turn 3 and lost maybe a tenth or more
7131163 for the race the car should be good and consistent so we will see how things go
7131164 we were on pole at mid ohio as well were still showing that we have the potential to finish on top here

7131169 while the circumstances are far from ideal im looking forward to bristol and getting to work with joey logano in this weekends nationwide series race ive had the pleasure of working with joey throughout the past couple of years on the jgr sprint cup test team and ive obviously been impressed with his natural talent and ability to give excellent feedback on the handling of his race car its a really unfortunate situation but we are going to work hard in order to run up front and be in contention to win like this team has all year long
7131170 it will be cool working with wally in a race ive worked with him a lot in the jgr sprint cup testing team but never under race conditions i probably have more time working with wally overall than i have with dave its a really unfortunate situation but i think we can still be really competitive this weekend and beyond we are going to sit down and talk to each other about the car and what we need to do to run well this weekend in bristol he knows what i want in a race car and i know his mindset setting up the car ive really worked with him closely since he came over to jgr in 2006 so it will be nice to still have someone around that im really comfortable with and can communicate well with
7131171 i look forward to it theres no doubt its the most physically demanding track we run at you push so many gs through the corner that you spend so much time down and to the right in the seat and you really dont have much time to think as soon as you come out of the corner and onto the straightaway you are back in the corner again before you know it you have to be on your a game every lap at bristol but i feel like im prepared for a place like bristol even though i dont look it i work out at the shop every day and its one of those races that the workout regimen will always pay off
7131172 i hate it for the guys here we changed everything right after practice trying to get some more speed out of the car and just got really loose i about wrecked on the first lap and i just tried to get a little bit more out of it on the second lap i just got loose i just hate it for the whole gamestop crew we are trying really hard to get another win under our belts and its not what we needed but we will put that behind us and we will go out with the backup car and see what we got
7131173 it was a long day thats for sure its appropriate that we had the call of duty game on the gamestop car tonight because it certainly was a war out there we started in the back and worked on our car and started working our way to the front and finally got some decent track position ive got to hand it to all the guys who worked hard back at the shop and here at the track to get our cars ready to race

7131186 and the kissing itself didnt really bug me from then on it became a normal thing to do
7131187 youre turning on a guy and he thinks its cool
7131188 the term for the im straight but ill kiss girls mentality is heteroflexible
7131189 theyre doing it because they want to appeal to boys their age and for boys their age whove developed sexually alongside internet porn their sexual cues are affected by the norms and standards of porn and thats girl on girl action
7131190 the joint has been infiltrated by a gaggle of giggling straight girls playing gay for a night because it amuses them
7131191 difficult to distinguish between the behavior of someone who is legitimately sexually interested and someone who wants to impress the boy across the room
7131192 a lot of girls who do want long term boyfriends will still settle for the hookup triggered by girl on girl kissing because it gives them that temporary feeling of being taken care of and being close to someone

7131210 designers who focus on producing only meek and sustainable things are denying their own creativity and impact on the world
7131211 what underpins the general shift towards green design is a widespread sense of guilt and self doubt felt by many designers about blighting the world with too much stuff the paradox is that the big idea they turn to for salvation environmentalism means that rather than endeavouring to produce something new to solve the problem one that makes use of the best possible processes ideas and resources designers will attempt to regain a sense of purpose and credibility by preaching to the rest of us to lower our horizons
7131212 isnt design always about making an impact not according to the green design movement or the design deniers who argue for placing limits on human ingenuity and creativity put bluntly they want less of it not more of course there is no ignoring climate change while the science causes and effects are by no means given as discussed many times on spiked placing limits on ingenuity will itself deny us imaginative and mature solutions the greening of design will only contribute to more climate change panic if our hands are tied in finding the best means to deal with a warming world
7131213 and amongst all the debate about limits there is something else under attack something distinctively human that is tied up with the idea of the designer the degradation of objectivity

7131256 with so much at stake the last thing we need is for the real issues to be obscured by discredited arguments and wild theories we must act now to avoid the worst effects so for those who are not sure what to believe heres our guide to climate myths and misconceptions decide for yourself
7131257 myth carbon dioxide levels only rose after the start of warm periods so co2 does not cause warming i t appears the lags might sometimes have been 800 years or more these lags show that rising co2 did not trigger the initial warming at the end of these ice ages but then no one claims it did they do not undermine the idea that more co2 in the atmosphere warms the planet
7131258 our planets climate is anything but simple it depends on the interplay of many factors from massive events in the sun to microscopic creatures in the oceans yet a clear picture has emerged supported by an overwhelming amount of evidence the world is warming this warming is due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases caused by human activity and if emissions continue unabated the warming will too with ever more serious consequences

7131278 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7131279 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7131280 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7131281 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold i competed against biden in the 84 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy he is always extremely well prepared is very smart a top level debater gutsy strong and has great personal integrity
7131282 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7131283 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7131284 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7131285 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7131286 he has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of sen john mccain
7131287 joe brings experience to baracks message of change together democrats are offering the american people change experience and good judgment a winning combination if there ever was one
7131288 joe biden has always been my first choice and i am pleased to learn he is sen obamas first choice as well i am proud of joe and believe his experience in the u s senate and as a national leader in foreign policy makes him an excellent candidate for vice president

7131294 the gardeners were treated and released but the other scholar is still in hospital

7131306 we may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden
7131307 but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god said you must not eat it nor touch it under pain of death
7131308 god knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
7131309 your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
7131310 i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
7131311 have you been eating of the tree i forbade you to eat
7131312 it was the woman you put with me she gave me the fruit and i ate it
7131313 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
7131314 no you will not die god knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
7131315 see the man has become like one of us with his knowledge of good and evil he must not be allowed to stretch his hand out next and pick from the tree of life also and eat some and live forever
7131316 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
7131317 you must not behave as they do in egypt where once you lived you must not behave as they do in canaan where i am taking you you must not follow their laws

7131352 hay una dulce iron a en haber seleccionado a hirschman como uno de los pioneros del desarrollo en una serie de conferencias auspiciadas por el banco mundial porque l comenz su trabajo de campo en colombia contratado por el banco mundial pero tuvo r pidamente que resistir las presiones para impresionar a las autoridades locales con planificaciones m gicas y modelos econ micos

7131356 los modelos basados en agregados como los ahorros las inversiones el pbi y las relaciones capital trabajo me parecen demasiado abstractos y mecanicistas
7131357 no hay nada malo en computar un modelo tipo harrod domar si lo nico que se desea es tener una idea aproximada del monto de capital que probablemente se utilizar en el curso de un proceso de crecimiento

7131359 sus intereses acad micos pasaron de cuestiones t cnicas espec ficas a planteos generales dentro de las ciencias sociales
7131360 una mirada amplia basada en lecturas provenientes de otras disciplinas le permite a hirschman proponer una disciplina econ mica en estrecha relaci n con la pol tica la sociolog a y la tica a trav s de la reconstrucci n del aparato conceptual de la econom a y en especial de su fundamento representacional por excelencia el homo economicus para complicar la historia econ mica es decir para expandir su campo de preocupaciones desplazar el inter s de los investigadores hacia reas poco exploradas y permitir m s f rtiles interrelaciones entre fen menos econ micos y extraecon micos se requiere primero complicar la teor a econ mica la figura de hirschman como complicador o cr tico de la teor a econ mica merecer a un lugar destacado en cualquier historia referida a esta cuesti n
7131361 para hirschman un objetivo b sico de los an lisis hist ricos es el de mostrar el rol de lo excepcional y lo impredecible en los hechos humanos
7131362 caracter sticas importantes en el enfoque de hirschman el rol del relato de los casos la historia de los eventos junto a su contexto hist rico la importancia de la singularidad junto a la de la regularidad y la constelaci n de eventos que caracteriza tanto los cambios profundos como los menos dram ticos
7131363 su obra puede dividirse en 2 grandes estrategias o proyectos por un lado la b squeda de los or genes de la atrofia los sesgos y las limitaciones del discurso econ mico y por el otro el esfuerzo de ampliar el mbito conceptual de la econom a criticando sus conceptos fundacionales y proponiendo nuevas perspectivas de an lisis
7131364 si bien le interesa la cuesti n de la decisi n p blica no le entusiasma reducir el an lisis pol tico al esquema del an lisis econ mico
7131365 su enfoque mira m s all de las variables abstractas que le interesan a los economistas como ahorro inversi n competencia maximizacion de utilidades y eficiencia para concentrarse en las actitudes y conductas de los actores econ micos concretos y en el ambiente institucional en el cual tienen que tomar sus decisiones
7131366 los sujetos econ micos los consumidores por ejemplo no son tontos racionales frase acu ada por amartya sen sino individuos dotados de diversas sensibilidades y valoraciones adem s de gustos experiencias previas sobre las cuales analizan las opciones presentes y muy especialmente recursos ret ricos tomados de su propia cultura que los condicionan a mirar la econom a en forma integrada con fen menos pol ticos y sociales y a plantearse opciones no imaginadas por la teor a econ mica por ejemplo entre actividades instrumentales y no instrumentales
7131367 hirschman insiste en que hay que tomar con pinzas la rigurosidad de las leyes
7131368 es un economista disidente pero no uno que disienta a favor de alguna otra ortodoxia
7131369 su percepci n es que buscar la verdad completa de cualquier porci n de la realidad social nos llevar a a planos tan complicados que nos superar an
7131370 en la poca en que se gest la econom a del desarrollo es decir desde fines de la d cada de 1950 hasta la de los 70s hirschman fue el m s imaginativo iconoclasta de los que se ocuparon de la cuesti n un te rico no convencional que contrastaba la sabidur a aceptada en cada momento contra sus propias experiencias personales lo cual generalmente implicaba proponer un enfoque alternativo que desafiaba y enriquec a el estudio del desarrollo
7131371 en 1971 bautiz como posibilismo al resultado de muchos de sus an lisis que elabor en libros y art culos cuando las ciencias sociales buscan exclusivamente leyes generales oscurecen el rol irreductible de la unicidad e impredicibilidad de los hechos humanos despu s de tantas profec as que no se materializaron no estar a en el inter s de las ciencias sociales incorporar la complejidad aunque sacrifique parcialmente su poder predictivo
7131372 lo m s cerca que hirschman escribi para describir su propio enfoque para encarar las ciencias sociales es su ensayo titulado econom a pol tica y posibilismo que prologa la colecci n de art culos recogidos en bias h 1971
7131373 en cada episodio en el cual el progreso econ mico aument la disponibilidad de bienes para cierto grupo social fuertes sentimientos de desilusi n y hasta de hostilidad fueron generados la afluencia produce su propia reacci n casi independientemente de cu les son los bienes nuevos que se comercializan de manera m s abundante esta cita captura buena parte de los elementos que hacen de hirschman un cientista social da un paso m s al integrar tambi n a los valores seg n el los economistas hemos cometido un grueso error al tratar el amor la benevolencia y particularmente la pasi n por la cosa p blica como si fueran recursos escasos que hay que economizar
7131374 su evoluci n fue en direcci n contraria a la corriente principal de los economistas muchos colegas se hubieran sentido inc modos en dicha situaci n a hirschman por el contrario no le disgusta el rol de disidente en su autoimpuesto rol se propuso destacar que el emperador las ciencias sociales y la reina la econom a no est n tan vestidos como nos gustar a creer una de las debilidades del trabajo de hirschman es que no especifica claramente el proceso por el cual valida sus afirmaciones con frecuencia el lector queda con la impresi n de que las tendencias y regularidades observadas no surgen de chequeos sistem ticos y suficientemente generales tuvo un impacto limitado sobre el resto de los economistas por el contrario tuvo mucho m s impacto en el resto de las ciencias sociales as que tiene m s fuerza como cientista social que como economista
7131375 el desarrollo es mucho m s dif cil de lo que a veces se cree el desarrollo no depende tanto de saber encontrar las combinaciones ptimas de recursos y factores de producci n dados como de conseguir en funci n del proceso aquellos recursos y capacidades que se encuentran ocultos diseminados o mal utilizados la tensi n del desarrollo no se encuentra tanto en la pugna entre la ganancia y los costos conocidos como en la pugna entre la meta y la ignorancia y desconocimiento del camino que conduce a esa meta la planeaci n del desarrollo consiste principalmente en ir implantando sistem ticamente una serie de proyectos que aceleren el paso el recurso escaso e imposible de economizar en los pa ses en v as de desarrollo es la capacidad de tomar nuevas decisiones de inversi n
7131376 la idea que hay detr s del desarrollo desequilibrado es la de maximizar los procesos decisorios inducidos
7131377 en una pel cula inolvidable el pibe charlie chaplin desempe ando el papel de vidriero emplea a jackie coogan para que le tire piedras a las vidrieras de las tiendas despu s pasa por ah providencialmente y consigue el trabajo de reparar el da o aqu lo ingenioso del asunto consiste en combinar bajo un solo mando las funciones desequilibradoras y equilibradoras desde nuestro punto de vista lo nico malo de la historia es el hecho de que la acci n desequilibradora es destructiva en lugar de constructiva para ser efectivo el proceso de crecimiento tiene que comenzar a empujones estoy totalmente en desacuerdo con la doctrina del crecimiento equilibrado propuesta por rosenstein rodan nurkse lewis y scitovsky mi cr tica principal es que la teor a fracasa como teor a del desarrollo su aplicaci n requiere precisamente montos enormes de aquellas capacidades cuya oferta es muy limitada en los pa ses subdesarrollados la pol tica de desarrollo debe ocuparse de erigir la clase de secuencias y repercusiones tan acertadamente descritas por scitovsky en lugar de intentar suprimirlas hay que distinguir entre los eslabonamientos anteriores es decir hacia los insumos y los posteriores hacia las actividades que utilizan los productos que elabora el sector en cuesti n la industria con mayores eslabonamientos es la del hierro y el acero es muy posible que al prestarle atenci n a esta industria los pa ses subdesarrollados no sean tan tontos como se cree ni lo hagan simplemente por el prestigio que reporta
7131378 los est mulos hacia inversiones adicionales son diferentes en los eslabonamientos anteriores y posteriores puede haber resistencia por parte de los productores de encarar los eslabonamientos anteriores y seguir prefiriendo por ejemplo insumos importados en cambio los eslabonamientos posteriores son muy bienvenidos por dichos productores quienes ven as ampliado el mercado interno para sus productos
7131379 los eslabonamientos tienen una relaci n m s bien ilusoria con la matriz de insumo producto porque este ltimo an lisis es por definici n sincr nico mientras que los efectos de eslabonamientos se desarrollan en el tiempo la matriz no dice cu les son las actividades industriales que deben ser creadas a partir del est mulo adicional
7131380 cuando guido di tella me invit a esta conferencia celebrada en toledo espa a en mayo de 1984 me dijo que en argentina muchos piensan que strategy influy en la pol tica econ mica del gobierno presidido por frondizi lo cual fue una gran sorpresa para m y me cuesta creerlo desde el punto de vista temporal mi libro se public en ingl s en el oto o septentrional de 1958 y en castellano reci n en 1961 una explicaci n m s plausible es la siguiente deriv mis ideas sobre industrializaci n en los pa ses en v as de desarrollo de las experiencias de colombia y brasil podr a ser que el programa de metas de juscelino kubitschek presidente de brasil entre 1956 y 1961 haya servido de modelo para frondizi y frigerio
7131381 cuando en 1968 visit argentina el gobierno me explic que estaba aplicando mi teor a porque hab a desbalanceado la estrategia ocup ndose primero del tiempo econ mico despu s del social y por ltimo del pol tico casi me desmay al escuchar esto
7131382 una figura l der en la teor a del desarrollo econ mico desde la publicaci n de strategy
7131383 fue uno de los libros publicados en la d cada de 1950 m s influyentes en la literatura del desarrollo econ mico
7131384 es su contribuci n central a la econom a del desarrollo el an lisis de los eslabonamientos gener criterios de inversi n muy diferentes de los existentes hasta el momento el desarrollo puede ser estimulado a trav s de una escasez de infraestructura ejemplo la producci n de bienes que hay que transportar a los mercados puede inducir la construcci n de carreteras
7131385 antes de que hirschman 1958 acu ara el concepto de
7131386 los planes nacionales deb an localizar los cuellos de botella no para adaptarse a ellos sino para eliminarlos
7131387 fu a colombia sin saber nada y sin haber le do nada de econom a del desarrollo porque ello le permitir a ver la realidad sin prejuicios como gerschenkron hirschman vi el desarrollo como el deliberado intento de recuperar el tiempo perdido m s que como una forma de enfrentar escaseces objetivas o prerrequisitos espec ficos gerschenkron utiliz el concepto de retraso econ mico relativo no s lo para explicar las caracter sticas espec ficas de la industrializaci n de francia alemania y rusia sino tambi n para mostrar que cada intento de desarrollo fue acompa ado por un conjunto de ideas referidas a la causa del retraso y los remedios para curarlo lamentablemente esta generalizaci n no parece ser v lida en am rica latina
7131388 est basado en el estudio de 3 casos el nordeste de brasil la reforma agraria en colombia y la inflaci n en chile el cap tulo 4 se denomina resoluci n de problemas y hechura de la pol tica econ mica un estilo latinoamericano idealmente se pueden definir 2 formas de atacar los problemas en uno el diagn stico induce la propuesta y en otro la propuesta antecede al diagn stico el primero es t pico de las sociedades m s desarrolladas el segundo subproducto de la ansiedad es m s t pico de los reci n llegados los pa ses en v as de desarrollo en estos ltimos los responsables de la pol tica econ mica tienen fuertes motivaciones para actuar al comienzo simplemente para tratar de pacificar la protesta los pseudo conocimientos frecuentemente bloquean los procesos de aprendizaje
7131389 dos a os despu s de publicar strategy hirschman se dedic a la econom a pol tica del desarrollo la toma de decisiones p blica era un campo de estudio no explorado el la analiz desde la perspectiva de la secuencia decisoria estudi la econom a pol tica del cambio encontr muchas cosas positivas en am rica latina que no eran reconocidas por los latinoamericanos acu ando el t rmino fracasoman a
7131390 una insistencia casi patol gica de calificar a las pol ticas pasadas como inadecuadas o condenadas al fracaso y una insistencia casi m rbida de pensar que los que se llevaron a la pr ctica fueron esfuerzos tibios y parciales
7131391 en journeys h 1963 el enfoque es m s el de un politic logo que el de un economista
7131392 development h 1967 completa una trilog a iniciada con strategy h 1958 y continuada con journeys h 1963
7131393 los proyectos de desarrollo son una part cula privilegiada del proceso de desarrollo ninguno de los proyectos estudiados careci de problemas serios r pidamente me qued en claro que todos los proyectos son un permanente enfrentar problemas y que la nica distinci n v lida parece ser entre cuando se vencen las dificultades m s o menos exitosamente y cuando no analic 11 proyectos financiados por el banco mundial ubicados en ecuador autopistas el salvador energ a el ctrica etiop a telecomunicaciones india desarrollo m ltiple del valle de un r o italia irrigaci n nigeria ferrocarriles pakist n industria per irrigaci n tailandia irrigaci n y uruguay ganado dediqu entre 2 y 5 semanas a la inspecci n in situ de cada proyecto mi esposa particip activamente en los preparativos y en las entrevistas durante el viaje escribi un diario el cual junto con las notas de las entrevistas result invalorable a la hora de escribir lo redact en nueva york entre febrero y julio de 1966 hirschman 1967
7131394 en pakist n la industrial development corporation instal una planta de pulpa y papel que se abastecer a con la enorme cantidad de bamb existente en la zona a comienzos de la d cada de 1960 el bamb comenz a florecer lo cual implicaba la inutilidad de la planta se organiz un programa para desarrollar nuevas variedades de bamb que crecieran m s r pidamente en diversas formas esto lo verifiqu en varios de los proyectos analizados la clave es la combinaci n de amenazas inesperadas a la ganancia y existencia misma del proyecto y la aparici n de alternativas tambi n inesperadas en el momento de adoptarse la decisi n estamos delante de un principio general de la acci n la creatividad siempre nos sorprende la nica manera de que aflore la creatividad es frente a un desaf o concreto este es el principio de la mano escondida hiding hand el ser humano encara problemas que cree que puede resolver encuentra luego que las dificultades son mayores a las esperadas en el momento de tomar la decisi n pero como ya comenz ataca las dificultades inesperadas a veces con xito como consecuencia del principio de la mano escondida los aversos al riesgo a veces encaran acciones objetivamente riesgosas el principio de la mano escondida es esencialmente uno que induce la acci n a trav s del error el error de subestimar las dificultades el principio act a fundamentalmente a trav s de la ignorancia de la ignorancia de las incertidumbres y de las dificultades
7131395 la creatividad siempre aparece de manera sorpresiva as que a pesar de que el xito depende de ella no tendemos a confiar en ella en otros t rminos subestimamos nuestra creatividad intentamos cosas porque subestimamos los costos ste es el fundamento del principio de la mano escondida los arquitectos del cambio social nunca cuentan con un manual confiable los grandes cambios que se producen en per odos breves son impredecibles e irrepetibles
7131396 en development hirschman trat de explicar por qu los ferrocarriles nigerianos funcionaban tan mal en comparaci n con el transporte terrestre un comentarista sugiri que subyaciendo la explicaci n de hirschman deb a haber supuestos ocultos
7131397 exit es un libro no premeditado subproducto de un hecho que v en los ferrocarriles de nigeria tuve que explicar por qu dichos ferrocarriles funcionaban tan mal frente a la competencia de los camiones a n en el caso de cargas de gran volumen y poco valor donde ten an ventaja comparativa mi respuesta fue que la disponibilidad de una alternativa disminu a en vez de aumentar la presi n para modificar el funcionamiento de los ferrocarriles en este caso la salida era un elemento nocivo para el cambio otro ejemplo es el de las escuelas p blicas y privadas en estados unidos queja alude a la pretensi n de cambiar en vez de escapar de una realidad insatisfactoria
7131398 la queja no es nunca f cil y hasta puede ser peligrosa
7131399 la falta de sensibilidad a la salida por parte de las empresas u oficinas p blicas tiene que ver con que su financiamiento no depende de la generaci n de sus propios ingresos la queja es la nica alternativa que tienen los consumidores insatisfechos cuando la salida no es una opci n ejemplos la familia la tribu el estado la iglesia
7131400 en econom a entre las principales aplicaciones del esquema salida queja figuran los sindicatos los servicios p blicos educaci n salud etc las migraciones la acci n pol tica y la familia
7131401 a ra z de la lealtad los consumidores continuar n demandando un producto a pesar de la ca da de su calidad y hablar n en voz cada vez m s alta para llamar la atenci n de los due os de la empresa antes de comprarle a la competencia
7131402 hirschman explic exit and voice a trav s del modelo hidr ulico el deterioro genera presiones basadas en la frustraci n que se canalizan hacia la salida o hacia la queja cuanto mayor sea la frustraci n canalizada hacia la salida menor presi n queda para la queja
7131403 las explicaciones del orden desorden o del equilibrio desequilibrio se han planteado dentro de disciplinas espec ficas como el an lisis econ mico y el an lisis pol tico dado que ambos est n relacionados ser a interesante armar un esquema que las uniera esta es la pretensi n de la perspectiva salida queja
7131404 en exit afront cuestiones m s generales de las ciencias sociales econom a y pol tica
7131405 en exit hirschman observ que los economistas ignoran el rol de la queja asociada con el campo pol tico as como not que los analistas pol ticos ignoran el rol de la salida asociada con el campo econ mico
7131406 exit mostr la riqueza inesperada de aplicar el enfoque posibilista m s all de la econom a
7131407 seg n casanova exit es una obra maestra absolutamente inclasificable
7131408 en national power h 1945 mostr que los efectos pol ticos del comercio internacional muy probablemente fueran asim tricos a favor al menos inicialmente de los pa ses m s grandes y m s ricos este hallazgo fue una de las razones por las cuales mi libro fue redescubierto durante la d cada de 1960 por economistas como fernando henrique cardoso osvaldo sunkel y andr gunder frank cuando desarrollaron la denominada teor a de la dependencia
7131409 econom a pol tica political economics o econom a y pol tica y posibilismo
7131410 no siempre se distingue entre las te ricas econ micas de la pol tica y las teor as de la econom a pol tica
7131411 la mayor a de los cientistas sociales piensa que su nica tarea consiste en descubrir regularidades relaciones estables y secuencias uniformes esto es importante pero en ciencias sociales tambi n tiene sentido hacer lo contrario subrayar la multiplicidad y el desorden creativo de la aventura humana destacar la especificidad de cada evento y percibir las nuevas vueltas de tuerca luego de los cambios hist ricos
7131412 durante una reciente visita a una capital de am rica latina quer a tomar contacto con x un historiador econ mico que hab a regresado de europa hac a alg n tiempo cenando en la casa de un soci logo le pregunt si conoc a a x lo conoc a muy bien le pregunt si ten a su n mero de tel fono no lo ten a pero seguramente que lo conseguir a pregunt ndole a un amigo pero el amigo no estaba en la casa pregunt si por casualidad el n mero no podr a estar en la gu a telef nica pero me respondieron que la gu a s lo lista a personas emigradas o muertas luego apareci un economista a quien le pregunt por el n mero de tel fono me respondi que x deb a estar muy ocupado y que ser a dif cil encontrarlo al otro d a en mi hotel encontr una gu a telef nica x figuraba lo llam y habl con el sin ninguna dificultad
7131413 la gente acepta un aumento en la desigualdad de los ingresos pensando que se trata de un fen meno transitorio cuando deja de verlo como transitorio reacciona
7131414 passions h 1977 para m un libro muy importante es verdaderamente el fruto de una creaci n libre no lo escrib contra nadie su redacci n me ha producido un enorme placer escribir y sentirme libre de descubrir cosas sin tener que probar que otro se equivoca esa fue una experiencia bastante singular
7131415 este ensayo debe su origen a la incapacidad de la ciencia social contempor nea para arrojar luz sobre las consecuencias pol ticas del crecimiento econ mico y quiz s en mayor medida a n a las correlaciones pol ticas del crecimiento econ mico tan frecuentemente desastrosas independientemente de si tal crecimiento ocurre bajo auspicios capitalistas socialistas o mixtos lo nuevo surgi de lo antiguo en mayor medida de lo que generalmente se cree la historia real es mucho m s compleja y enredada y comenz en el renacimiento hasta maquiavelo los fil sofos morales y pol ticos hab an hablado s lo de lo imaginario y no hab an prove do orientaciones para el mundo real donde el pr ncipe debe desenvolverse esta exigencia de un enfoque cient fico positivo se extendi s lo m s tarde del pr ncipe al individuo de la naturaleza del estado a la naturaleza humana en el renacimiento surgi el sentimiento de que ya no pod a confiarse en la filosof a moralizante y el precepto religioso para el freno de las pasiones destructoras de los hombres lo cual sugiri 3 formas de acci n la represi n el control y la sustituci n de unas pasiones por otras no ser posible discriminar entre las pasiones y combatir el fuego con el fuego utilizar un conjunto de pasiones relativamente inocuas para contrarrestar otras m s peligrosas y destructivas el principio de la pasi n compensadora surgi en el siglo xvii el inter s y los intereses como domadora de pasiones inter s no se limitaba a los aspectos materiales del bienestar de una persona sino que abarcaba la totalidad de las aspiraciones humanas pero denotaba un elemento de reflexi n y c lculo sobre la forma en que estas aspiraciones deb an perseguirse es probable que la imagen del comerciante como un hombre pac fico e inofensivo haya cobrado alguna fuerza por comparaci n con los ej rcitos saqueadores y los piratas asesinos de la poca la creencia de que el inter s podr a considerarse una motivaci n dominante en el comportamiento humano provoc gran excitaci n intelectual por fin se hab a descubierto una base realista para un orden social viable adem s ten a varias ventajas espec ficas por ejemplo la de la previsi n adam smith abandon la distinci n entre intereses y pasiones al formular su argumento a favor de la b squeda irrestricta de la ganancia privada el efecto principal de la riqueza de las naciones fue el establecimiento de una poderosa justificaci n econ mica para la b squeda irrestricta del inter s individual mientras que en la literatura anterior se hacia hincapi en los efectos pol ticos de esa b squeda
7131416 interests alude a la fuerza que en pos de la autopreservaci n y el autoagradamiento motiva las acciones de un pr ncipe un individuo o un grupo social 2 elementos fundamentales caracterizan la acci n basada en los intereses pensar en las consecuencias de la decisi n sobre el propio decisor y c lculo racional
7131417 as como maquiavelo le abri nuevas perspectivas a la acci n del pr ncipe mandeville la f bula de las abejas se las abri a hacer dinero en un caso y en el otro nuevas ense anzas sobre la naturaleza humana fueron originalmente expuestas como paradojas smith hizo por mandeville lo que el duque de rohan hab a hecho por maquiavelo
7131418 uno de los principales hallazgos de su investigaci n fue que los intereses o el mercado no fueron alentados tanto por la mejora econ mica que implicar an como por su potencial civilizador junto a restringir las pasiones del soberano volver a a la gente m s cort s y cauta introduciendo costumbres m s civilizadas y generando mejores ciudadanos
7131419 en passions construy una teor a del comportamiento humano que generaliza la perspectiva que surge de la basada en el inter s individual al asignarle un rol a las pasiones
7131420 en passions hirschman sienta las bases de su estrategia geneal gica buscando en textos previos a la revoluci n industrial los argumentos que hicieron posible una visi n favorable a la acumulaci n de riqueza y que sentaron las bases sobre las que se construir a la econom a pol tica
7131421 no estoy seguro de que este libro puede ser calificado como un trabajo de ciencias sociales est muy relacionado con cambios y cataclismos est muy cercano a la novela conceptual el largo per odo de paz y prosperidad creciente anterior a la primera guerra mundial en importantes sectores medios y altos gener un sentimiento de rechazo hacia el orden burgu s la seguridad adquisividad y mezquindad para estos grupos la guerra fue vista inicialmente como un escape del aburrimiento y el vac o shifting se ocupa de un caso particular de un principio general c mo explicar el cambio en las preferencias del ser humano mi punto b sico es que los actos de consumo as como los actos de militancia pol tica que se llevan a cabo en funci n de ciertas expectativas tambi n generan desilusiones e insatisfacciones los seres humanos siempre estamos insatisfechos seg n el historiador ruso karamzin d sele a un hombre todo lo que desea y en el mismo instante sentir que ese todo no es todo seg n bernard shaw en la vida hay 2 tragedias no lograr nuestros deseos y lograrlos a veces la realidad supera a las expectativas pero lo normal es que ocurra lo contrario la desilusi n es la contrapartida de la propensi n humana a generar expectativas y aspiraciones magnificentes qu ser a la vida sin esa producci n incesante de dichas expectativas y aspiraciones que finalmente se frustran problema micro macro hay momentos en los cuales grandes grupos humanos pueden sentir igual y por consiguiente moverse en el mismo sentido de lo privado a lo p blico o viceversa the joyless economy de tibor scitovsky contrasta placer mientras se come al pasar de la falta de confort al confort y confort luego de comer el confort es el enemigo del placer esto se ve particularmente en los bienes durables de consumo donde su existencia termina d ndose por descontada genera confort pero ya no placer en occidente cada vez que el progreso econ mico aument la oferta de bienes para algunos estratos de la sociedad se generaron en los otros fuertes sentimientos de desilusi n y hostilidad la afluencia parece producir su propia reacci n si el aumento de la riqueza va a los pobres los conservadores protestan porque ello pone en peligro el orden social si no va a los pobres los progresistas est n aterrados por el aumento en la desigualdad de la distribuci n del ingreso participan en pol tica los que tienen cuando se aburren y los que no tienen pero unos y otros est n por la reforma es probable que una revoluci n surja cuando la insatisfacci n de los que no tienen coincida con la desilusi n de los que s tienen the logic of collective action de olson mostr dado el fen meno del free ride cu n poca ser a la participaci n del ciudadano en cuestiones pol ticas parad jicamente fue publicado al comienzo de gran efervescencia pol tica d nde se equivoc el efecto repercusi n rebound sostiene que despu s de una experiencia negativa en la acci n se exageran los beneficios y se subestiman los costos el argumento del free ride para explicar la falta de acci n pol tica ignora la diferencia entre el empe o striving y el logro attaining el esfuerzo en pol tica no es parte del costo sino del beneficio en 1977 golda meir explic que migr a israel en 1921 porque soy ego sta cuando escuch lo que hab a que hacer decid que no lo har an por ellos mismos sino que deb a ser parte de ello la vida p blica tambi n genera desilusiones a veces porque se consiguen los logros qu le queda por hacer a un republicano luego de la ca da de la monarqu a y a un separatista luego de la secesi n la vida p blica desilusiona porque demanda m s tiempo del previsto y porque la pol tica se rige por l gica pol tica es decir formaci n de alianzas abandono de los objetivos reales de uno traici n a los amigos de ayer etc
7131422 en shifting involvements h 1982 hirschman retoma los conceptos de salida y queja para aplicarlos a los ciclos de acci n privada p blica que parecen caracterizar a muchas sociedades de mercado por alguna raz n los agentes econ micos concentran sus esfuerzos en la vida privada y en la acumulaci n de riquezas durante un per odo de tiempo mientras que en el siguiente algunos de ellos se lanzan a diversas formas de acci n p blica la pol tica los sindicatos las actividades comunitarias etc hirschman intenta en este libro una fenomenolog a de las desilusiones colectivas y de la participaci n comunitaria que explique aquellos ciclos
7131423 shifting involvements analiza el cambiante compromiso de los funcionarios p blicos con lo p blico y los privado en econom as de mercado
7131424 es algo bueno tener opiniones anton chekhov dir a que no tener opiniones equivale a no tener individualidad personalidad identidad car cter ego y por consiguiente no puede tener autoestima y si analizamos las opiniones como cualquier otro bien dir amos que cuantas m s opiniones tengamos y m s fuertes sean mejor la realidad es un poco m s complicada desde el punto de vista del funcionamiento de una democracia demasiadas opiniones planteadas de manera tajante puede ser un problema m s que una soluci n esto se refiere al plano pol tico en el plano econ mico el mismo an lisis se puede plantear al analizar los gustos
7131425 en el mbito del consumo hay que distinguir entre las preferencias las que se revelan y las metapreferencias las que interrogan sobre si las verdaderamente preferidas son las reveladas porque estas ltimas explican los cambios en las preferencias en el mbito de la producci n existen los trabajos instrumentales de los que se ocupa el an lisis econ mico pero tambi n existen los no instrumentales actividades que se llevan a cabo porque s referido a las actividades no rutinarias existe el siguiente enigma desde el comienzo de la humanidad hombres y mujeres parecen haber dedicado una porci n considerable de su tiempo a ocupaciones cuyo resultado es simplemente impredecible por ejemplo la b squeda de la verdad la belleza la justicia la libertad la comunidad la amistad el amor la salvaci n etc escribiendo libros participando en pol tica etc tales esfuerzos m s que de trabajo tienen que ver con el empe o striving un t rmino que capta la falta de relaci n confiable entre el esfuerzo y el resultado en estas circunstancias el c lculo beneficio costo es imposible no solamente el resultado es totalmente incierto sino que las actividades en que se incurre no siempre son placenteras en s mismas y muchas veces son extenuantes y altamente riesgosas por qu los seres humanos se dedican a ellas por empe arse y conseguir algo striving and attaining seg n pascal el cristiano goza ya de sus creencias sobre lo que va a ocurrir luego de esta tierra los economistas tratan la moralidad el esp ritu c vico la confianza y la observancia de ciertas normas ticas elementales como un insumo que como existe en cantidades fijas debe ser economizado pero un momento de reflexi n es suficiente para advertir que la analog a no s lo es cuestionable sino que resulta un poco absurda y hasta graciosa la cantidad de amor puede aumentar con el uso as como disminuir como la habilidad para hablar idiomas extranjeros o tocar el piano con la falta de uso ejemplo el mercado de la donaci n de sangre todas estas complicaciones para el an lisis econ mico surgen de la complejidad incre ble de la naturaleza humana que fue ignorada por la teor a tradicional por muy buenas razones pero que deben ser incorporadas al an lisis para mejorarlo

7131429 para complicar la historia econ mica reflexiones en torno a la obra de albert o hirschman
7131430 el modelo gerencial de las empresas tiene cien a os y est obsoleto
7131431 lord if i could reach out to one soul just one soul in this university even before i graduate mamatay na kong masaya
7131432 hello awkward position can you imagine me praying for someone in the mrt are you sure you want me to do this
7131433 a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest
7131434 your poverty will come in like a vagabond and your need like an armed man
7131435 poor is he who works with a negligent hand but the hand of the diligent makes rich
7131436 for even when we were with you we used to give you this order if anyone is not willing to work then he is not to eat either
7131437 of course he doesnt you dont see him do you
7131438 ooh what a beautiful tree there must be a god
7131439 that their pronunciamento was no longer a matter of words alone easy to make and put into writing cowardly fled
7131440 david sommeil has slowly left the state of sedation in which he was placed artificially after his heart attack
7131441 the patient is stable from a cardiac point of view
7131442 he can move his right side and the left leg he can talk only a little as he has a throat inflammation
7131443 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
7131444 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7131445 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7131446 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7131447 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7131448 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7131449 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7131450 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7131451 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on
7131452 i was kind of fed up with all the visiting journalists talking negatively about china
7131453 they said anybody can protest and because i didnt want to involve anyone else i said ill do a protest with my son who is 4 well protest against pollution
7131454 when i asked for an application form they said we dont have any
7131455 at 4 30 after three hours i said this is all great i appreciate what you are doing but i have an aiyi who needs to leave at 5 p m
7131456 at one point i said everyone has been very nice to me for the last two days
7131457 the next day i went back to the police station to get the application
7131458 they said will you be walking the whole time or standing
7131459 they said it is not that we wont approve the application but your son is too young to protest
7131460 i said we met for nine hours and you never told me this and besides i studied the new protest law and its not in there
7131461 you cannot protest legally in china but one thing is not clear will they renew my visa in december
7131462 i have no problem with him doing a show but i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands
7131463 you know nothing is old fashioned if its about making people comfortable or about making money and thats why people hire me
7131464 the attitude has changed people dont burst out laughing over the word etiquette anymore as they did 30 years ago
7131465 people are at the point and they have been for the last 10 years and im getting impatient where they say we should have better manners of course when they say we they dont include themselves
7131466 we are interacting with so many nations that its become almost imperative to get this kind of training
7131467 avoiding even simple faux pas can put you ahead of the competition
7131468 due to ignorance they are sometimes misunderstood abroad as being disrespectful people try to do their best but sometimes they just dont know
7131469 i would say the rest of the world doesnt appreciate our casual attitude toward addressing people who are senior to us you have to present yourself as respectful in order to create that business relationship
7131470 something very informal that happened to a society that already was quite informal
7131471 while informality is not tantamount to incivility very often one leads to the other
7131472 more than 90 percent of workers in america have experienced incivility
7131473 when they dont leave the company they take sick days absenteeism ensues work diminishes allegiance to the company deteriorates so it is extremely expensive
7131474 russias disproportionate actions in the caucasus have raised a lot of concerns here and the concerns are growing
7131475 the number of supporters of the idea of joining nato is likely to increase
7131476 interference in these issues will not lead to anything good
7131477 if russia ever attacks ukraine the world will know the truth that russia is a real armed monster
7131478 thats why we should hurry up and stay close to nato
7131479 its clear that the events in georgia infringe on azerbaijans interests directly and make azerbaijan very wary
7131480 essential gay lesbian bisexual and transgender glbt character of oxford st
7131481 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts similar to the safe place pink triangle campaign

7131500 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in

7131523 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7131524 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7131525 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future

7131532 i dont have anything made yet for my baby but maybe i will
7131533 i think your mother instincts really kick in the day you find out that youre pregnant and for me its been a blast preparing for it getting the nursery ready and all that so were both really looking forward to it
7131534 thats definitely the frustrating part about it but our home is very private and what goes on in our home is very private
7131535 people just really see pictures and make assumptions of what were doing

7131544 it feels great to be back in the tournament where i did really well last year
7131545 i was really close to the title and i had some exhausting matches but this is where i think i felt really confident after that i started believing more that i can win a grand slam title which i did this year
7131546 as a grand slam winner you get some kind of relief and you get motivation to claim even more titles

7131551 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7131552 if the project an eu olympic team seems ambitious the concept is rather easy to understand at every international sports competition we realise that if the european countries medals were counted together the european union would have a much stronger weight in the traditional medals list and would be able to really compete with the usa china or russia
7131553 its also a way to combat nationalism that is always very fast in spreading on these sportive occasions which is often a pity since the spirit of sports and fair competition should be promoting tolerance mutual respect and intercultural understanding
7131554 the young european federalists really do need to grow up
7131555 britains amazing athletes have shown us how britain can be one of the best in sport
7131556 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is frankly bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7131557 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7131558 their eu funding should be scrapped and put to better use giving it back to european countries to help their sportsmen is one option that springs to mind

7131565 we started doubting chandans sincerity and felt he was actually in touch with the kidnapper when the kidnapper called the second time a policeman answered the call but the kidnapper said he wants to talk to zabbar this confirmed our hunch that someone known to zabbar was involved
7131566 when police team enquired with the pco owner in moti nagar they were told the man who used the phone was also wearing a yellow shirt this further raised our suspicion

7131572 premiare il merito e introdurre una rivoluzione che indispensabile perch oggi c un livello di insoddisfazione generalizzato tra le famiglie e anche fra gli insegnanti ha proseguito il ministro occorre liberare le risorse oggi il 97 del bilancio del ministero viene utilizzato per pagare stipendi molto bassi la scuola stata utilizzata come uno stipendificio un modo per creare occupazione
7131573 un errore che credo sia stato commesso in buona fede ma che oggi paghiamo e facciamo pagare ai giovani il test elaborato da ocse pisa dice che la nostra scuola al 37esimo posto nella parte bassa della classifica una realt a cui porre rimedio
7131574 la finanziaria prevede una razionalizzazione delle spese e da l passa lintroduzione della meritocrazia e il 30 dei risparmi che andremo a produrre grazie a una riduzione degli sprechi sar cos possibile premiare chi disponibile a fare formazione continuativa chi raggiunge i migliori risultati

7131621 but i did read a lot of british comics when i was very young the stuff was weird in hindsight a football strip called billys boots about a young lad possessed by a dead footballer whenever he tied up the laces on his old boots
7131622 if i said it was a commentary on violence id be sniggering at the same time because lets face it when you write a scene about a bullet taking four panels to pass through a human head you arent thinking about the social commentary
7131623 you just think it looks fucking cool real violence is obviously horrible but these are comic characters or highly paid actors its great watching bad shit happen to them
7131624 moore said all that after finding his greatest success with watchmen one of the darkest books of his generation theres a certain guilt that seems to hit creators after taking these characters to the max but the weird truth is that the greatest sales and greatest excitement comes from the dark stuff my own experience is that the darker you make the material the more popular it is both creatively and commercially who am i but a humble writer i cant argue with the readers

7131679 but the city is still struggling i feel an ache an inner sadness when i catch sight of something that reminds me of katrina like an untended property or broken glass where children play it makes me sad and it makes me angry but it strengthens my resolve to stay involved and active in my neighborhood
7131680 i would say that our block and the part of mid city immediately surrounding us are at about 75 percent of pre katrina population
7131681 there are still many problematic properties for example our next door neighbors house was never gutted and is getting worse each month but there is more permanence among the people who moved in post storm and thats a good thing
7131682 i couldnt imagine not having come back living elsewhere and wondering how things were in new orleans the rebuilding of new orleans is a part of american history one of the most fascinating and important chapters in our lifetimes i wanted to be part of that and in some strange indefinable way it just seemed like the right thing for us to do

7131684 the next vice president of the united states joe biden
7131685 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills but ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7131686 he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america
7131687 but the hard truth is you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7131688 i think everybody in america will know who we picked and why we picked him
7131689 to me its just kind of the culmination of lots of things for him
7131690 it didnt really matter i just wanted obama and i knew he would make a good pick
7131691 its going to become more and more apparent to voters that the experience and knowledge needed to be president is not at the top of the democratic ticket
7131692 we know what were going to get from the other side four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home and a disastrous foreign policy abroad
7131693 we cant afford more of the same i am running for president because thats a future that i dont accept for my daughters and i dont accept it for your children its time for the change that the american people need

7131927 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7131928 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7131929 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7131930 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7131931 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7131932 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7131933 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7131934 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7131935 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now

7131946 he was a good character actor and a good actor in the american tradition of playing variations on oneself

7131954 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7131955 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the centre of an international crisis
7131956 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7131957 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7131958 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7131960 ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7131961 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7131962 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7131963 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7131964 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7131965 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person
7131966 if we do nothing theres a serb victory and the continuation of genocide
7131967 if we do what you want we only have two options
7131968 theyre definitely not a team youd want to face a lot with the pitching staff they have and obviously the hitting they are getting now
7131969 a lot of times especially at this time of year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time and those guys are playing very very well right now
7131970 i guess everyone saying its a totally new me or whatever
7131971 i just went down there and worked on what i worked on while i was here and just got back to myself
7131972 i have a rather large nose and it actually grazed off my nose before it hit my bicep which was kind of funny
7131973 i was actually laughing about it when i was coming back to the dugout it did it actually grazed my nose and hit my bicep next whatever it worked
7131974 i was so bad on friday it couldnt go anywhere but up
7131975 this is how funny this game is you can not get a ball out of the infield one day and do what i did today you take the good with the bad and hopefully you have more days like this
7131976 theres something about telling people theyll go to jail that gets their attention
7131977 how can you violate federal law cause injury and death and have no consequences
7131978 it is critical important to note that the vast majority of survival space was maintained
7131979 in the near future ill be designing my own clothes as well so im looking forward to that
7131980 she was definitely sexy but wasnt trying to be and i loved that
7131981 i really like to do it knitting but i always kind of have a hole in it
7131982 i dont have anything made yet for my baby but maybe i will
7131983 i think your mother instincts really kick in the day you find out that youre pregnant and for me its been a blast preparing for it getting the nursery ready and all that so were both really looking forward to it
7131984 thats definitely the frustrating part about it but our home is very private and what goes on in our home is very private
7131985 people just really see pictures and make assumptions of what were doing
7131986 we havent decided where were going to raise our kid but for the first year well stay in california
7131987 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7131988 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7131989 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7131990 this year superdelegates comprised 20 of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7131991 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7131992 the devil is in the details and thats not something to get into in a national convention
7131993 that in many ways translates to greater knowledge of sexual health and those kids who are more knowledgeable are better prepared to not have sex
7131994 although in the u s american culture is saturated with superficial titillating sexual media the society has more restrictions on teen sex sometimes abstinence is the only sex education program in schools there is an attitude and thats why their teen pregnancy rate is double of what canadas is and they have a higher rate of sexually transmitted infections
7131995 with things so unsettled in pakistan at this point in time my gut feeling is that the september 12 28 champions trophy will have to be postponed till next year as we talk i dont think any other option is feasible
7131996 things have changed for the worse after pervez musharrafs resignation as president it has also left a vacuum in the pakistan cricket board as his appointee as chairman dr nasim ashraf chose to step down as well all this has happened in the past few days
7131997 if the tatas want they can set up operations in maharashtra we shall offer them all facilities and land anywhere they require pune nashik aurangabad or any place of their choice
7131998 we will meet ratan tata to urge him to come to punjab to set up the plant
7131999 we will offer them land either at ropar kapurthala or nabha towns that are close to chandigarh we can provide them a thousand acres or even more wherever they want we will give special concessions also if they desire
7132000 we have enough time in hand let us see what happens on monday
7132001 guruji will be talking to the independents he will tell them that presidents rule followed by mid term polls are not viable alternatives
7132002 theres nothing worse than coming upon a campsite to see where people have thrown things out
7132003 people dont realize how lucky we are in new york state
7132004 there is no state that has a park system as large as new york state we have a resource thats worth protecting for future generations
7132005 having as minimal impact as possible on the environment whether youre camping paddling we try to follow a set of principles with that goal in mind
7132006 a responsible camper tries to leave as little impact on where they have been
7132007 the old days of cutting pine boughs to sleep on are over of digging a trench around your tent and of washing your dishes in the ponds and streams are gone
7132008 theres too many of us out there enjoying it we all cant do that
7132009 one of the things i love about camping is it simplifies life
7132010 especially back country camping it reduces things to the basic survival things shelter water warmth and food life is very clear when things are simple like that
7132011 walk from one spot to another and use it several times after a while you will see a path being formed
7132012 put it back so it looks like you were never there

7132027 with 37 2 billion in revenues in 2007 kft is the largest food manufacturer in the u s and second largest worldwide
7132028 new management has begun to shake things up and the turnaround program is well underway
7132029 the roots of some of krafts products reach all the way back to 1767 but it wasnt until 1903 that james l kraft started his wholesale cheese business from a horse drawn wagon in chicago today kraft produces many of the best known food brands in the world
7132030 in 1988 philip morris renamed altria purchased kraft and in 2000 it integrated the purchase of nabisco into kraft altria sold a small stake to the public in 2001 but maintained majority control until 2007 when the company was completely spun off as an independent company once again
7132031 under the altria umbrella kraft stagnated with declining revenues and little product innovation as a result the stock price today is within 1 of the price where it was when first sold to the public in mid 2001
7132032 new management has begun to shake things up at kraft in june 2006 veteran food executive irene rosenfeld became ceo returning to kraft from a stint at pepsico running its frito lay division

7132038 di michele un giocatore con qualit straordinarie riesce a cambiare il corso delle partite anche se ci sono volont da rispettare da gennaio 2008 e vedremo cosa decider infine il giocatore per quanto riguarda la squadra limportante raggiungere una condizione accettabile per linzio della stagione sono comunque contento per il risultato anche se dobbiamo perfezionare alcuni meccanismi come nel caso del goal subito per una disattenzione difensiva o la traversa che poteva costarci cara perch siamo andati in confusione da bianchi mi aspetto un grosso contributo anche per la capacit di dialogo e dintesa con i compagni del reparto offensivo
7132039 ho visto un buon torino che deve ancora da registrare e perfezioanre la condizione atletica e tattica ma questo normale siamo allinzio della stagione il mercato ancora aperto sia in entrata che in uscita dobbiamo ancora rafforzarci a centrocampo mentre occorrer sfoltire nel reparto offensivo dove ora con larrivo di bianchi abbiamo grande abbondanza senza dubbio di michele incedibile un giocatore fondamentale e rester con noi
7132040 non siamo riusciti a mettere la palla dentro la porta loro con due azioni sono stati bravi a capitalizzare noi purtroppo abbiamo sbagliato tanto sotto porta potevamo fare diversi goal nel complesso non abbiamo fatto male abbiamo disputato una buona partita ci sono mancati i goal perch abbiamo creato tanto loro sono stati bravi a chiuderci ed a non lasciarci tanti spazi cosa che ci ha creato difficolt sono stati bravi in contropiede facendoci due goal il palermo per la partita lha fatta eravamo partiti bene nel primo tempo il goal di cavani era giusto da annullare perch in fuorigioco ma quello di lanzafame era regolare nel primo tempo cera anche un rigore per noi un arbitro esperto come tagliavento non pu non vederlo purtroppo comunque oggi non siamo stati bravi a capitalizzare le tante occasioni avute sotto porta ora rivedremo la partita ed in chiave mercato tireremo le nostre considerazioni sia in entrata che in uscita cavani il goal che ha sbagliato penso che labbia un po condizionato nel rendimento anche se secondo me ha fatto bene poi nel secondo tempo non era facile per nessuno giocare trovandoci sotto di due goal il presidente maurizio zamparini non sar contento ma normale che non lo sia anche perch abbiamo perso contro una squadra di serie c
7132041 abbiamo tanta amarezza la coppa italia per noi era un obiettivo molto importante
7132042 il calcio cos si gioca in 11 contro 11 pu capitare di perdere anche con una squadra di categoria inferiore ora inizia il campionato dobbiamo pensare a questo penso personalmente di potere dare di pi questa stata la prima partita ufficiale mi dispiace che il mio goal non sia servito a niente dobbiamo fare meglio sotto porta abbiamo commesso troppi errori perdendo si formano dei gruppi perch insieme di vedono tutti gli errori commessi e si pu migliorare ora per tutte le partite ognuno di noi dovr dare il massimo
7132043 trovare il gol in queste partite sempre difficile noi siamo partiti molto bene ma nei momenti decisivi abbiamo sempre adottato la soluzione sbagliata li abbiamo bucati tanto anche nel primo tempo ma non abbiamo mai chiuso bene lazione nella ripresa abbiamo operato una grande pressione e alla fine per loro tenere botta fino alla fine non era facile di vaio ha solo bisogno di giocare per trovare lintesa con i compagni se lui sta bene e continua come contro il vicenza non ci sono pi problemi anzi la squadra deve capirlo bene e in fretta perch lunico che va in profondit e sar fondamentale
7132044 e andata pi che bene non potevo immaginare un debutto migliore non semplice inserirsi in un contesto gi ben avviato ma lho fatto con il piede giusto ho fatto gol e sono molto contento ora la cosa importante da fare dialogare bene con i miei compagni e conoscerli sempre meglio alla fine in questa partita ho duettato molto con adailton perch quello che conosco di pi ma lintesa verr con tutti mi sembra che il bologna abbia dimostrato di avere buone basi per puntare alla salvezza che lobiettivo comune ho visto una squadra quadrata che non ha rischiato nulla e che ha cominciato a spingere quando il vicenza rimasto in dieci mancano ancora alcuni automatismi ma normale c tempo per migliorare
7132045 e stata una partita bella divertente ben giocata peccato soltanto per gli infortuni di de silvestri e megni non ci voleva non credo siano di grave entit valuteremo nei prossimi giorni il benevento grande squadra con giocatori di qualit nella ripresa ci hanno messo in difficolt loro erano molto pi brillanti ma la squadra ha reagito con grande autorit devo dire per che queste vittorie non le sento mie sono di delio rossi e della squadra
7132046 questo nuovo ruolo mi piace vedo di pi il gioco mi sto adattando bene devo migliorare ancora tanto sulla fase difensiva lavoro tanto in settimana proprio per migliorarmi in questo purtroppo stasera mi sono procurato una piccola distorsione vedremo in questi giorni come va il ginocchio il gol sono stato fortunato

7132087 most important scheunemanns former lobbying firm orion strategies received at lest 800 000 from the government of georgia between 2004 and may 15 2008 when scheunemann finally severed his ties officially at least to the firm
7132088 before that between january 1 2007 and may 15 2008 scheunemann was officially on the payroll as both georgias lobbyist and mccains top adviser during which time georgia paid orion and 290 000 and mccain paid him 70 000

7132095 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7132096 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7132097 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7132098 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7132099 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7132100 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7132101 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7132102 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7132103 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7132104 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7132105 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items
7132106 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7132107 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7132108 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7132109 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7132110 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7132111 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7132112 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7132113 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7132114 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7132115 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7132116 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7132117 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7132118 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7132119 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7132120 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7132121 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7132122 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7132123 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7132124 who are open to doing something on the production side
7132125 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7132126 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7132127 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7132128 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7132129 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7132130 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7132131 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7132132 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7132133 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7132134 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7132135 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7132136 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7132137 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7132138 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7132139 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7132140 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7132141 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7132142 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7132143 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7132144 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7132145 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7132146 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7132147 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7132148 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7132149 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7132150 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7132151 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7132152 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7132153 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7132154 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7132155 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7132156 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7132157 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7132158 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7132159 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7132160 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7132161 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7132162 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7132163 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7132164 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7132165 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7132166 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7132167 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7132168 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7132169 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7132170 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7132171 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

7132294 the selection of joe biden is a blatant admission that barack obama lacks the experience to be commander in chief just a few months ago sen biden told barack obama the presidency is not the place for on the job training hes right
7132295 hes experienced hes good on foreign affairs hes good on domestic affairs hes what he was looking for
7132296 when you look at sen bidens background hes from a working class background he worked his way up hes a strong family guy
7132297 this is going to be such a positive thing its going to bump sen obama so far that mccain will never catch up
7132298 i think its an excellent excellent selection i think he rounds the ticket he brings the experience the foreign affairs experience i think biden will be well thought of and well respected as vice president

7132314 were part of the reason hes in this historic position hes in now
7132315 i just volunteered to work for the barack obama campaign thats all i did i believe in sen obama and what he stands for and what he is i want to make sure he gets elected
7132316 im sure that theres still people that are disappointed because their candidate is not the nominee but that disappointment can be overcome by a desire to change the country and the recognition that barack obama is the one that can do that
7132317 i am still a supporter of hillary clinton but will work hard to help put a democrat in the white house come january 2009
7132318 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7132319 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7132320 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7132321 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7132322 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7132323 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7132324 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7132325 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7132326 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7132327 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7132328 there are still a lot of little things that we need to improve before next weekend it was good to get them in this type of atmosphere that will help us a lot next weekend
7132329 it was good to finally scrimmage another team after weeks of intrasquad practices
7132330 we found some things that worked and others that we need to work on before the season opening this next weekend
7132331 ok we can do that with commodity hardware and software
7132332 hes a big league pitcher and i wanted him to suit up with the big league team trembley said on his pregame radio show
7132333 it feels great to be back in the tournament where i did really well last year
7132334 i was really close to the title and i had some exhausting matches but this is where i think i felt really confident after that i started believing more that i can win a grand slam title which i did this year
7132335 as a grand slam winner you get some kind of relief and you get motivation to claim even more titles
7132336 i think this surface and the balls and all the conditions here in new york are suitable to my style of the game and to my personality and everything
7132337 so if i feel well physically i think i hope i can get far
7132338 the last couple of weeks for me were really exhausting
7132339 i had to travel all over the world because i went from cincinnati i went back home and then went to beijing and then came here everything in 10 days you can imagine how i feel
7132340 i feel excited about the tournament but physically i still need to work on some things hopefully so that by tuesday wednesday i can be fit
7132341 i dont think im a clear favorite when im playing next to these two guys
7132342 i never have been because theyre of course the first two players in the world next to me there are a lot of players like andy murray who is doing really well the last couple of months we can expect him to play well in this tournament
7132343 but i just want to play the best tennis i can and results will show up
7132344 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7132345 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7132346 dr drew dossett a member of the cowboys medical staff will perform the procedure
7132347 were investigating whether this aircraft had to have 40 flight hours to fly over populated areas while arriving at or departing from an airport
7132348 except for takeoffs and landings this aircraft may not be operated over densely populated areas or in congested airways
7132349 prohibited from operating in congested airways or over densely populated areas unless directed by air traffic control or unless sufficient altitude is maintained to effect a safe emergency landing in the event of a power unit failure without hazard to persons or property on the ground
7132350 it provides propaganda to the taliban and if they dont take responsibility it actually helps the taliban
7132351 coalition forces are aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties
7132352 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
7132353 there is no evidence to show there were taliban there that night
7132354 it is quite obvious the americans bombed the area due to wrong information
7132355 i am 100 percent confident that someone gave the information due to a tribal dispute the americans are foreigners and they do not understand these people they killed were enemies of the taliban
7132356 the global economy is in a tough spot caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere
7132357 the slowdown has reached such a wide range of countries that theyre now feeding on one another
7132358 the u k has been really soft for the last six months
7132359 western europe overall has been flat weve not seen the growth weve seen in the last few years
7132360 the year 2009 in europe is going to look significantly worse than 2008
7132361 it was too hot not to cool down as the song goes
7132362 a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
7132363 its the rest of the world going down not the united states going up
7132364 exports have been sort of holding us out of the graveyard
7132365 that may begin to peter out a little bit if the dollar continues to climb
7132366 if the rest of the world economy slows the demand just isnt going to be there
7132367 when i see the headlines i worry but when i look at my order book i stop worrying
7132368 when china decides they want to build a car somebody runs a steel mill with coal and iron ore out of australia and they mine it with caterpillar dump trucks which are full of timken bearings
7132369 what is driving our success is the globalization of markets
7132370 the global slowdown is going to create some headwind for the united states
7132371 cia has made its own inquiries overseas and no one no individual and no intelligence service has substantiated suskinds account of habbush or the bogus letter
7132372 at this point the origins of the forgery like the whereabouts of habbush himself remain unclear but this much is certain suskind is off the mark
7132373 to state what should be obvious it is not the policy or practice of this agency to violate american law
7132374 it is ridiculous to think that the white house would give me such an order and even more ridiculous to think that i would carry it out
7132375 consistently fought with some administration officials to prevent them from overstating the case for iraqi involvement in international terrorism
7132376 the white house is focusing on this because there may be legal complications for the administration
7132377 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
7132378 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie
7132379 i have enormous respect for warren but i have to disagree
7132380 i have already taken into consideration that the pie is going to grow
7132381 i like to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful an idiot can run them because sooner or later one will
7132382 we need to increase age for full retirement benefits slowly and with warning
7132383 were living longer and were living younger and we need to think about working until 70 rather than retiring at 65
7132384 it introduces risk into a safety net system it is enormously expensive to do and it isnt necessary we can sit down right now and fix it and make social security solvent
7132385 i appreciate his encouragement but i think if i hadnt seen the movie and just listened to him i would think i could ignore the problem a little longer
7132386 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7132387 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7132388 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7132389 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7132390 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7132391 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7132392 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7132393 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7132394 its unfortunate what has happened to the sport and it has to be addressed and it is being addressed
7132395 but if someone wants to believe the only way bolt can do what hes doing is through doping that is their prerogative
7132396 we feel the deterrent effect played a part in what we see
7132397 the athletes know that at this event the ioc which is the organization running the doping programs means business in not having those who cheat as a part of these events
7132398 its unfortunate what has happened to the sport and it has to be addressed and it is being addressed
7132399 but if someone wants to believe the only way bolt can do what hes doing is through doping that is their prerogative

7132404 the uss mcfaul is under way now having taken on humanitarian supplies for the people of georgia
7132405 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
7132406 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
7132407 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
7132408 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7132409 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
7132410 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7132411 wow look at what happened to the trader trash and office whores
7132412 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7132413 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7132414 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7132415 pierrot le fou was an angry accusation against anna karina and a self pitying keen at how she destroyed him and his work
7132416 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7132417 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7132418 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7132419 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7132420 the parthenon had great resilience to earthquakes as did most classical greek temples
7132421 the ancient greeks apparently had very good knowledge of quake behavior and excellent construction quality
7132422 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7132423 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7132424 until now the u s supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7132425 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7132426 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7132427 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7132428 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7132429 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7132430 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7132431 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7132432 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7132433 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7132434 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7132435 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7132436 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7132437 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7132438 my cheeks hurt from smiling my face hurts from the chlorine my legs are sore from jumping up and down
7132439 im in pain and im tired but im so happy
7132440 i thought maybe i could have gotten the bronze or silver medal in my wildest dreams i got the gold medal
7132441 i think the seven golds already proved the strength of the chinese team
7132442 i didnt focus on the points but i knew i had a chance to get the gold
7132443 maybe because i was too eager to have a good performance that last round i made some small mistakes
7132444 i didnt feel that much pressure from the chinese i didnt feel any pressure from anybody
7132445 i was not going to let anything external affect how i was feeling only whats in your mind can affect how you dive
7132446 im happy i was able to pull myself together for the bronze medal
7132447 i went into the competition just wanting to do six good dives
7132448 i knew if i dived well the results would look after themselves look where i am
7132449 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7132450 it is the ppps own decision and it has nothing to do with the coalition
7132451 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7132452 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday

7132472 it was a little strange watching tv broadcast live pictures of the front of your house but thats part of it
7132473 one of the networks they were filming through the window of our house they were filming me in the kitchen making something to eat
7132474 i had given him my word that i would keep it in confidence so i did
7132475 he was very gracious in his call and said that he really appreciated getting to know me and held me in very high regard and wanted very much to work with me going forward both in the campaign and with his administration
7132476 its a bit like going through the political equivalent of a colonoscopy
7132477 they go over everything and anything and track down every crazy rumor and all sorts of stuff but the thing i would like to emphasize is it was an honor
7132478 what really matters is getting our country moving in a better direction
7132479 getting the economy turned around getting us out of iraq in a responsible way ending this dependency we have on imported oil which is so damaging look i like john mccain but i really think hes going to offer us more of the same and i think we need change
7132480 the people camped outside in the front of our house for the last three days i think that reminded everybody of the complete loss of any kind of normal life that you have once something like that happens but look they were up for it
7132481 ill be able to be a better dad and a better senator for the people of indiana and both of those things mean a lot to me
7132482 keep them for the scrap book even though they turned out to be a big head fake
7132483 and i wasnt entirely sure which speech i would be giving
7132484 they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7132485 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7132486 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7132487 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7132488 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7132489 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7132490 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7132491 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7132492 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7132493 musharraf was a curse on our country he was a friend of america and an enemy of islam
7132494 he will be accountable for his crimes in the next world and in this one too i hope he has done the work of the unbeliever and killed so many innocent muslims
7132495 the army is determined to continue with the war against militants but it can only be won with political backing to convince the people that it is their war and not americas
7132496 the system is the same you see new faces in power but nothing more
7132497 the state has failed in pakistan if people want to do anything here they have to do it for themselves
7132498 washington is asking what the hell is going to happen to the war on terror insurgency is like a disease now in pakistan it is spreading outside the tribal areas and the signs are that it is going to be messy for some time to come the concerns are where do we go from here and how do we deal with those guys who are hiding out in pakistan and hitting our soldiers in afghanistan
7132499 the war is on our soil and our boys are dying we will defend our land we are tough on extremism but we need to have democratic wisdom rather than a martial mindset it is in our interest that this war on pakistan is won by us
7132500 so many things have gone wrong but it was demonstrations by the people that got rid of musharraf and that gives our country a new chance
7132501 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel

7132533 id really like to blow you on my knees the boy swallowed hard and the others were shifting around and one of them muttered under his breath fuck this is crazy ding we arrived on 22 and the doors slid open i led the boys down the hall them walking behind me watching my ass as i went they came into my apartment and i told them to just throw their jackets over the table and id get some drinks i actually didnt have too much some wine which had been in the cupboard forever but i did have a bottle of rum and canned coke amp ice they all agreed that rum coke was a good choice and i poured each of them a generous glassful i asked them their names amp ages we chatted a bit about work about school turns out 2 of them recognized me one had delivered pizza to me before and the other a few years earlier had been my paper boy i invited them to sit down 2 boys took their place on the couch 1 in my armchair and the other one well he still looked like he was going to jump out of his skin he stayed near the door holding his drink sipping nervously he actually looked like he expected to have to make an escape at any moment i wished he would relax a bit so i asked them to show me their magazine and i stood in front of them and flipped through it lots of busty models cocks in their asses i found a large close up photo of a cock in a womans mouth with semen running down her cheek i held it up and asked the boys if they liked that particular pic receiving nervous glances and nods in return i went over to one of the boys todd who was sitting on the couch he was the one who had told me i was hot in the elevator and i kneeled down in front of him i rested my forearms on his thighs and undid the button of his jeans i looked up at his handsome young face asked him if he had a hard on and he stammered out yeah show me he didnt move so i helped myself and he didnt stop me i unzipped his fly and could see the bulge in his underwear he was wearing y fronts and they were starting to split open with his cock hardening i slid my hand inside he let out a nervous sigh his cock was so hot to the touch i gently pulled it through his underwear he was semi hard getting harder pink not too big but a nice cock just the same i turned to look at the other boys and ask them if they had a good view and the three of them nodded yes wide eyed i started going down on todds stiffening cock he moaned from between clenched teeth i dont think he had been sucked before the boy who was in my armchair stood up his name was tony and he came over beside us to watch me suck his friends dick the nervous boy by the door deepak edged a little closer but kept his distance the last boy on the couch beside todd well he said his name was jay and he was watching intently as i slid up and down on todds shaft he had the best view i continued to suck todd sometimes taking him deep other times concentrating on giving head i lifted my lips off him for a moment and noticed he was breathing hard and i could taste his precum on my tongue amp lips he was nice and hard now holy fuck jay said keep going suck him off do it dont stop now i instructed jay to open his pants too i mean why not he was right there beside us on the couch i could do two cocks at the same time no problem we all watched as jay fumbled with his button amp fly he couldnt seem to do it while sitting down so i suggested he stand up while he was undressing i kept stroking todds cock lightly with my hand he was super hard now and shiny precum was oozing out of the head jay had taken his shoes and pants off now and was standing there in his boxer shorts with my left hand still stroking todd i reached out with my right and began rubbing jays cock through his silky boxers jays cock felt huge to me under my hand much larger than todd this was going to be good i thought still touching todd i pulled jays boxers down to his thighs wow his cock was gorgeous thick and it sprang forward very impressive veins running all over it i swear i could see them pulsing i put my fingers around his shaft gently and guided him to my mouth jay gasped quietly as i took his head in and began to suck the other boys were still watching us todds cock in my hand jays cock in my mouth tony started opening his pants well i assumed that was what was going on i heard some rustling rustling behind me and a shoe flung across the carpet to the left of me i was too busy blowing jay to turn and look but a moment later his stiff cock was brushing against my cheek and my lips as i sucked jay tony was not shy at all i suspected he was experienced i pulled my head back and jay slipped out of my mouth bobbing up and down in front of me he looked even larger now one of the biggest thickest cocks id seen i could hardly get my mouth open enough to take him all in i turned towards tonys waiting cock which was rubbing my earlobe and hairline gently i opened my mouth to accept him his penis was medium sized very hard and uncut i love uncut cocks unfortunately tony was already near climax at this point in fact i barely got him fully in my mouth before he started spurting his cum a bit of a disappointment for me because i like them to last while i enjoy the sucking and deep throating i wasnt prepared for tony to climax so quickly and choked a bit as i took his load at the back of my throat after about 20 seconds his spasms stopped and i felt his final squirts yeah said jay swallow that sweet cum tonys cock was softening now and i let it slip from my mouth looking up at the boys i swallowed every drop and licked my lips they knew i was ready for more you are so fucking hot jay said todd who i was still stroking lightly with my left hand stammered out that he was going to cum soon he couldnt wait any longer i guess seeing tony blow his wad in my mouth had been a little too much for todd to handle i quickly went down on him my head in his lap tony and jay were encouraging me suck it dry go go go harder suck it harder todd was groaning and thrashing his head from side to side his hands gripped my head and he pushed up into my mouth i finally felt todd squirting his first drops and i lifted my mouth off him but kept it wide open i positioned my wide open mouth at the tip of his cock and started pumping it with my hand sticky gobs of cum started spraying all over my tongue mouth face and in my hair i had to close my eyes not to take any there because that stings he shot quite a bit i was impressed you covered her in it todd was breathing hard and smiling i really think that had been his first time getting a blow job i felt in on my cheeks so i scraped as much as i could onto my fingers and licked them one by one its in your hair jay pointed out i felt some wet globs caught in my hair and was able to suck it off the strands with my mouth jay had been pretty patient up to now he had enjoyed watching me do todd and tonys cocks and giving some instruction but now he announced that it was his turn wait what about deepak i asked indicating the last boy who was still edging away from the action he was obviously uncomfortable deepaks gay tony said abruptly huh said todd from the couch surprised deepak exploded so what shut the fuck up so are you tony youre gay too fuckwad he was pissed off youre gay tony i was surprised considering he had just blown his load in my mouth moments before tony shrugged yeah im gay but im not going to pass up a blow job and i like girls too ive fucked girls ive sucked dicks i dont care as long as i get off interesting i thought to myself he was still standing over where i was kneeling stroking his erect cock no he replied softly not me im not gay but i have nothing against gay guys whatever turns their crank would you let a guy suck your cock i asked him he thought about it and sort of shrugged and then said i dunno im not gay well he didnt say no now did he i decided that it would be a huge turn for me to see deepak the poor stressed boy settle down and relax and suck a nice cock like jays i wanted deepak to join the party deepak i said why dont you come over here and help me with jays cock deepak i could see had a spark of interest in his eyes he had stopped shifting about from foot to foot and was just standing there looking at us his eyes went from me to jays cock in hand i could now also see now that he had bulge in his pants i dont want him sucking my cock you do it like you said you would its my turn suck me its my turn now i looked up at jay and spoke softly listen to me jay you havent lived until youve had 2 mouths doing your cock at the same time trust me it will blow your mind so just tell deepak that its okay with you and well see how it goes i looked to deepak his mouth was open a little like he was breathing through his mouth he looked less nervous and more horny now i got the impression he really wanted to suck his friends cock he was hanging on my every word tell deepak its okay i repeated to jay and youll get your cock sucked by both of us say it jay i insisted say its okay tony and todd chimed in at this point saying do it man go on holy fuck do it do it they were urging jay now they were into it after a long pause and a visible shrinking of his dick in his hand jay finally said okay under his breath but then added quickly that he was not sucking any dicks and that he was not gay i told him not to worry about anything we all knew he was not gay todd and tony both had hard ons again and were stroking their cocks lightly i told todd and tony to keep touching themselves and enjoy the show i added that they should tell me when they were close to cumming and that id try to take their loads in my mouth if i could manage it they got really hot at that suggestion one of them asked to see my tits to this point i was fully dressed black skirt red blouse black nylons black heels so i opened my blouse and pulled it off i was wearing a black lace bra and todd came over to touch me he lifted my tits out of the cups of my bra an touched my nipples softly nice he said jay cleared his throat he seemed stressed out now that his dick was totally soft he wasnt having fun anymore i instructed jay to sit on the couch to relax put his head back he leaned far back into the cushions and spread his legs wide at my urging jays balls were large and hanging down resting on the sofa cushion he was leaning so far back that his ass was tilted up a bit i knew i would have easy access to his asshole if i wanted come on deepak take off your pants i suggested he unzipped his jeans and slid them down his legs kicked off his shoes kicked off his pants he had on boxers and we could all see he had an erection come kneel beside me i told him he came over to me and we both sat together shoulder to shoulder between jays spread legs let me start i said todd and tony gathered close behind us to watch us jays dick was soft he was leaning back and appeared relaxed with his eyes closed i think he was afraid to look at deepak afraid hed bolt if he saw a guy doing him i leaned in and lifted jays cock up with my hand and gave his balls a few long licks i lifted my head and said come on deepak join me deepak leaned in and took a few tentative licks jays cock was starting to stiffen now and he let out a little groan eyes still closed head back hands at his side my turn again deepak pulled back and i moved in for some more licking i took one of jays balls in my mouth and sucked on it gently he was moaning softly eyes closed i let his ball sack slide out of my mouth and asked deepak if he thought he could squeeze in too so we could do jay at the same time without us asking jay spread his legs farther apart and leaned even farther back into the sofa his ass lifted a little more mmm we could smell him deepak and i had now free access to jays balls and we each licked them greedily at same time like we were starving for his ball sack it was like we were competing with each other both our mouths and chins were wet with our saliva and occasionally our tongues would find each other and touch stroking one others tongue and jays balls at the same time todd and tony were encouraging us enjoying the view lick his balls keep licking tony said lick his asshole todd suggested rim him shit get your tongue in there this is so hot i wanna see you do his asshole
7132534 well jerry we just have a super group of guys on the
7132535 i thought we was gonna run out of gas there at the end but i got a nice push from my teammate jerry jeff jeeter mcpheeter racin in the
7132536 i know i did not kill but aid once melissa died im truly truly sorry i ask forgiveness
7132537 theres nothing i can do to bring her back im so sorry
7132538 hes nothing but a murderer the tears are crocodile tears
7132539 did you plea freely and voluntarily given and did you admit to committing second degree murder on melissa james
7132540 i had no idea i was going to react like that but i did im ashamed and sickened by my actions after melissa passed away
7132541 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7132542 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7132543 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7132544 making darn sure i do a good job of completing it
7132545 even today i still read the notes on the internet and things like that and cards and letters that we get from his fellow soldiers
7132546 when i do events like this and i see the community come out and still remember those and support those who gave the ultimate sacrifices as well as those who are currently serving then its not so bad
7132547 part of it is having memories of scott and i running together
7132548 i had heard that it was by far above and beyond other communities
7132549 like taking a spoonful of water out of the pacific ocean
7132550 it doesnt really mean a lot to raise fares because at the end of the day its not an efficient service
7132551 eventually id like to see these monies allocated to something thats successful
7132552 most of these people theyre handicapped not to the extent that theyd take metro mobility but to the extent that they cant walk a couple blocks to the bus
7132553 it has had a huge impact on our driver program just a huge impact
7132554 get more bang for our tax money and maybe even serve more people in the city
7132555 this is going to be a major change no matter how it comes out
7132556 the fact of an african american winning a major partys nomination is unprecedented its a difficult position to be in but so far hes been treading very carefully and i think successfully
7132557 i dont think i know he wants to be elected because hes a good president who happens to be black not because hes black and would like to be president
7132558 after a primary like this theres always more time needed to unify the party
7132559 but obamas going to win the nomination and hes going to make a hell of a speech
7132560 when i hear obama talking about change and a new direction it brings back to me some parallels
7132561 it was part of this whole momentum of moving forward of moving beyond
7132562 i think he has a very tough campaign ahead of him because a lot of ideas about race are very subliminal
7132563 what will they do when they get in the voting booth i dont think anybody really knows yet
7132564 theirs is going to be about history and ours is going to be about the future
7132565 obamas biggest problem is to recapture the excitement about the time he was in minneapolis in february when he was coming on strong
7132566 i think hes better off to just hammer on issues people really do care about it like jobs and the economy
7132567 in the end voters and black voters are more focused on making sure that someone who has their best interests in mind will win rather than voting for the first black president
7132568 i think that obviously ive matured in the sport a lot and obviously this is a mature sponsor in jack daniels
7132569 im excited to be a part of it i enjoyed it when i drove that black car for chip ganassi i just like driving these black cars
7132570 its fun it feels racy i cant wait to get started i think theres a lot of cool things going on
7132571 i am really looking forward to working with all the drivers over there the crew members
7132572 kevin and i grew up in bakersfield together never were real close but obviously theres already an open line of communication there
7132573 and then obviously clint the newest guy besides myself at rcr has obviously had a lot of success and we get along real well so the pieces of the puzzle are there
7132574 if you look at the way things worked out at hendrick we got about halfway through last year and really started coming on
7132575 we started building cars that were the same as the other three and started getting things sorted out and really started coming on and then we had a big change this year
7132576 its been times weve hit it and were real good and times we miss it and we miss it really bad for some reason theres just been a little bit of a miscommunication there
7132577 i think going from crew chief to crew chief car to car sponsor to sponsor team to team its a big adjustment every year
7132578 do not pray for tasks equal to your abilities but pray for abilities equal to your tasks then the performance of your tasks will be no miracle but you will be the miracle
7132579 joe biden ist eine seltene ausnahme jahrzehntelang hat er ver nderung nach washington gebracht aber washington hat ihn nicht ver ndert
7132580 ein f hrer der in der lage ist einzuspringen und pr sident zu sein
7132581 das ist der k mpfer den ich an meiner seite haben will
7132582 biden den wechsel nach washington gebracht ohne dass washington ihn ver ndert hat
7132583 el ex marido la hab a venido a amenazar a la ma ana y ella se fue pero despu s volvi porque hab a mucha gente lo que esper bamos hoy es que no la pusieran a trabajar pero tuvieron que esperar a que pasara esto
7132584 la hab a amenazado varias veces la esperaba afuera y le mandada mensajes
7132585 muy buena muy trabajadora y muy alegre a pesar de tener problemas
7132586 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7132587 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7132588 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7132589 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7132590 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7132591 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7132592 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7132593 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7132594 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7132595 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7132596 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7132597 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7132598 take your travel data and download it to your ds
7132599 the one consistent item that weve seen is that all the fires are being set by the roadside
7132600 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
7132601 we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
7132602 a m lo que me da tristeza es que se hayan dejado corromper eso es muy grave y me siento frustrado
7132603 yo pregunto con el respeto a su independencia de la fiscal a si se conocieron esos hechos desde hace a o y medio por qu no se tomaron decisiones por qu me dejaron a m botar corriente en los consejos de seguridad pedirles ayuda a los fiscales que no nos iban a apoyar porque estaban protegiendo a la delincuencia
7132604 when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace
7132605 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
7132606 have a duty to protest the legal recognition of homosexual partnerships
7132607 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7132608 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7132609 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7132610 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7132611 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
7132612 female empowerment are they missing by going to church especially now that they can be bishops or is it that they dont like not being more powerful than god this just sounds like another plea for the church to become the culture thanks weve been trying that its not working well
7132613 its okay it wasnt your fault these things just happen
7132614 shes right under developed lungs and suffocation it couldve happened to anyone
7132615 the kids have been born but thats the last time i was updated
7132616 of course mello well be right outside the room alright
7132617 damn why does this hospital have to be so big
7132618 excuse me do you know where mello keeh jeevas is
7132619 i know where he is though he thinks youll hate him if you speak to him i dont think you remeber me from the la area
7132620 i dont know many people in my area my apologies what is your name
7132621 its nice to see you found your friend oh how silly of me mello is inside
7132622 youre daughter thats it the other one he didnt make it
7132623 why else would it happen to me to us i turned by back on god and now he takes his revenge
7132624 if it couldve happened to anyone then whyd it happen to me
7132625 because he wasnt ment to be born if he was hed be here right now
7132626 why not what did he do in his two minutes of living to deserve death
7132627 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
7132628 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7132629 it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and played so well on all surfaces
7132630 i would think it does reduce the pressure five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered so maybe now it changes a little bit
7132631 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7132632 rafa has played great so he deserves the number one position hes in a way the favourite now all of a sudden even on hard courts because hes played so so well
7132633 when you want to win the goal is the same and the pressure is the same
7132634 i am not thinking that i am number one or number two i have been happy being number two for the last three years
7132635 i know how tough it is to be number one and i know i can just as easily slip back to number two or number three
7132636 i have to try to enjoy this moment and accept it because i am not always going to play like i did the last six months right now i am having the best moment of my career
7132637 the last couple of weeks for me were really exhausting
7132638 i had to travel all over the world because i went from cincinnati i went back home and then went to beijing and then came here everything in 10 days you can imagine how i feel
7132639 anytime something happens we try to do something to make it safer and better
7132640 its always a hairy situation if its an explosion a man under a train theres a gas leak theres a woman in a wheelchair with a broken elevator and we carry her up
7132641 the can do attitude has enabled the f d n y to protect life and property at a superior level of excellence since the fire departments inception
7132642 she never got to see our baby but she was in love with him
7132643 i hope he really does rot in hell i hope he dies a horrible death
7132644 i have asked that secretary of veterans affairs the honorable james b peake investigate the potential of establishing a greater va presence on the island possibly to assist with claims processing as well as training of our local vso volunteers i am confident that the trip will help the staff inform chairman bob filner of california and subcommittee chairman john hall of new york about the importance of a greater va presence on guam i will continue to make every effort to ensure that our veterans are provided with the very best service possible on guam the new majority in congress has increased funding for the va to improve the claims processing system its important that guam also benefit from those additional resources
7132645 its nice for the veterans to see all different types of dogs
7132646 a lot of the veterans have increased their socialization and communication when the dogs are around
7132647 having them here makes for a more home like environment
7132648 and its nice to see their faces when they see the dogs coming
7132649 to bring a little cheer and happiness to the veterans
7132650 how can i expect her to stay with me anymore
7132651 shes not going to want to be intimate with a freak elephant man thats the way i saw myself
7132652 combined with the fact that returning vets are usually older and partnered this is having a devastating effect on relationships
7132653 the man will say i dont even feel like having sex anymore he has been conditioned to not feel emotions and may experience hypervigilance or anxiety when touched emotional detachment is a hallmark of ptsd
7132654 the first time you see the reflection of your changed body whether sitting in a wheel chair or severely disfigured because of facial burns it is shocking people who are not married look down and ask will anyone ever be interested in me if they are married they wonder will my partner still find me sexually attractive facing issues of body image and sexual self esteem are pretty universal
7132655 i knew that i definitely wanted to have more children and i knew that he was not interested in me and so a big red flag to me was well what did i do why does he not want to have sex why does he not want to touch my hand or why is he not asking me to get in the bed am i the only one that is feeling like i want in the bed
7132656 he had dreams that he didnt realize he was having
7132657 he was much more active during these dreams nothing that would keep me up but yes there was a part of him he couldnt control
7132658 this war can result in separate bedrooms and sexless loveless marriages 25 years down the road
7132659 many couples are resilient and their relationships last or may even be strengthened
7132660 one woman sends her husband to the bunker in the basement
7132661 its inadvertently sending a message that he cant handle it
7132662 i was good looking before and im better looking now
7132663 it derives out of low self esteem suddenly theres an element of respect he didnt have before
7132664 i went out there and took pictures of the car and said that son of a
7132665 no one in our chapter has a maroon 2001 chevy
7132666 they came to us and we were like holy cow
7132667 as a final warning we send out a letter saying we dont want to cancel the plates or notify the fbi
7132668 we dont want to make so many hoops to jump through that people who deserve it cant get a license plate
7132669 thats ridiculous that txdot would have to go to a private individual
7132670 the only other option would be to not issue any military license plates and that would be a real travesty
7132671 although the idea of establishing such a database is noble the creation of an accurate and complete historical database with name and citation of all past valorous award recipients is unattainable and cost prohibitive
7132672 suddenly theres an element of respect he didnt have before
7132673 when i think about him and were fighting together and im a bloody mess
7132674 when i think about the soldiers who have died for our country it just bothers me
7132675 we certainly dont want to see them hurt in any way
7132676 if there are proper authorities to turn this over to well certainly do that
7132677 im almost at a loss for words that this could happen in the united states of america
7132678 they have more rights in russia than they have here
7132679 he started this about six months after he came to the colony
7132680 we used to be pretty good friends but he allied himself with what i consider to be a group of dissidents
7132681 were things that occurred four or five years ago and have been resolved
7132682 i wont say i know him as trev but dan is welcome to be the us attorney general now
7132683 evaluate these aphorisms and assess them in accordance to the tone of your thoughts
7132684 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7132685 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquires but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7132686 once we get information where they are we will take measures be it force or negotiations we will try to ensure the safety and release of the journalists
7132687 consular officials are in contact with local authorities in an attempt to confirm these reports
7132688 als je het niet voor jezelf doet doe het dan voor mij
7132689 typisch dat juist de mensen die het hardst achter deze persoon aanrennen een nederlands hanteren wat mij het plaatsvervangend schaamrood op de kaken doet stijgen
7132690 i presume he was sucked down into it and he was overcome by the rush of waters
7132691 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7132692 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it doesnt worry us much
7132693 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7132694 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather

7132770 the wonderful thing about a steam engine is that you can follow the path of power generation and function beginning with the fire box and boiler follow the plumbing valves gauges gears d valves pistons eccentric shafts and fly wheels all the way from the source of power to the final outcome of kinetic potential
7132771 in all of the new steampunk design there is a strong nostalgia for a time when technology was mysterious and yet had a real mark of the craftsperson burnished into it
7132772 handicraft almost completely vanished the unity of design and production ended

7132780 i love my mac i worship at the feet of steve jobs anyone who would sully the perfect design that is

7132783 i guess cory is right any and all criticism of steampunk is legitimate no matter how ham handed inaccurate or contradictory and any problem with those critiques whether with the conclusions or the specifics is evidence of arrogance and self importance thanks cory
7132784 i agree with you that steampunk is full of arrogance and self importance and i would add elitism judgmentalism materialism and a high handed unflattering contempt for the common man
7132785 besides its not the victorian era its kitch you worship diyers brass leather and wood are so boring why dont you dare to try some art nouveau asthetics is it too difficult
7132786 opinions are like anal orifices everyone has one and they usually stink
7132787 if its not broke it doesnt have enough useless features
7132788 btw i tend to preferr art deco to art noveau and incorporate much of the former in my own steampunk creations
7132789 cory you remind me all too much of certain people whom i absolutely detested in the electronic music scene to whit the kinds who would visciously attack anyone who dared call a song breakbeat techno when it was obvious to everyone that it was actually happy hardcore or vice versa when i couldnt give 2 cents difference between the two styles

7132796 i think that alot of the comments here are slamming the article for missing the point of steampunk but in turn have missed the point of the article as near as i can tell the central critique of steampunk in this article is that he doesnt like form being valued over function
7132797 despite your claims your telephone mods have nothing to do with art nouveau or art deco plus they are not steampunk at all dieselpunk at best so i cant see why youve decided to show them here
7132798 people like this stuff and i dont understand it therefore i must tear it down
7132799 another fantasy to consider a world which isnt addicted to the evermore expensive oil industry
7132800 where do people get this idea that we all arrange huge hatefests where we burn ipods in effigy and self importantly expound at length about how were going to change the world through cultural revolution
7132801 imagine if you are capable if your infantile comprehension can fathom the concept a world in which the everyday item is asthetically pleasing in its function as well as durable enough to stand the tests of time rather than being slated for the recycle bin or rubbish heap after a very short lifespan another fantasy to consider a world which isnt addicted to the evermore expensive oil industry such a thing of beauty unfortunately for us would neither be easily mass produced nor would it be in the benefit of the rich capitalistic monopolists who strive only to make that next million dollars verily it is easier to mock a dreamer than to share the dream

7132820 inside my heart i visualize ever increasing waves of light which eventually come closer and closer together until it is a mass of white light energy when i am ready i open my arms and aim the energies that have built up to my beloved twin flame as i open my arms i then draw them back to me as if embracing her in a hug how it expanded this time as i did it i was asked to slow the image down so that i could observe what was happening before it gets to her this time i repeated the ritual and i watched the waves of energy as they left my heart i saw them moving out into the universe and what i then saw surprised and amazed me at the same time i could see multitudes of beings absorbing these waves this loving embrace and it was being received in joy and magnified multiplied before it was being sent out first of all it was being sent to mother earth and as she absorbed it she sent it out to her surface offering it to all beings upon her it then reflected back out into a multitude of universes i was dumbstruck at the beauty of what was unfolding in my hearts eye i had tears of love and gratitude rolling down my face as the enormity and the results of this simple little hug had created
7132821 without spilling drinking tipping or sipping there is no room for now to fill you up

7132823 sudden transitions hold the key to a deep question about how nature works of equal interest to scientists and philosophers alike how does order emerge from disorder right at the transition point the system is poised to choose between these two phases like a climber on a crest choosing which side to go down undecided which way to go the system frequently goes back and forth its vacillations increasing near the critical point in the vicinity of the critical point we need to stop viewing atoms separately rather they should be considered communities that act in unison atoms must be replaced by boxes of atoms such that within each box all atoms behave as one
7132824 god goddess divine spirit of all there is we thank you for this opportunity to gather together in one anothers company we thank you for the light you bring to this family gathering please grant us the vision to see the highest in one another and grant us the opportunity to continue to be there for each other in good times as well as not so great times give us strength and fortitude to ride the tides of change and empower us always to be nurturing and loving with one another open our spiritual eyes that we may see one another for who we truly are and love one other in the same spirit may sadness disappointment and anger be minimal may happiness positive thoughts and good experiences together be bountiful may we always cope and hope with each other with grace

7132846 i was not as good a boss as i could have been
7132847 she was just sort of handed an empty plate and told to go forth and make it happen
7132848 im disappointed that she took that route on her way out the door

7132859 but for every one of those ive had thousands of thank you for showing the world the real mexico
7132860 somehow people think that if youre raised by a family of a certain culture youll have a mastery itll be in your genes and thats not always true
7132861 and in a sense thats such a small part of it
7132862 for instance if you want to write about mole as a mexican you are obliged to say your grandmothers recipe is the only one thats the best and if you were to go to another town and say that mole is better than my grandmothers youd get run out of town on a rail but its not a problem for me because i dont have that mexican grandmother i can embrace all of mexico all the regions all the styles and bring it all together in one place
7132863 i can say i reach a lot of people that dont see eye to eye with me politically socially or anything yet when were at the table cooking an incredible paella over a wood fire we have the most amazing time all of a sudden all the differences fall away
7132864 i can bring people to the table with really beautifully crafted food as our country becomes more and more latino i think a real mexican table is really going to be an important step in sort of bringing the cultures together i cant help but think it will influence others to look at what mexican culture has done
7132865 the type of people who get in to stories are those who truly help stories move along have a particular knowledge and expertise
7132866 first you have to do your homework you have to learn the history
7132867 this is just how my mother makes it that doesnt make a story this is how it was created in this part of veracruz and it was made this way with that from there is the story
7132868 but its also really the flavors you have to be a good cook you gotta do all the rest of the work and have a good personal story and tell a good story about the food and you have to have inherent passion for what youre making
7132869 people love to be around passion its very important to talk about the food with this great verve

7132881 the selection of joe biden is a blatant admission that barack obama lacks the experience to be commander in chief just a few months ago sen biden told barack obama the presidency is not the place for on the job training hes right
7132882 hes experienced hes good on foreign affairs hes good on domestic affairs hes what he was looking for
7132883 when you look at sen bidens background hes from a working class background he worked his way up hes a strong family guy
7132884 this is going to be such a positive thing its going to bump sen obama so far that mccain will never catch up
7132885 i think its an excellent excellent selection i think he rounds the ticket he brings the experience the foreign affairs experience i think biden will be well thought of and well respected as vice president

7132891 they provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might have otherwise gone without
7132892 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7132893 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7132894 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7132895 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7132896 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bush
7132897 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7132898 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7132899 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7132900 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7132901 i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people and who will always put their dreams first a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world with our security and standing set back by eight years of a failed foreign policy a leader who shares my vision of an open government that calls all citizens democrats republicans and independents to a common purpose above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7132902 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7132903 the next president vice president of the united states joe biden
7132904 well its great to be here on the steps of the old state house in the land of lincoln president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place then stand firm
7132905 im told i talk too colloquially but theres something about this guy theres something about this guy theres something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together like no one i have worked with and seen theres something about barack obama that makes people understand if they make compromises they can make things better
7132906 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so once so deplored of giving in to the right wing of his party
7132907 the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7132908 your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7132909 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7132910 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7132911 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7132912 we use it on a regular basis weve used it in the past and well continue to use it
7132913 it does help us to tackle some of the kerb crawling issues but we also use high visibility patrols

7132928 our nation has a modern missile that can launch the second stage missile 250 km 150 miles into space the second stage is a smaller missile carrying the satellite which has very complex technical equipment
7132929 massachusetts institute of technology professor daniel nocera and his mit colleague matthew kanan have published a technical paper that describes what they claim is a breakthrough in solar energy storage

7132947 that infamous kitchen disturbance n555champ was cleared up by you a most original case and we cannot forget the mass rock dude s efforts with that extremely trying amp twisting narritive very well done
7132948 the most surprising case i saw was spun by a certain mighty joe young this one certainly caught me off guard if im not mistaken hes puttering right by this very window on a moped one of a rather shocking shade of pink i must say
7132949 while we continue to seek large non recurrent sales like the sale to the u s army we believe that the continued growth in our core business is critical to our success we are pleased that our core business has continued to grow even in a difficult environment we continue to believe that our efforts in introducing new products will begin to bear fruit in the fourth quarter of this year
7132950 hey love did you know youre being crazy god youre insane
7132951 his objectivity covering the presidential race continues to look shaky we learned not too long ago that fournier exchanged emails with karl rove about pat tillman and fournier was also one of the journalists who at a gathering of the nations newspaper editors extended mccain a box of his favorite donuts with sprinkles
7132952 action tell ap to remove ron fournier from the presidential beat as recently as last year ron fournier considered working for the mccain campaign instead he took a job as washington bureau chief for the ap but it looks like hes still working for mccain its time to crank out letters to the editor again ron fournier must be taken off the presidential beat hes got an obvious conflict of interest
7132953 why oh why cant we have a better press corps dont trust them dont patronize their advertisers dont believe them listen instead to people with substantive expertise and knowledge trying to convey that knowledge rather than the ignorant trying to score points with their owners editors and sources
7132954 if pure republican spin and mccain talking points are what we are to expect out of the ap under fournier its going to be a long hard slog full of truth squading between now and election day
7132955 i know that the associated press considers it a point of honor to promote someone whenever they do something incredibly biased and their impartiality is seriously compromised but after their top presidential reporter ron fournier interviewed for a job with the mccain presidential campaign its simply abominable that ap would keep him on the presidential beat
7132956 ive never responded to so many calls e mails and inquiries
7132957 every four years theres always a big boom everyone gets that olympic fever
7132958 they see their kids watching the olympics on tv and say hey lets get them to do that

7132962 a lot of people are signing up for more than one class that doesnt normally happen
7132963 were excited about the possibility of raising more money to help more women
7132964 if you are dealing with foreclosures boarded up properties there is not as much interest as there is with model homes
7132965 it creates a lot of interest because its so drastically below market value everyone is focused on these properties because everyone wants a deal
7132966 builders hope to sell five to 10 units per month but can drop down to one a month when the market slows
7132967 the auctions generate enough interest to allow the builder to accelerate the process to 30 in a one day event
7132968 it depends on the auction whats happening with marketing and what other people are doing in the market

7133036 databases of individuals identifying information stored on laptops are prime targets for identity thieves who recognize the exceptional value of such records
7133037 employment data is in fact tailor made for fraudsters and every potential victim is also a potential plaintiff in a potential class action suit against any offending organization that leaves identifying information on its mobile computers the alternative is simple equip mobile computing fleets with affordable laptop tracking capability and remote data retrieval and deletion technology
7133038 no reason to believe that the information has been or will be used improperly
7133039 when a laptop computer storing confidential data on employees goes missing from a business office the default assumption ought to be that the data is also at risk
7133040 the default practice for organizations in fact should be to raise the odds of sparing the data from this risk by installing laptop tracking technology on their fleets of mobile computing equipment
7133041 we had procedures in place to help secure the machines but we realized that we needed some key additional layers of security such as covert tracking and remote controlled data recovery and destruction mylaptopgps solution is very easy to use and we are quite satisfied we would recommend mylaptopgps to any business seeking a simple solution to secure their laptops and data

7133055 it helps with balance coordination and movement so we use it with a variety of patients
7133056 it doesnt have to be boring it doesnt have to be hard and grueling its fun to bring in the games and make it fun
7133057 i will appear personally at the fa hearing if required definitely
7133058 i did it at court so why am i not going to do it at the fa if you support someone you support them
7133059 as long as he doesnt let me or this club down again he has support from me i know a lot of people dont agree but it is for me to decide
7133060 if he capello is going to play the shape when hes got players coming from midfield and needs somebody who will bring other players into the game then he should look at dean
7133061 hes a top player and if he wants to go then fair enough but first of all a deal has got to be struck between the two clubs
7133062 tottenham want the best deal for themselves theyre not going to take 20m for berbatov
7133063 ill take whatever punishment but i thought the referees first half performance was abysmal
7133064 we would not have got this result last season we just wouldnt accept we were going to get beat we must aim to do that every week
7133065 we want to help more people to participate to break out of the stadium experience to extend and share the sense of theatre
7133066 its so different than when youre the rabbit tonight i chased i knew what i wanted to do for my team
7133067 i thought wed have a lead before i got the stick and when i saw the russian team ahead of us it really pumped me up and i was excited to go for it

7133070 the first night i probably slept for 30 minutes because i couldnt stop thinking about it
7133071 i actually went and stayed with my family i thought it was the best place for me to be and we started talking about other things and they tried to help me forget about the race its hard after working for four years and coming up short i dont think that memory will go away overnight so i think about it a lot but at least now i have something positive to think about as well
7133072 as an athlete i tried to concentrate on the competition
7133073 i finally was able to talk to them and i found out they were safe
7133074 its more that they feel that im american it doesnt matter where i was born
7133075 im truly very proud to be an american and most definitely very proud to be on the u s team
7133076 but i know georgia has very good relations with other countries and the world is not blind and will not just stand by

7133079 china has successfully used the games to win glory and respect
7133080 for the last 100 years china has tried to find a new national identity and the olympics is the high point of that search
7133081 we knew wed be the underdog and china would have the home field advantage
7133082 the key with any host country is whether they maintain momentum as long as they invest huge resources in sports theyll have a great pipeline of athletes
7133083 lius withdrawal will provoke discussion about whether he was pushed too hard or put under too much pressure
7133084 well have 12 15 18 members of teams wearing medals but the medal table only shows one
7133085 with both their resources and effort in every single sport were going to have to redouble our effort
7133086 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
7133087 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses
7133088 whether the cat is black or white makes no difference as long as it catches mice it is a good cat

7133093 chinese people condemned and protested against five foreigners for formenting tibetan independence at tiananmen square yesterday noon
7133094 these games have been fantastic for prominent powerful impressive women who are role models who will empower and appeal to girls
7133095 this is always the point in the sporting calendar where we really focus on successful sportswomen and if we are serious about having an active nation then we need a culture change with the media giving much more attention to womens and girls sport
7133096 lets broadcast successful womens sports across the board and give young girls and young women much more positive role models
7133097 theres a kind of culture of girls in pe where they just try to avoid it
7133098 its not considered cool and girls dont see a future in it so they think its a bit of a waste of time thats because they dont have role models to look up to
7133099 the male part of the gb team has done so well for a few years and its really nice that we now have females in the team who are really performing at the highest level and showing they can be just as competitive determined and successful as their male counterparts

7133101 corn power might be cheaper as long as they continue subsidizing it but if it did work they wouldnt need to subsidize it
7133102 if the bass is finally to produce a headliner the instrument can have no better champion
7133103 go back six months and think about all the people who were saying we couldnt finish fourth in the table we couldnt finish third because that would mean dislodging russia but now theres a chance that we will
7133104 it shows the simplicity of a lot of thinking conventional wisdom dictated that there was no point going for third place in the medal table because it wasnt possible well perhaps it is and were going to do it
7133105 that leads to complacency and making mistakes what i like to have is the confidence that i will get to the start line best prepared best trained and best coached without any last minute worries it then becomes exciting because it is your moment to shine your reward for all the hard work you and all the back up staff have put in i love the training the satisfaction at the end of a hard session that i have taken one small step to an overall goal you have to have motivation and there can be no greater motivation for me than to get gold in london
7133106 i have had so many messages and things to do that it hasnt sunk in yet but i am really looking forward to getting home to mansfield no doubt it will be crazy for a few days but i am so looking forward to seeing all my family and my boyfriend and taking the holiday that we have planned from day one i wont be back into the pool until september
7133107 this is the best british team i have seen by a long way and it is just getting better and better because we have done amazing things people are taking more interest and that should get us more support and better facilities to make london 2012 the best experience of all
7133108 its never easy getting up at five in the morning but it is just something you have to do to achieve what i have swimming for two hours doing some gym or something in the day and then another two hours in the evening is the programme i have done with bill furness and when i get back i am not planning to change anything

7133125 we need to help these countries develop sophisticated air defence and anti tank capabilities that dont pose any offensive threat to russia but promise the possibility of very high casualties were they to attempt what they did in georgia
7133126 nato has to make a fundamental decision here about its legal and ethical obligations and the only way we can really fulfil them is to help these countries defend themselves in advance of an attack
7133127 i think that russia does have designs on the baltic states and they have established a precedent in georgia where they think they can use force to defend russian minorities in other countries
7133128 the whole purpose of nato is to deter war and only secondly to fight if war breaks out the russians knew that georgia would be easy but i would like them to know that somewhere like estonia would be very hard
7133129 i dont know that anybody specifically backs it but i think it is a likely subject for consideration
7133130 i doubt that even the most hot headed russian general would attack a nato country
7133131 the baltic states are certainly conveying privately if not publicly what they need if i had to put money i would say this is what we will have to do as the risks involved are huge are we prepared to have the russians tell us that we cannot offer assistance and give them a veto over what we can offer
7133132 had lithuania or estonia been the target of the recent russian campaign they would have been in a position to take ground in a very similar way to how they did in georgia

7133139 im looking for us to progress every season and this is the first summer when ive felt we havent it is the most frustrating time ive had as manager and you can see its not helping out on the pitch
7133140 of course the disappointment is affecting the players they are not daft my job is not to let them down and i feel i am doing that by not bringing reinforcements in for this team to win any premier league game at the moment is a major achievement
7133141 very few clubs want to sell its not a matter of failing to agree prices or personal terms i just cant get the players of the quality that will improve us
7133142 our defence was the reason we got the result west brom are entitled to feel they should have got something from the game but the premier league is a cruel place and youve got to win when youve got the opportunity we hung in there and took advantage when they couldnt score
7133143 evertons style is pragmatic they took their chances and we didnt i know football is results driven but i cant complain about that performance we set the tempo and controlled the game can we score enough goals yes i think we can if we play like that every week well be fine

7133149 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7133150 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7133151 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7133152 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7133153 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7133164 with our nation at war our economy in recession we know the american people can not afford four more years of the same old policies and the same old politics we know that a time for change has come
7133165 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7133166 its not a problem john mccain has hell have to decide which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7133167 we believe our tomorrows will be better than our yesterdays that literally has been the american way and it will be that way again but theres a missing piece and that piece is leadership
7133168 these times require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change we need

7133170 you learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him
7133171 ladies and gentleman no one knows better than i do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre challenged every single day ive watched barack obama face it with steel in his spine
7133172 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7133173 committing record amounts of time money and energy this election to educate voters about john mccains anti worker agenda and elect barack obama and joe biden and a pro worker majority in congress
7133174 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7133175 when its time for straight answers clear conviction and decisive action
7133176 should be a grave concern to reasonable people of good will on both sides of this issue
7133177 all organisations operate within the broader society and the natural environment what an organisation can and cannot do in terms of its strategy is not only constrained by legislation government policies and regulatory requirements but also by what is considered ethical and in accordance with the expectations of stakeholder and societal standards
7133178 in my experience senior management now realises that the proper management of the communication function can make a strategic difference to the triple bottom line to illustrate how open senior management in south africa is to the fact that our discipline can make a difference the king report iii on corporate governance in sa due to appear in january 2009 will have a separate chapter on stakeholder relationship management my direct involvement with the writing of the report has led to senior managers realising that a proactive approach to managing relationships and communication is much better than a reactive one although changing the perceptions of senior management about the strategic role of the communication function in the organisation is a slow process communication managers in south africa can now go to the c suite with a document that will back up the validity of their discipline in business in general after many years the results of the excellence study have paid off handsomely in practice with the shared expectations between senior management and the communication function now being enshrined in the king report iii in a chapter on stakeholder relationship management
7133179 i commend our new attorney general and her staff for the courage fortitude and heart theyve shown in their recent efforts shutting down illegal gambling machines on guam

7133181 we can build another one but its not the same horse its not the same wood that mike picked
7133182 i called him sometime after that and said mike why cant i just take your horse the pieces that you already have and let me finish it up which i did and i think i worked on it two weeks to the day
7133183 bob had done just a marvelous job fitting all the pieces and doing all the intricate details so it was really a special project
7133184 when the spraying was all done they were carrying their equipment into back into the store and in the meantime when it was unattended in a minutes time someone walked off with it
7133185 to see something like this happen to something that meant so much to bob and i it hurts it really hurts not so much of the theft but because of who it was for
7133186 bring it back leave it here no questions asked we just want it back we dont care who took it at this point the important thing is for us to have it to deliver to mike as soon as we can get it back

7133217 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
7133218 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
7133219 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
7133220 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
7133221 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
7133222 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic

7133226 phew lucky its lunch time even though my karate is beyond a black belt but i wouldnt want to face her wrath dang her glare really scared the shit out of me
7133227 who is this girl ive never seen her before maybe shes a transferred student but shes really handsome and she has pants too
7133228 out of the way cant you see rika sama is here idiot
7133229 erika we have to teach these idiots a lesson not to get in way

7133231 who am i is none of your business even my father wouldnt dare to lecture me that

7133233 really next time you should stand up against them bullies are coward once you fight against them

7133235 thats why you didnt know about rikas strong background avoid her next time when you see her im going back to my classroom thank you for saving me and im sorry for putting you in danger she might not leave you alone

7133238 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7133239 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7133240 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7133241 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7133242 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7133243 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day

7133269 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7133270 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7133271 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7133272 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him

7133297 it feels great to be back in the tournament where i did really well last year
7133298 i was really close to the title and i had some exhausting matches but this is where i think i felt really confident after that i started believing more that i can win a grand slam title which i did this year
7133299 as a grand slam winner you get some kind of relief and you get motivation to claim even more titles
7133300 i think this surface and the balls and all the conditions here in new york are suitable to my style of the game and to my personality and everything
7133301 so if i feel well physically i think i hope i can get far
7133302 the last couple of weeks for me were really exhausting
7133303 i had to travel all over the world because i went from cincinnati i went back home and then went to beijing and then came here everything in 10 days you can imagine how i feel
7133304 i feel excited about the tournament but physically i still need to work on some things hopefully so that by tuesday wednesday i can be fit
7133305 i dont think im a clear favorite when im playing next to these two guys
7133306 i never have been because theyre of course the first two players in the world next to me there are a lot of players like

7133324 a wiki is one of the most versatile tools you can use but what keeps people coming back is its simplicity in a very short time people can learn how to use the wiki and put any one of these examples into practice once they do so they will wonder how they got along without it

7133337 we believe these rankings are misleading and do not serve the interests of the prospective students because its based partially on the opinion of reputation and not fully on the results of schools and their graduates
7133338 basically the entire instrument is set up to penalize schools who have students of color who have nontraditional students who have first generation students and who have economically poor students
7133339 any school that has a large proportion of those is not in the top tier
7133340 you have more schools on the east coast and if theyre more familiar with the east coast schools then those get higher rankings than schools in arkansas like hendrix and philander smith

7133359 this is my way of sharing my income to the local government this is where my csr corporate social responsibility is implemented i want to do it in my town
7133360 modesty aside i think i have contributed a lot to the towns development without even running for an elective office i just help i talk to our local officials that they should do their jobs properly and think of their constituents
7133361 ive always been helping my mother in her business so from my elementary to high school years during breaks i was always with my mother watching the store helping sell goods and sometimes even as a gasoline boy
7133362 it was hard work it was not easy it really required a lot of focus a lot of perseverance a lot of patience and of course sometimes you need a blessing from up there you need the luck and the breaks maybe i was at the right place at the right time
7133363 i think my turning point was in indonesia when i said that i wanted to be a millionaire at that time before reaching the age of 30 and the turning point was when we were able to get a concession agreement in timber operations in 1977 thats where i started realizing big bucks
7133364 when doing government projects in indonesia was already very difficult
7133365 that was the time when all the businesses in indonesia were all cornered by the children of the president suharto
7133366 so what did i tell myself i will convince the daughter of suharto to invest in the philippines and i will be the local partner and it happened thats the skyway so if you cannot fight them in their own country bring them to your own country then you become the local ally
7133367 if you have a plan and you have achieved it that means you are within your targets

7133370 my work ethic is basically based on fairness transparency and good governance and as a manager i rely on human resources i think you should treat your people fairly and squarely and reward them properly once they are successful
7133371 stick to your business plans be focused and dont give up things dont happen overnight it takes time

7133562 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn police that the letters were a hoax however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in fabricating the confession and conviction of humble
7133563 the hoaxer stitch up of john humble and the corrupt policeman responsible
7133564 i would appeal to anyone who has seen a watch or phone like beckys to come forward
7133565 my team has focused on a large number of suspects over a very short period of time

7133570 do you know anyone who wears one of these watches or have you found a watch or been sold a watch like it
7133571 even if someone has innocently bought a south park watch or has been given one as a gift from someone it is important they contact us in confidence
7133572 it may have been found or handed to someone but it could link back to becky and it is important that we trace her missing watch
7133573 the other only major outstanding feature of the yorkshire ripper investigation remains the identity of the man with the geordie accent who sent george oldfield the infamous letters and tape in 1999 during the production of the itv documentary manhunt the search for the yorkshire ripper a request was made by the production team to west yorkshire police for facilities to film a dna test being made on the envelopes the letters and tape came in it would have been a way of showing the great changes the police had made in the detection of crime the intention was to see if the dna matched any of the profiles held in the then fledgling national dna database if it did not then dna from the envelopes from the gum on theflap or from the stamp the sender would have licked could be registered on the database of crime scene profiles if the person who sent the tapes was arrested for a reportable crime in the future then the police could identify him forensic scientists had already shown he was a blood group b secretor a dna analysis from traces of saliva could have nailed him and brought him to book charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice it was not to be several months after the initial inquiry the somewhat embarrassed response came back sorry weve lost the envelopes and there is no reasonable hope of us finding them the hoaxer has never been traced and probably never will be

7133595 i was rushing through my delivery not a good tempo when i did get the groundballs that i needed they werent at people it just wasnt my day basically everything you dont want to do i did today
7133596 today he just seemed a little flat up in the zone
7133597 he made some mistakes and on top of that it seemed like every ball found a hole
7133598 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7133599 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it
7133600 they scored runs for him early and he filled up the strike zone which is what youre supposed to do when you have a lead
7133601 a lot of the time especially at this time of the year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time
7133602 but as ive said for a long time records are meant to be broken i certainly thought that by this time someone would have won it twice
7133603 i thought that the way he ran a year ago was extremely impressive i thought maybe he should have gotten some consideration even last year
7133604 its an honor and a blessing to even be mentioned in the same sentence with the heisman trophy
7133605 for guys like archie to say something like that thats incredible
7133606 tim tebow is the type of guy who works hard im sure hes working his butt off to get a second one
7133607 i dont know im not worried about that its a great personal accomplishment but my motivation is one reason and one reason only and thats to get to the playoffs and win the world series
7133608 i will take 15 wins and a world series and id be the happiest player in baseball
7133609 it was as hot today as it was in florida at least as humid it was sticky out there
7133610 but i felt like i got stronger as the game went on i was able to maintain myself
7133611 outside of brandon webb there arent too many people pitching better than he is
7133612 i know he set a personal best but he is not satisfied he is one of those guys that has busted his tail to put himself in this position hes been just unbelievable for us
7133613 i didnt have it today when i got to the ballpark i started feeling weird in my stomach

7133624 you see a lot less old school hardnosed my way or the highway coaching because players now are just different than they were when my father started out
7133625 thats what monte kiffin says coaching back then players just wanted to play they just loved playing football now so much more goes into it and they make so much money that you have to find different ways to motivate them the two things that motivate them are playing time and money
7133626 if you can get them better theyre gonna listen because that gets them to play more so they can make more money on the next contract
7133627 the love of the game theyre playing as much for the money and thats where you have to interact so much with your players and understand them and see what motivates them
7133628 well there are three or four things that come immediately to mind
7133629 one our players are not coming out with the same training they had previously in college
7133630 two players are different in that you have to show and teach and explain why things are done
7133631 its not so much do it because the coach said do it
7133632 but maybe the biggest difference is theres so much more information to give to the guys theres a lot more computer stuff digital video so theres more information and more new guys every year twenty years ago you had the same starters for the most part for seven or eight years now theres more information pumping to more guys every year and you need to get guys playing well very quickly
7133633 as the multiples of film breakdowns increase you have multiples of multiples
7133634 you dont have as much hard data as when plays and personnel groups were similar now you have film of things occurring one or two or three times how much can you bank on a formation theyve used three times in four weeks what does that mean or a blitz they run one time last month theres a lot of that
7133635 i came here to try to show nick i have a bit of game and if i play well i have a great chance clarke said
7133636 this week has been good in that i have hit a lot of good shots and made a lot of chances
7133637 they were always sharp and motivated and defended very well and we didnt create enough chances to win the game wenger said
7133638 in the first half in midfield we were dominated and not strong or quick enough and we suffered
7133639 just getting this piece of work done is an accomplishment because it is so complicated so difficult to build we are so happy already if we do win the race thats a bonus
7133640 our neighbour thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
7133641 here today in the hardest times for georgia we proclaim that georgia has the right for freedom the right for independence

7133652 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts similar to the safe place pink triangle campaign
7133653 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7133654 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem
7133655 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources council should provide money to employ security guards
7133656 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police
7133657 we need more police presence and safety measures not just putting a label on it

7133665 the candidate of change went with the status quo in picking sen joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions

7133669 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7133670 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7133671 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7133672 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7133673 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7133674 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7133675 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7133676 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7133677 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7133678 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7133679 now that the situation has changed in iraq they are going to a new front and thats afghanistan
7133680 the plane managed to takeoff then it started to sway from side to side until it fell
7133681 we would have gotten the same information had it been a janitor speaking to us
7133682 we owe this to the victims and passengers the md is a type of plane which is flying at the moment and as such it is of interest to global aviation to know exactly what happened
7133683 investigators located a downed aircraft which was fully engulfed in flames
7133684 none of the occupants of the plane survived the crash
7133685 the exact cause of the crash remains undetermined at this time

7133688 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7133689 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7133690 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7133691 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7133692 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7133693 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7133694 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on
7133695 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7133696 ive known greg since his first days as a major league player back in chicago
7133697 and i know what he brings to the club even at 42 years old i know how much knowledge he has and his ability to help those around him besides pitching every fifth day
7133698 one of the thoughts on bringing greg in here was that will give us another starter
7133699 and if we can get penny back maybe well slide somebody into the pen to help them out until saito comes back as omar or anybody else can tell you every day you look to figure out another way to make it work just a little bit better
7133700 we really felt getting casey was a key for us because this team has been through a lot this year injury wise
7133701 for a team trying to keep its head above water to be able to add casey i think gave them some encouragement that ownership was on board and the baseball front office was on board to support that effort
7133702 it wasnt like we were negotiating that for days or really even a half a day it was late morning in la probably 10 30 here with a 1 oclock deadline that we started to get serious about it thankfully i had had a number of conversations with neal going back to february and we knew what their interests were so it wasnt like we had to start from zero with the clock ticking
7133703 i was in the line for offensive linemen when i saw a kid who was just huge
7133704 he was a freaking monster it was mike adams ed note damn right it was coach bollman introduced us and we just hit it off right off the bat i met mike on the first day of camp and we hung out the rest of the time we started talking on myspace after camp ended and kept in contact throughout the summer before my junior year the next week after the ohio state camp i went to a michigan camp for one day i ran into j b shugarts who i knew from talking on the internet i told him that he really needed to check out ohio state at the time he was really into michigan a lot he was tight with ryan mallett we exchanged numbers and we stayed in contact after that he visited ohio state after leaving camp and he saw what i was telling him about the coaching staff and the facilities at that point ohio state told big mike shugarts kyle long 3 and me that they were counting on us being buckeyes i was getting ready for my junior year at edgewater and started thinking seriously about all of us being together and winning rings at the next level i never really thought it would happen but i was going to try to make it work out because i was so tight with those guys
7133705 we were all sitting around a big table and everyone was there
7133706 everything was great today and i know i want to be a buckeye and right now im committing to ohio state university
7133707 but i always came back to the thought that i belonged there ohio state
7133708 hey insert recruits name here come to ohio state lets win rings championships and et cetera and et cetera
7133709 after i committed to ohio state i had my cell phone number changed to end the recruiting calls
7133710 it worked great for a while too one day i showed up for school and urban meyer was standing in the front office there was no way around him and he cornered me and asked me for my cell phone number
7133711 im asking other pharmaceutical organizations to follow lillys lead and show the public theres nothing to hide
7133712 pasteurized in the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act and the agency does not object to the notification
7133713 perhaps the fda should call up a billion dollar team to consider irradiating another health hazard the fda itself which is almost as dangerous to our health as the pharmaceutical industry
7133714 the basic cause of illness is unhappiness therefore the great healer is joy

7133717 thought can bring about many things when thought is intensely concentrated it can exert great influence every faculty of the mind both conscious and unconscious down to the innermost point must be focused without distraction to accomplish this the concentrated thought must spell out every step of the desired result in detail
7133718 there is indeed evidence that for certain types of physical conditions sounds or vibrations of various kinds can be used to promote healing sounds chants prayers and music play a role in many healing traditions sound waves may well have a direct effect on certain aspects of bodily functioning

7133738 theres this memo going around the office on which myron says you wrote insulting and scatological comments
7133739 i acknowledged the memo and passed it to the next name on the list
7133740 i see but since your initials are bs and since you printed them in green block letters about three inches high you can understand how your acknowledgment could have been misconstrued
7133741 myron i read the memo you are a fool of your own making barry merely had the temerity to point it out
7133742 myron you will oblige me by returning to your own office
7133743 it pains me to say but i dont have a choice
7133744 youre the best writer ive got one of the best creative minds ever worked for me you even look good in a suit if i remember correctly
7133745 i just mention it you could wear farmer pants id keep you in a back office but you could wear them

7133754 i gave des a few bucks when he started so im already a minor investor
7133755 what would you need to be a full partner assuming of course that you want to move to the west coast which i can personally recommend as an excellent idea regardless of business interests
7133756 i can see why it looks remote on the other hand you had the required number on the tip of your tongue so i will infer that the prospect is one you have given serious thought to i could help you a little mind i say a little
7133757 you and i will sit down in a businesslike manner and negotiate a sum which is equally unsatisfactory to both of us
7133758 stay or move as you like the quo for this particular quid is you dont work for another agency in this market
7133759 myron will have been in charge for a year the place will be floundering bringing you back might help him straighten out but hes too dumb to re hire you even if you are still around which you should have the good fortune not to be and youre too smart to return you may do what you like

7133782 dubya bush will go down in history as the worst president the us has ever had one who cared more about his personal agenda than about the welfare of the nation he has left us on the doorstep of economic collapse massively in debt with the peoples republic of china holding the notes he has very nearly destroyed our status as a world superpower and definitely destroyed the respect which our allies and other nations held for this once great nation
7133783 he has left us on the doorstep of economic collapse massively in debt with the peoples republic of china holding the notes
7133784 he has very nearly destroyed our status as a world superpower and definitely destroyed the respect which our allies and other nations held for this once great nation

7133787 when realistic evidence of progress toward these conditions is shown then active citizens for education and the general public will actively and willingly support the district with appropriate financial means anything short of meeting these conditions will not be in the best interests of our children and the community
7133788 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
7133789 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7133790 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7133791 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7133792 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7133793 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7133794 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
7133795 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7133796 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7133797 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7133798 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7133799 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7133800 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7133801 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7133802 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7133803 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7133804 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7133805 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7133806 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7133807 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7133808 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7133809 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7133810 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7133811 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7133812 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7133813 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7133814 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7133815 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7133816 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7133817 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7133818 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7133819 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7133820 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7133821 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7133822 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7133823 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7133824 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7133825 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7133826 has at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally
7133827 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7133828 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7133829 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7133830 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7133831 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7133832 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7133833 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7133834 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7133835 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7133836 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7133837 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7133838 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7133839 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7133840 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7133841 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7133842 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7133843 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7133844 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7133845 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7133846 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7133847 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7133848 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7133849 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7133850 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7133851 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7133852 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7133853 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7133854 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7133855 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7133856 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7133857 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7133858 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7133859 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7133860 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7133861 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7133862 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7133863 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7133864 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7133865 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7133866 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7133867 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7133868 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7133869 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7133870 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7133871 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7133872 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7133873 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7133874 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7133875 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7133876 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7133877 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7133878 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7133879 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7133880 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7133881 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7133882 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7133883 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7133884 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7133885 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7133886 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7133887 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica

7133890 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7133891 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

7133893 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7133894 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7133895 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7133896 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7133897 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7133898 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7133899 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7133900 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7133901 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7133902 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7133903 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7133904 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7133905 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7133906 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7133907 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7133908 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7133909 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7133910 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7133911 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7133912 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7133913 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7133914 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7133915 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7133918 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7133930 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7133931 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7133932 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7133933 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7133938 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

7134020 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it

7134022 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7134023 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7134024 confident that we can take this country in a new direction that we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years that we wont just win this election in november well restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people and what america is as a nation
7134025 i know my feet are in the right place and im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states barack obama
7134026 the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen that you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words the most important issues of our day ive been in total agreement with president bush
7134027 mccain will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7134028 but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers

7134036 but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
7134037 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
7134038 we would work with whatever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence
7134039 if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence
7134040 ok well theres got to be some sort of change after all i have an idea what should be the case politically so theres must be something going on there
7134041 but your life individually didnt change just your attitude about the whos in charge you either like the person in charge or you dont thats it its your attitude that changed
7134042 not really your life will still be the same so why get involved in the first place
7134043 vem faen beh ver gud n r man har claes elfsberg
7134044 well toon that because you look like the player type
7134045 coming our way along with quite a few oddities but whatever we see it informs our work so we know what is going on in the world good bad or indifferent
7134046 the green partys agonised indecision about whether to support labours proposed emissions trading scheme is in microcosm the story of the species failure to face up to climate change
7134047 the boilerplate answer to the partys dilemma is that that the practice of politics is one of tactical compromise in showing itself to be a reliably pragmatic partner of labour the greens could keep alive the possibility of a labour led centre left coalition government after the election in spurning legislation that does not fulfil all their expectations they risk looking like purist ideologues aloof from and irrelevant to the hard business of governing
7134048 the danger is that if the ets passes with green support the main parties and the country will sit back and regard the job as done
7134049 dead hand of the state is contributing to the countrys rather alarming productivity record

7134060 la imagen que se tiene de que las monjas son mujeres tristes desilusionadas de la vida y no realizadas
7134061 the only real critique was and remains the critique of the left because it alone is based on knowledge
7134062 we need to think about what is happening around us within us each and everyday
7134063 for us in our society with the forms of exchange and the division of labour which govern it there is no social relation relation with the other without a certain alienation
7134064 to sum up work leisure family life and private life make up a whole which we can call a global structure or totality on condition that we emphasize its historical shifting transitory nature if we consider the critique of everyday life as an aspect of a concrete sociology we can envisage a vast enquiry which will look at professional life and leisure activities in terms of their many sided interactions our particular concern will be to extract what is living new positive the worthwhile needs and fulfilments from the negative elements the alienations
7134065 so to reach reality we must indeed tear away the veil that veil which is forever being born and reborn of everyday life and which masks everyday life along with its deepest and loftiest ambitions
7134066 the true critique of everyday life will have as its prime objective the separation between the human real and possible and bourgeois decadence and will imply a rehabilitation of everyday life 127
7134067 and nowadays we are still struggling with this deep in other words everyday contradiction what makes each of us a human being also turns that human being into something inhuman
7134068 the private consciousness and the mystified consciousness go hand in hand reinforcing each other and becoming increasingly entrenched as a result of instabilities which have their origins in real life and not in pure ideas
7134069 although deprivation and alienation are different for the proletarian and the non proletarian one thing unites them money the human beings alienated essence this alienation is constant i e practical and everyday
7134070 analysis must therefore distinguish between the real human world on the one hand the totality of human works and their reciprocal action upon man and on the other the unreality of alienation
7134071 the associated producers must govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way bringing it under their collective control instead of being dominated by it as a blind power
7134072 i dont want people saying how sad that beautiful hair all gone never
7134073 it should be your own decision none of us is to say anything
7134074 i think what she finds unbearable is not so much her pain and sickness but the fear of it getting worse and of losing control
7134075 does it happen at all that people pull out at the last minute
7134076 quite often i go home again and a new appointment is made but in many cases the patient passes away between visits
7134077 can i just ask you something is there still a lot you feel you need to do
7134078 i can always come back later if you are not ready
7134079 hey ol lady im gonna go check on the river
7134080 as a whole joe biden is considered a friend of labor
7134081 on immigration he has on occasion voted for increasing caps for certain immigration visas that the afl cio has opposed so that will be something to keep an eye on since immigration will be back on the policy agenda in the new administration
7134082 sometimes i just dont feel fresh even after i reboot
7134083 its been going pretty well thank god my body has held up as well as can be expected ive had some really good opportunities being trained by the wwe ive worked for tna and i just started working for ring of honor its really been kind of a fun ride
7134084 never really worries about doing things extra just to get over with the crowd i get in there i do my thing and i just try to bring them into the match as much as possible so far its worked out for me
7134085 when i first started it was very surreal getting trained by bob holly every day the surreal part stopped when they kept beating your ass every day all day long it was one of the greatest experiences ive ever had
7134086 at the conversation that i had with that member of tna management as soon as he said we think you might be too big for the x division samoa joe walked out of the locker room with the x division title thats the funny part about that conversation its like somebody set that up
7134087 first a disclaimer this document isnt meant to be a definitive

7134089 some shyster sold him a rusty wooden shafted golf club

7134091 contraception is not abortion the bush administrations proposal to change the definition of abortion and reduce womens access to birth control must be stopped
7134092 redefining abortion federal officials considering a rule allowing health care workers to refuse to provide contraceptives
7134093 for years and years he pushed art on the bridges
7134094 he had an uphill battle a lot of people dont realize that art adds value to public space he understood that and thought we need to put art on the bridges he just forced it to happen
7134095 ideas take time you never know how things are going to progress in the public mindset
7134096 fifty percent of the people in paris when it went up thought it was useless
7134097 he doesnt sleep for nine months its got to be perfect
7134098 he also thinks about how its going to be put together he thinks of how it can be built theres no point if it cant be produced
7134099 its the first time that art and sculpture were a category in the olympics
7134100 the thing that was really special to us was that only eight americans were selected for finalists and we were two of them we were 25 percent of the team
7134101 im probably the most un athletic person ever if i told people i was competing in the olympics they would say you you have no muscles but this is a different muscle that we use
7134102 probably most people couldnt conceive of working with their spouse
7134103 but we have a similar design sense we just love being together and working together we do a lot of decision making together

7134107 think of a cartoon bubble above your head for three years yours as been shouting pain pain pain relentlessly now its empty you have to fill it with something new what is it going to be
7134108 i dont think this will either antagonize or assuage her supporters
7134109 sen clinton likes joe biden and i dont think he said a bad word about her during the entire campaign theres no animosity or enmity at all in that sense hes a safe pick but shes the only person who was going to automatically bring her supporters back into the fold
7134110 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7134111 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7134112 hrc fans have been electrified by the late buzz on her dark horse potential
7134113 that is i havent heard anything to indicate that she is under serious consideration but that hasnt tamped down the hope
7134114 i believe the overwhelming polling data that sen clinton would have helped sen obama the most to win the election especially in battleground states
7134115 having said that i completely support the decision he has made as his alone and will support joe biden
7134116 joes smart and funny but this is not exactly an exciting choice
7134117 i know politics things just dont happen that way hillary knew that anyone who thought he would put her on the ticket is just clueless
7134118 its a big mistake not to choose her its sad and its a sure way to guarantee the republicans will win
7134119 obama cant do this on his own this ticket isnt going to be able to compete and cant overcome the lack of unity only hillary can bring them that
7134120 people will be disappointed that its not her on the ticket
7134121 but we hope that enough time has passed that her supporters have gotten over it and are in a place where they can support the partys ticket
7134122 shell go in shell wow them and shell get out of the way
7134123 if obama picks hillary he gets her 18 million supporters and we would win in a cakewalk and control the white house for 16 years
7134124 once the fire was out it was not a problem
7134125 times change peoples needs change this is not a museum even in a museum they change out the artwork
7134126 i consider it tragic that any work of public art should be considered expendable
7134127 this work which i consider very important should certainly stay up forever
7134128 we are a commercial society and i think our society is reflected on the walls of the airport
7134129 atlanta is the most laissez faire city in the most laissez faire country
7134130 but this is one more way we are losing our individuality
7134131 its very discouraging that they would take something down after an agreement was made that it would be permanent
7134132 seeing it again was like seeing someone you love very much after a long time
7134133 they put the clampers on us held us down and we lost our confidence
7134134 we just werent able to handle the heat they put us under
7134135 we put it all on the floor every game and left nothing for anyone else
7134136 we played the best the whole tournament and are deserving of the gold medal
7134137 i put on this uniform since i was in 11th grade and had wonderful opportunity to represent our country on the junior national team and then world championships and four olympics i didnt win these four medals alone i had so many players who had such an impact on me and now that ive become the oldest player i try to do the exact thing with sylvia fowles and candace parker the fact i won four golds shows the level of dominance ive been able to be participate in with so many great players
7134138 lisa is one person that a lot of us as veterans or newcomers we can all emulate her lifestyle and her game
7134139 she is a woman first a mother second a basketball player third when you can have all those entities tied into one and still be considered the best hands down to you she is successful on and off the court a great mother and a great player how much sweeter can it get for her

7134186 it is my personal opinion that companies who seek to charge more than the cost of issuing the policy are in direct violation of new york state insurance law when they seek to retain premium instead of issuing proper audit refunds to their construction clients

7134272 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7134273 it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and played so well on all surfaces
7134274 i would think it does reduce the pressure five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered so maybe now it changes a little bit
7134275 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7134276 rafa has played great so he deserves the number one position hes in a way the favourite now all of a sudden even on hard courts because hes played so so well
7134277 when you want to win the goal is the same and the pressure is the same
7134278 i am not thinking that i am number one or number two i have been happy being number two for the last three years
7134279 i know how tough it is to be number one and i know i can just as easily slip back to number two or number three
7134280 i have to try to enjoy this moment and accept it because i am not always going to play like i did the last six months right now i am having the best moment of my career
7134281 the last couple of weeks for me were really exhausting
7134282 i had to travel all over the world because i went from cincinnati i went back home and then went to beijing and then came here everything in 10 days you can imagine how i feel

7134307 my father used to say that my brother likes to tell false things all the time he told me to be careful of that
7134308 i just hope that these allegations are false and what hes saying is true
7134309 if not then hes been misleading me and a lot of other people for a long long time

7134313 i cant discuss the localization issues at this time as for the decision to bring it to the wii i think there were many i think its fair to say that cj wanted to bring one of its premier franchises possibly the premier franchise when you look at the japanese market to the broader audience that the wii represents at least thats one of many variables that pushed it in that direction
7134314 why dead rising is coming to the wii instead of lost planet probably a number of reasons not the least of which was interest in doing dr the goal so far as im aware is still 100 zombies on screen at once ive yet to see that goal realized myself though in any event i think its fair to say that gunplay does play a larger role in ctyd than it did in the 360 owing to the re4 aiming mechanics that doesnt mean there arent loads of dr mechanics too its just the the balance does seem to have shifted somewhat in any event i think its fair to say that folks havent seen all of the surprises we have in store for the game so ill have to ask for everyones continued patience until were a bit closer to release

7134324 they are barely making it too and are feeling the squeeze as much as anybody
7134325 the foreign policy experience that sen biden brings is unmatched
7134326 so you have this incredible change agent in obama and someone with unparalleled foreign policy experience somebody who appeals to working class iowans

7134333 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7134334 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7134335 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7134336 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7134337 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7134338 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7134339 that little 10 mph wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer

7134365 this is a strong violation of the spirit of tae kwon do and the olympic games
7134366 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7134367 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7134368 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7134369 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7134370 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7134371 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7134372 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7134373 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7134374 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7134375 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7134376 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7134377 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7134378 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7134379 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7134380 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7134381 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7134382 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7134383 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7134384 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7134385 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7134386 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7134387 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7134388 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7134389 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7134390 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7134391 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7134392 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7134393 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7134394 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7134395 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7134396 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7134397 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7134398 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7134399 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7134400 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7134401 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7134402 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7134403 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7134404 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7134405 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7134406 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7134407 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7134408 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7134409 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7134410 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7134411 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7134412 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7134413 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7134414 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7134415 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7134416 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7134417 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7134418 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7134419 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7134420 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7134421 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7134422 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7134423 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7134424 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7134425 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7134426 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7134427 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7134428 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7134429 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7134430 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7134431 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7134432 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7134433 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7134434 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7134435 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7134436 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7134437 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7134438 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7134439 nah ill wait till i get some sales under my belt
7134440 deliberately rather than inadvertently startles and offends its audience by violating norms for social values and personal ideals
7134441 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7134442 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7134443 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7134444 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7134445 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7134446 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7134447 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7134448 this is a planning took where all things are going
7134449 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7134450 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7134451 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7134452 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7134453 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7134454 i hate you you didnt spend enough money on my birthday you ruined my life
7134455 whatever who said i wanted you to make nameplates anyway
7134456 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7134457 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7134458 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7134459 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7134460 kalau ditanya cocok aku cocok sama dia kalau ditanya sayang aku sayang sama dia kalau ditanya baik dia baik
7134461 mudah mudahan dia randy bisa dapet yang terbaik entah dia dapet yang lain atau balik lagi sama aku
7134462 mungkin udah terlalu lama gua mengambil peran yang baik baik saja
7134463 sebagai pemain sinetron memerankan tokoh antagonis itu tantangan buat dia
7134464 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
7134465 masalah urusan saya pribadi itu menjadi urusan pribadi sendri juga
7134466 aku sita supaya tidak bisa dijual supaya nanti bisa jatuh ke anak anak
7134467 because i loved you a birthmothers view of open adoption
7134468 a mistake is only a mistake until youve learned from it then its a lesson
7134469 children are never really ours they are only entrusted to us for a time by god
7134470 i dont like you much right now but i still love you

7134483 linux calls it oops but its basically equivalent to a windows blue screen
7134484 its kind of the same thing in terms of what causes it and what it does except we dont make it blue we just print the message
7134485 fedora is involved because we track the kernel very aggressively
7134486 the kerneloops capability also supports our dedication to a healthy cooperation with upstream software providers like the kernel developer community it leverages the widespread use of fedora for the direct benefit of that community who can see measurable results of their work and shift resources as needed to target frequent or important issues
7134487 in general kernel developers are open to kerneloops since the more reports i have the more data they have
7134488 if you have one report it could just be a fluke but if youve got 500 reports of the same pattern you know its a real bug
7134489 we are fixing the bugs that have a lot of people hitting them
7134490 if you look at the number of unique bugs the numbers can be confusing for the 2 6 25 kernel there were 1 300 bugs only half of which only happened once we do fix a lot of bugs but if you look at what we fix its the ones that actually matter
7134491 in a few months from now it might be something different
7134492 what kerneloops is doing is wonderful in helping the upstream kernel developers track what is going wrong and what needs to be fixed
7134493 of course more users testing the nightly kernel releases of the main kernel org tree is very helpful in finding problems that happen during the development cycle but that being said the linux kernel has a very good record of quality and stability over time
7134494 its important to track bugs and get visibility into what is causing them
7134495 but its also just one arrow in our quality improvement quiver
7134496 our technical advisory board and andrew morton recently starting tracking the
7134497 we plan on publishing a paper in the future that ranks the greatest bug finders and fixers by name
7134498 senator joe biden is will be a highly effective running mate for barack obama and more importantly will be a valued trusted and supremely qualified vice president of the united states
7134499 joe biden is ready to serve as barack obamas partner in the urgent mission to bring about the change america needs to put our country back on track

7134517 if i could wave a wand and the lord said i could solve one problem i would solve the energy crisis
7134518 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7134519 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7134520 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7134521 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7134522 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7134523 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7134524 that little 10 m p h wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer
7134525 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through
7134526 culture is very important to what you do in education that is why ever since the early 1990s with the task force on education report it was realized the critical importance of bahamianizing the curriculum any extent possible
7134527 in china you have a very strong confucius culture a very strong culture based upon obedience and subservience where you are taught from the beginning who s on top and who s on the bottom
7134528 that is a very good matrix on which the chinese have focused a very disciplined approach to education but it is also greatly assisted by their culture that is more than 2 000 years old
7134529 in the bahamas we have to find bahamian ways to achieve the same result
7134530 we cannot impose a method of education that is culturally inconsistent with or at odds with the bahamian culture
7134531 what we have to find is the ways to drag out from our culture all that is best about it
7134532 one only needs to look at the things that we do whether it is our cultural commitment to excellence such as in the sailing profession and productions in junkanoo
7134533 we need to find bahamian ways to draw from each person all that is best in keeping with the traditions of our culture
7134534 we need to ignite in every child and every parent a burning desire for their children to achieve their dreams through education
7134535 thats a pretty good idea on ikeas part to get people into its doors

7134539 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7134540 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7134541 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7134542 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7134543 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7134544 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote

7134569 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7134570 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7134571 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7134572 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7134573 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7134574 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines

7134579 why would we want her last years to be in a drive through zoo in mexico when she could have 300 acres in the lush tennessee countryside
7134580 if we stripped everything away and say what is in the best interest of jenny the sanctuary would win hands down
7134581 but then you have to add in all the politics

7134607 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
7134608 we have magic johnson that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl
7134609 so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible
7134610 but baseball is such a big business in the united states players with potential to play in the big leagues arent allowed to come
7134611 i would like to be optimistic and hope that in 2016 we will have a chance again

7134619 i think your mother instincts really kick in the day you find out that youre pregnant and for me its been a blast preparing for it getting the nursery ready and all that so were both really looking forward to it
7134620 thats definitely the frustrating part about it but our home is very private and what goes on in our home is very private
7134621 people just really see pictures and make assumptions of what were doing
7134622 we havent decided where were going to raise our kid but for the first year well stay in california
7134623 i love it look at how nice and sweet everyone is to me
7134624 to look in the peoples eyes and see the affection and the happiness i like that a lot to see that and provoke that in people
7134625 it was hard for me when my profession decided they didnt want me as much
7134626 sitting at home and waiting for the phone to ring is not a profession
7134627 in the near future ill be designing my own clothes as well so im looking forward to that

7134635 fulham started the game better than us and were sharper in the first half although i dont think they created too much if you look at the game as a whole
7134636 they had a corner and they took advantage from it that illustrates the first half we were not sharp enough we were not first enough on the ball the corner showed that and we were punished when you are focussed you can stop them scoring like that from the middle of the goal
7134637 after that we tried to come back in the second half but i feel we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes and wanted to create on our own rather than keeping our vision around the box that is we missed a lot today
7134638 we lacked a bit more quality in our passing we you look at the possession we had and what we did with it that is always a sign it is only down power but vision and technical quality that was there today i dont know why you have to credit to fulham as well
7134639 you need to keep a balance when i brought on bendtner we already had van persie nasri and adebayor you needed to win the ball back so you needed to keep three midfielders
7134640 it was the kind of game where you could not afford to make a mistake and we made a massive one it was a game where if you get to half time at 0 0 then you would win the game that is the biggest regret i have
7134641 people can borrow greater amounts at cheaper rates than ever before invest in a multitude of instruments catering to every possible profile of risk and return and share risks with strangers from across the globe have these undoubted benefits come at a cost
7134642 a better approach is for the homeowner to buy an insurance policy that pays off only in the contingency when it is needed i e when the storm hits
7134643 similarly for a bank it may be more efficient to arrange for a contingent capital infusion in the event of a crisis rather than keeping permanent idle capital sitting on the balance sheet
7134644 the added flexibility associated with the insurance option may therefore help to reduce the externalities associated with bank distress while at the same time minimizing the potential costs of public bailouts during crises as well as the drag on intermediation in normal times

7134647 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts similar to the safe place pink triangle campaign
7134648 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7134649 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem
7134650 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources council should provide money to employ security guards
7134651 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police
7134652 we need more police presence and safety measures not just putting a label on it

7134658 it was 8am on a monday over a year ago when suddenly there were all these voices in my house i thought they were jehovahs witnesses at first then they said they were the police they didnt tell me why they were there for ages but they knew things about my children their names and what they were doing i got more and more scared i dont think ive ever shaken so badly then they showed me the search warrant i couldnt believe my eyes the words indecent images of children i was in shock and had no inkling of what my partner was doing yet at the same time i had a sort of sudden understanding of why he hadnt been easy to live with for so long i had to send the police off to the business we run to arrest him i thought thats the end of my world the first thing he said when he was arrested was im going to have to commit suicide thats the first thing i thought hed do when i read the search warrant ive known him for 20 years i knew what hed think meanwhile they searched the house took away any computer materials the senior policewoman came with me to wake my teenage daughter i told her what had happened she didnt take it in then we went to the school my other daughters were taken into a room one by one with me and their older sister and the police and told what had happened they were devastated then without me they were questioned about their relationship with their father it was devastating that their dad had this interest and also that someone might think he was doing that to them which was not the case they chewed us up and spat out how do you deal with it we did lots of talking we were all sitting on a bed that night and someone thought of dad all on his own and we sent him a text saying we loved and supported him and were there for him he didnt come home he could have but didnt it was better that we had some space we spoke on the phone the next night it was dreadful hes such a kind hearted person and he felt strongly that he wanted his children to have a childhood yet it didnt occur to him that he was taking away someone elses ive always thought the people doing these things were monsters but i cant think that any more because this does not define him he has a heartfelt desire to deal with the problem and it is something he has to atone for he got a non custodial sentence but this has tainted him forever i feel tainted forever i didnt tell anyone for an awfully long time my mother and siblings dont know i did tell a few friends but aside from one couple who stood by both of us they support me but not him i dont blame them but it upsets me it doesnt work unless they support all of us im an open person but i cant communicate with people in the way i used to there is always this black cloud that i cant tell anyone about i feel sad about it but i made the choice for my family to have as normal a future as possible and for my future and his to be as normal as possible wed been together for years but actually got married after this happened just our daughters were present we realised our family was the most important thing in our life and as a couple we have a lot of work to do but that has to come after he has done the work on himself first if i didnt have absolute confidence that in his heart he wants to overcome this i couldnt do it none of us view his arrest as anything but positive because it is really the only route out he needed help to stop i know that he tried to stop himself at least once because actions he took which didnt make sense at the time now fall into place but how could anybody with three daughters addicted to illegal activities of this nature and on whom the entire family was financially dependent ever admit what he was doing
7134659 when my husband and i were first arrested we were about to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary so i thought i knew him

7134760 while its early it looks to us like the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7134761 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7134762 the economy has not recovered sufficiently so that withdrawal of the stimulus does look like it will create an air pocket afterwards
7134763 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7134764 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7134765 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7134766 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7134767 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7134768 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers
7134769 a lot of people come in theyre worried about the increase in crime my co worker was attacked or assaulted theyre just more alert theyre in a different zone their awareness is peaked they wonder what if this happened to me
7134770 my husband is set to deploy in january and wanted to be sure i was completely knowledgeable and capable of handling a firearm because he wants to get me one before he leaves
7134771 more guns lead to more people being hurt or harmed fewer people need guns i really only think police and people who are supposed to protect us should have it that doesnt mean a woman shouldnt protect her self say martial arts
7134772 we dont want to put a gun in the hands of someone who is uncomfortable with it because it can be turned and used against them they could hurt themselves someone in their homes their pet we want to make sure they are comfortable and know what to do and how to use it we want them to be safe thats the whole point

7134784 the booing was perfectly understandable because we are the world champions and we cannot afford to lose two in a row its unacceptable to play like that
7134785 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player it was not good enough and unfortunately those mistakes killed us
7134786 its not nice being booed but the crowd is unhappy rightfully so they have every right to be unhappy
7134787 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7134788 youve got to be happy with that the performance was by no means error free but it was never going to be with south africa such a desperate team but the intensity was there the boys got up and did what had to be done the hard way they gutsed it out it was not straightforward and im very happy with the composure
7134789 the boys got up and met the physicality of the springboks they did huge work and it was a good effort

7134795 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
7134796 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environment friendly pest control strategies
7134797 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavour of the resulting oils
7134798 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
7134799 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
7134800 in an age of images and entertainment in an age of instant emotional gratification we do not want honesty or even reality but the reassurance of old cliches stereotypes and mythic narratives we want leaders who are willing to pretend they live in a make believe world of happy couples and perfect relationships we want to feel that they like us and we want to like them this gives us what television gives us a simplistic narrative around which to frame our lives this narrative defies the messiness and disorder of the real world

7134810 faithless infidels and their hypocrite allies from amongst the so called muslims who have bartered their faith in return of just one seat in the parliament
7134811 our goal is azadi baraa e islam freedom for islam
7134812 is islam incompatible with a secular society and must a muslim majority live only in an islamic state
7134813 like the hindutva hardliners hinduised the shrine board for amarnath yatris geelani has used a political slogan to provide the separatist movement with a pan islamic colour muslims might have been enslaved or free in the last 1 400 years but islam has never been a slave to anyone since its not a slave it doesnt need to be freed
7134814 islam is democratic in spirit and has no conflict with secular composite nationalism an idea that the likes of geelani vehemently oppose
7134815 its as difficult for a muslim to live in a non muslim society as it is for a fish to live in a desert
7134816 when i asked him to explain his theory of muslims discomfort in a non muslim society he said that it was ordained by the quran if the separatists succeed kashmir will turn into another talibanised afghanistan
7134817 pakistans original idea of establishing an islamic state was never realised yes pakistan has a city called islamabad but true islam remains in india
7134818 the prophet proved muslims could co exist with non muslims through the covenant of medina he signed with the jews both the jews and the muslims became citizens of medina with their separate identities
7134819 it is the muslims duty to serve humanity every part of gods land is sacred and all inhabitants of the land are dear to them

7134874 it was great to go out there and back myself and perform for the team i didnt get a score in the first match against bermuda so i was determined to get a big score in the second match
7134875 at the start of my knock the ball was not really coming on as the pitch here is a bit slow
7134876 the medium pacers were bowling quite well so i knew i had to be patient and smart about what i was doing after i got in i began to feel better and better and the outfield was quick i knew all i had to do was push the ball around and hit away the bad balls
7134877 im getting to the level where i would like to be but i still have to keep putting in the hard work
7134878 i want to reach that level where im consistently getting good scores and contributing to the team i will use my first hundred as a stepping stone towards better things in the future

7134966 youre either part of the problem or part of the solution
7134967 making it hard to talk to an agent really hurts companies in their satisfaction ratings
7134968 but the reason why they do it is that talking to an agent is expensive and using automation is cheap
7134969 it can be a devil or an angel depending on how its used

7134972 they have wonderful ways of not letting you get through to cancel their service
7134973 theyre very quick to say well give you a contract and you have 30 days to change your mind but they make it so aggravating to cancel some of these people will just say ill keep it
7134974 we are continually working to improve customer service so that we can quickly and effectively answer their questions resolve issues and increase the value customers receive
7134975 i think it would probably be very useful for people who are in a jam
7134976 if you dont have proof that you canceled it or tried to cancel it its your word against theirs
7134977 ask them what they want then give them what they want

7134982 but if i say ill slap a rapper or something its the headline news of the day thats ass backwards to me so im done
7134983 fuck this bum ass rap game anyway its full of fake ass niggas who pump poison to the kids make a few dollars and act like theyre larger then life when they know their music is detrimental to their fucking communities if it aint about sex its about drugs or violence where are the songs about getting an education or being responsible parents and shit or stopping the gang violence this shit is sickening

7134993 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7134994 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7134995 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7134996 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7134997 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7134998 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7134999 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7135003 i am a dj i started my career as a dj and a collector of records
7135004 the million dj march speaks to the longevity of the dj community if deejaying is going to survive in to the future we are going to have to take it a little more seriously than just a party past time
7135005 once and for all the american public needs to hear from the djs in a unified voice there are questions that the american public has for for the dj and one of the concerns of the american public for djs in every medium is the lack of responsibility that djs show to younger ears the djs i know care about the public they play for many of them are responsible parents themsleves it is not that djs are irresponsible it is that djs do not speak in one unified voice on anything by signing your name to this event among other things you vow to uphold a standard of excellence in the art of deejaying
7135006 the million dj march is a call to excellence in the deejaying industry
7135007 this is your craft this is an opportunity to participate in the further development of your craft the uniqueness of the million dj march and its surrounding workshops provides an opportunity for those just getting started as well as the seasoned veterans to participate in the advancement of deejaying
7135008 i have been aware and informed about krs ones stop the violence movement and i think it is an extremely positive one

7135017 you wont be able to help me im past help
7135018 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7135019 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7135020 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7135021 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7135022 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7135023 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7135024 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7135025 i have a much higher iq in this photo by the white house and released by sen bidens office sen joe biden d del lower right sits on air force one with president clinton en route to bosnia on dec 22 1997 biden has lived a life of second chances a cycle thats been cruel and redemptive by turns now hes starting over once again deeply private yet in your face collegial yet ideological the delaware senator brings a wealth of foreign policy experience to barack obamas democratic ticket plus wisdom in the ways of washington and an infectious enthusiasm for political donnybrooks ap photo the white house than you do i suspect
7135026 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7135027 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7135028 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person
7135029 if we do nothing theres a serb victory and the continuation of genocide
7135030 if we do what you want we only have two options
7135031 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7135032 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7135033 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7135034 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7135035 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7135036 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7135037 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7135038 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7135039 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7135040 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7135041 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7135042 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7135043 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7135044 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7135045 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7135046 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7135047 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7135048 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7135049 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7135050 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7135051 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7135052 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7135053 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7135054 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7135055 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7135056 if enough super delegates would change their mind on a roll call the simplest scenario would be that she could win on a first roll call
7135057 theoretically a lot of things could happen you could have a roll call and enough delegates changed their minds then neither would have a majority anything could happen al gore could come into the picture then
7135058 the democrats havent had one since 1972 theyre going to have nominations from the floor if she can be nominated from the floor then others could be nominated from the floor nothing is written in stone ill be the last one to hold up my finger for hillary im going as a hillary delegate and im going to stay that way until she releases us
7135059 super delegates have more or less pledged their word to him obama but in politics whats the old saying can you believe a politician
7135060 they dont always tell the truth would this be an exception
7135061 someone out of the blue like al gore is not impossible the longer it goes when no one gets a majority its possible but not probable
7135062 ive been going since 1972 and this probably will be the most historical one
7135063 it should be interesting i hope i live 12 more years and go to three more
7135064 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7135065 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7135066 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7135067 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7135068 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7135069 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7135070 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7135071 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7135072 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7135073 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7135074 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7135075 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7135076 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7135077 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7135078 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7135079 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7135080 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7135081 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7135082 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7135083 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7135084 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7135085 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7135086 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7135087 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7135088 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7135089 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7135090 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7135091 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7135092 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7135093 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7135094 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7135095 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7135096 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7135097 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7135098 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7135099 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7135100 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7135101 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7135102 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7135103 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7135104 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7135105 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7135106 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7135107 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7135108 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7135109 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7135110 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7135111 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7135112 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7135113 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid

7135126 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7135127 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

7135136 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7135137 look at whats in the fridge throw most of them into a pot and lets see what happens
7135138 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7135139 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7135140 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7135141 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7135142 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7135143 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7135144 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7135145 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7135146 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7135147 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7135148 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7135149 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7135150 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7135151 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7135152 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7135153 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7135154 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7135155 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7135156 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7135157 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7135158 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7135159 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7135160 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7135161 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7135162 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7135163 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7135164 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7135165 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7135166 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7135167 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7135168 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7135169 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7135170 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7135171 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7135172 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7135173 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7135174 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7135175 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7135176 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7135177 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7135178 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7135179 yes i just might go to sleep but kindly leave leave the future leave it open
7135180 oh es grave no s pero no devolveremos ni una cerveza
7135181 mhm no te preocupes mhm nena cerillita disculpa me podr as prestar 3 pesos anda s que tienes ya que te los acabo de dar ahora regreso y te los pago
7135182 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7135183 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7135184 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7135185 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7135186 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7135187 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7135188 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7135189 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7135190 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7135191 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7135192 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7135193 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7135194 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7135195 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7135196 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7135197 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7135198 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7135199 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7135200 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7135201 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7135202 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7135203 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7135204 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7135205 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7135206 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7135207 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7135208 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7135209 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet

7135214 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7135215 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7135216 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7135217 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7135218 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7135219 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7135220 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7135221 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7135227 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7135228 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7135229 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7135230 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7135231 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7135232 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7135233 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7135234 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7135235 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7135236 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7135237 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7135238 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7135239 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7135240 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7135241 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7135242 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7135243 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7135244 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7135245 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7135246 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7135247 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7135248 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7135249 a veces dar a la impresi n de que la presidenta est desequilibrada o anda medio mal de la cabeza
7135250 la simbiosis patol gica del matrimonio presidencial en el ejercicio del poder
7135251 un l der del movimiento agropecuario y la causa del campo argentino
7135252 no estoy solo ya que hay muchos compa eros an nimos
7135253 todo eso que dice reafirma su humildad usted viene teniendo un papel protag nico y nos sentimos contentos de que eso ocurra porque hacen falta m s argentinos como usted
7135254 consensuar una pol tica con las entidades en el tema de la agricultura la ganader a y la lecher a
7135255 para que el pa s resurja hace falta m s nacionalismo
7135256 creo que s el nacionalismo de estar comprometidos con la patria para el bien de todos los argentinos tenemos que pensar que todos los argentinos tengan trabajo digno no sacarle a los ricos para darle a los pobres sino educaci n y buenos sueldos para todos
7135257 orgulloso como argentino al escucharlo en la arenga en la ruta 14
7135258 la causa del campo es fundamentalmente una causa patri tica y nacional

7135267 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7135268 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7135269 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7135270 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7135271 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7135272 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7135273 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7135274 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7135275 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7135276 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7135277 j ganhei e perdi para a leciane sempre tem muito equil brio
7135278 ela estava jogando bem e eu n o conseguia afundar as bolas contudo como aconteceu neste campeonato em porto alegre mantive a ra a e a vontade
7135279 quero somar mais pontos pois venci em uberl ndia depois em outubro ganhei wild card para o quali do challenger de floripa
7135280 ontem sexta feira ganhei da pires juliana terceira da lista de quem nunca tinha vencido
7135281 precisamos de ambos n s certamente temos que visitar os tra ados tradicionais como spa francorchamps que fez da f rmula 1 o que ela hoje mas tamb m necessitamos das novas pistas como val ncia que um lugar realmente empolgante
7135282 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7135283 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7135284 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7135285 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7135286 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7135287 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7135288 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7135289 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7135290 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7135291 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7135292 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7135293 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7135294 just tell them its something really cool that i made
7135295 ab dudh ka dudh or paani ka paani ho jayega
7135296 so were going to be giving away to hopefully the needy kids who ever they might be from all walks of life and back packs and that kind of thing to help them
7135297 i strongly support roe v wade thats why i led the fight to defeat bork roberts alito and thomas
7135298 if this ad leaves a bad taste in your mouth please give a thought to what sensitive animals think and feel when they come to the end of their frightening journey and see hear and smell the slaughterhouse
7135299 like human victims animals in slaughterhouses experience terror when they are attacked by a knife wielding assailant
7135300 we are challenging everyone who is rightly horrified by this crime to look into their hearts and consider leaving violence off their dinner plates
7135301 to alert women to the potential risks of osteoporosis and encourage them to take steps to protect their bones at every age
7135302 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7135303 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7135304 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7135305 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7135306 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7135307 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7135308 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7135309 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7135310 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7135311 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7135312 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7135313 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7135314 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7135315 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7135316 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7135317 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7135318 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7135319 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7135320 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7135321 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7135322 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7135323 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7135324 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7135325 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7135326 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7135327 yes you can hug me and yes you can squeeze me and yes you can have my caress yes you can hold me and yes you can kiss me and yes oh yes oh darling yes
7135328 suspensi n de sueldo por el doble de tiempo de inasistencia y listo que el bolsillo es donde les duele y fueron elegidos por nosotros y una vacancia tan simple dudo que sea positiva a la larga pero algo hay que hacer con la inasistencia injustificada
7135329 drink deeply pilgrim but dont forget theres still a woman beneath this resplendent chemise
7135330 i will build no more meaningful relationships with people at work
7135331 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7135332 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7135333 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7135334 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7135335 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7135336 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7135337 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7135338 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7135339 choose what you magnify because you can make the situation bigger than it actually is
7135340 vad fan r det med mig jag kan ju detta f r helvete det r ju det jag g r
7135341 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7135342 it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability

7135406 the opalescent colour is produced by the slower cooling of the molten glass in those parts which are thick causing some crystallization inside the glass
7135407 opalescent glass is a generalized term for clear and semi opaque pressed glass cloudy marbled and sometimes accented with subtle coloring all combining to form a milky opalescence in the glass while ren lalique may be recognized by most as the pinnacle of opalescent glassmaking glass first evolved in the late 1800s and early 1900s during the art nouveau period when american glassmakers transformed european glass used in cathedrals into the translucent milky glass we now refer to as opalescent john lafarge and louis comfort tiffany were two american artists who first experimented with opalescent effects driven by their desire to use glass in creating beautiful visual scenes in art without painting opalescent glass was first developed and patented by john lafarge in 1879 but it was tiffany who created the masterworks in glass for which he is still so well known today tiffany created totally new colors in glass new types of glass unparalleled in depth and coloration and used glass in new forms that evoked the forms of nature the opalescent effect is a glassmaking technique used by many manufacturers to greater or lesser degrees of artistry produced in the cooling process which creates the milky opalescent effect which illuminates any coloration when light shines on it sometimes the opalescent effect was created along the edge of a piece often coupled with wavy effects and making for an elegant yet subtle look this opalescence is also created in the glassmaking by alternating heating and cooling of the glass and with the addition of chemical additives to create the desired effect many u s manufacturers made this type of opalescent glass most notably fenton northwood hobbs and american glass while davidsons was the major european manufacturer based in the u k and giving their wares the marketing name of pearline there is also a type of opalescent glass which is made in layers and again the heating and re heating process is used to create the opalescent effect with the addition of chemical agents the degree and location of the opalescence is controlled as such by the glassmaking process and by the thickness of the glass itself as it forms itself in the molds given the intricacy of some of the designs the production of the metal molds in sufficient detail was an important part of the process many of the molds for french opalescent glass of the art deco period were done by franckhauser who did work for sabino and other contemporaries of lalique most of the finer glass of this period was done by the french but the english firm of james j jobling also created some innovative designs after having earlier sought to sign distribution deals with some of the major french factories today few glassmakers still make opalescent glass primarily due to the chemicals needed to execute the complex glassmaking process

7135410 i would say it probably would have been to our advantage to get bobby abreu out and we didnt do that i thought the key to the game was we didnt get abreu out at all he doesnt chase bad pitches and thats probably why hes the great hitter he is
7135411 i thought his velocity was good and he threw a couple of good sliders but too many pitches were up with the exception on sarfate and cherry we didnt get in on them and we got some pitches up
7135412 weve done our homework on him early in the game you have to make him throw the ball over the plate because he can expand the strike zone hes a master at hitting his spots and changing speeds

7135550 met het rijk der hemelen is het als met een landeigenaar die vroeg in de morgen uitging om arbeiders te huren voor zijn wijngaard hij werd het met de arbeiders eens voor een denarie per dag en stuurde ze naar zijn wijngaard rond het derde uur ging hij er weer op uit en zag nog anderen werkloos op de markt staan tot wie hij zei gaat ook naar mijn wijngaard en ik zal u geven wat billijk is en zij gingen rond het elfde uur ging hij opnieuw uit en vond er weer anderen staan hij zei tot hen wat staat ge heel de dag werkloos ze antwoordden hem niemand heeft ons gehuurd daarop zei hij tot hen gaat ook gij naar mijn wijngaard bij het vallen van de avond sprak de eigenaar van de wijngaard tot zijn rentmeester roep de arbeiders en betaal hun uit te beginnen met de laatsten en zo tot de eersten toen de arbeiders van het elfde uur kwamen kregen zij elk een denarie toen nu ook de eersten kwamen meenden dezen dat zij meer zouden krijgen maar ook zij kregen ieder de overeengekomen denarie ze namen hem wel aan maar begonnen tegen de landeigenaar te morren en zeiden dezen hier die het laatst gekomen zijn hebben maar een uur gewerkt en gij stelt ze gelijk met ons die de last van de dag en de brandende hitte hebben gedragen maar hij antwoordde een van hen vriend ik doe u toch geen onrecht zijt gij niet met mij overeengekomen voor een denarie neem wat u toekomt en ga heen mag ik soms met het mijne niet doen wat ik verkies of zijt ge kwaad omdat ik goed ben zo zullen de laatsten de eersten en de eersten de laatsten zijn
7135551 het rijk der hemelen gelijkt op een koning die een bruiloftsfeest gaf voor zijn zoon hij stuurde zijn dienaars uit om allen te roepen die hij tot de bruiloft had uitgenodigd maar zij wilden niet komen daarop zond hij andere dienaars met de opdracht zegt aan de genodigden zie ik heb mijn maaltijd klaar mijn ossen en het gemeste vee zijn geslacht alles staat gereed komt dus naar de bruiloft maar zonder er zich om te bekommeren gingen zij weg de een naar zijn akker de ander naar zijn zaken de overigen grepen zijn dienaars vast mishandelden en doodden hen nu ontstak de koning in toorn stuurde zijn troepen en liet de moordenaars ombrengen en hun stad in brand steken toen sprak hij tot zijn dienaars het bruiloftsmaal staat klaar maar de genodigden waren het niet waard gaat dus naar de drukke verkeerswegen en nodigt wie ge er maar vindt tot de bruiloft zijn dienaars gingen naar de wegen en brachten allen mee die zij er aantroffen slechten zowel als goeden en de bruiloftszaal liep vol met gasten toen de koning binnenkwam om de aanliggenden te bezoeken merkte hij daar iemand op die niet voor een bruiloft gekleed was en hij sprak tot hem vriend hoe zijt gij hier binnengekomen zonder bruiloftskleed maar de man bleef het antwoord schuldig toen sprak de koning tot de bedienden bindt hem aan handen en voeten en werpt hem buiten in de duisternis daar zal geween zijn en tandengeknars velen zijn geroepen maar weinigen uitverkoren

7135607 biden is especially intimate with the indian sub continent with biden the region especially pakistan and afghanistan will get greater attention with better clarity than at any time in the past india wont be neglected either given bidens leading role in pushing through the nuclear deal
7135608 in fact such is bidens familiarity with the indian community that he once made a faux pas of macaca like proportions but with a happier ending
7135609 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent most indian americans in delaware didnt take offense to bidens remark

7135626 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7135627 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7135628 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7135629 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7135630 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7135631 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers

7135651 we are seeking to confirm media reports that an australian has allege been kidnapped near mogadishu in somalia
7135652 of widespread armed conflict very high threat of terrorist attack against western interests
7135653 there is a very high threat of terrorist attack in somalia
7135654 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu foreigners including australians have been kidnapped
7135655 your kind of children dont look good on our annual report
7135656 at a time when crime involving firearms and other lethal weapons is becoming an issue of public concern i believe scdea officers need the same means to protect themselves as officers in other forces
7135657 i understand the home office has asked the scdea to prioritise operations against gun crime
7135658 this relatively minor provision would provide the scdea with improved operational flexibility and provide armed surveillance capability across scottish forces
7135659 combat nationalism that is always very fast in spreading on these sporting occasions
7135660 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7135661 why on earth is the european commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7135662 their funding should be scrapped and put to better use giving it back to european countries to help their sportsmen is one option that springs to mind
7135663 this is a very cruel thing to foist upon our wonderful athletes who have so proudly flown the flag here
7135664 team gb means great britain on 19 occasions the union flag has been flown at the top of the pole and they have been very proud moments for all the athletes i think this notion that we all get together and fly the eu flag is ridiculous there are 27 countries joined at the hip under the eu but we have all got our individual freedoms to represent our nations at the olympic games
7135665 at the heart of all this is the simple fact that these people want to create a single country called europe
7135666 our westminster politicians try to pretend otherwise but ideas like this let the cat out of the bag
7135667 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7135668 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7135669 consumers are in a lose lose situation where everything is shooting up except their income
7135670 the shock increase in the consumer price index which has more than doubled in the last six months to over twice its official target will impact on everyone this year
7135671 everyone here was in a state of shock when the news came through
7135672 i saw an assistant of helenas who told me she is absolutely numb with grief she cant believe what has happened
7135673 piers is fine he is being discharged later today my ex wife is stable she has a broken collarbone and will be having an operation later today fionas mother brenda bonham carter 74 stepfather francis kirkwood 75 and sister in law kay boardman 54 also died in the accident
7135674 marcus was a thoroughly nice young man absolutely delightful hed been a member of the club for five years and was charming as is his brother piers his father charlie has a house in the area and the family have long associations with the club
7135675 we are all absolutely devastated its been a family wipe out poor fiona has lost her son her mother her stepfather and her sister in law marcus had some very close friends at the club its so very very sad
7135676 cant put into words how much i will miss you you are an amazing person you will never be forgotten r i p marci xxx
7135677 the animals are noisy and i cant stand the stench
7135678 i havent been able to go into my garden since the spring
7135679 you cant choose your neighbours but you expect them to keep to the rules
7135680 we live in the countryside and theres a couple of people around us moaning about chickens they say theres a smell its just the smell of the country
7135681 weve owned chickens for three and a half years and asked neighbours if it was ok
7135682 but ever since mr campaign half of axminster has chickens and everybody is moaning
7135683 more and more people are keeping chickens in urban gardens
7135684 its great to get your own eggs but we are trying to get the message across that you dont need to keep cockerels unless you intend to breed
7135685 if you do we ask that you are considerate to your neighbours
7135686 given the choice of saving meadowbank or getting a knighthood hed choose meadowbank in a flash it means so much to him
7135687 the facility has a great international reputation and cyclists from all over the world come to edin burgh to compete there that is something that the cycle club based out of meadowbank has built up over many years if you lose meadowbank you lose that reputation as well and that will be extremely sad
7135688 there will be a surge of interest towards the sport because of chriss and the teams success yet they want to pull down the facility where he learned his trade
7135689 the club has always welcomed children to come and try the track bikes and support them if they want to take up the sport
7135690 but what will they do when the nearest place is in glasgow instead of pulling the place down they should improve it make it an all weather stadium like the glasgow one is going to be and give new generations of track cyclists a chance to develop into the sports elite like chris has done
7135691 i wouldnt be here with these olympic medals around my neck if meadowbank velodrome didnt exist who knows how many potential olympic athletes there are out there
7135692 its about getting kids on bikes and kids into sport and it would be a shame for the whole of scotland not just edinburgh if we lost the velodrome at meadowbank and didnt build a replacement
7135693 we have to remember scotland will be getting a brand new indoor cycling velodrome in glasgow in time for the commonwealth games which as a country we dont have at the moment and there are currently only two other such facilities in britain
7135694 the comments from the prime minister are extraordinary the scottish fa and indeed the welsh fa have made it clear they will not put at risk their international standing in order to have an under 23 uk team at the next olympics
7135695 the pressure that gordon brown and his ministers are trying to build on this issue is disgraceful and ridiculous
7135696 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7135697 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7135698 we dont want anything to do with a british team and made that clear from very early on
7135699 i have met gordon brown but our position remains the same a team uk would raise questions in terms of our future as an autonomous footballing nation
7135700 right now we have our own association league and national team and that is not something we are willing to compromise
7135701 i dont see a change of heart on this theres no backing for this from our administration or our supporters
7135702 this is a spectacular own goal for brown he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters
7135703 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent
7135704 not only do all the national supporters associations oppose such a move but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team as it could threaten their existence
7135705 when is gordon brown going to realise that nobody wants a team uk a position that could threaten our own independent national side
7135706 to be honest nobody up here takes anything that brown says seriously anymore
7135707 he has proven time and time again that he is more interested in being english than scottish he even admitted to supporting the england team
7135708 scotland is focussed on trying to qualify for world cups and european championships
7135709 in my opinion it would be axiomatic that such a temporary merger could lead to the eventual permanent combination of england scotland northern ireland and wales into a single footballing entity in future major tournaments such as the world cup and european championships
7135710 i think that gordon brown has enough on his plate to start messing up football
7135711 for me football is the best sport in the world so for me it should be top of the list
7135712 it is something im very happy to do i have been lucky enough to wear some of the most beautiful clothes in the world and felt there was no time like the present to support the new generation of british designers through a one off auction of some of my favourite pieces

7135717 neither the democrats nor the republicans have the political will to make the cuts we have to make
7135718 the reality is were heading for an economic catastrophe we have to reduce spending im the only candidate who will
7135719 not only does the expansion need to stop we need to have a reversal of entitlements
7135720 if youre not going to give people free food and free shelter why should you give them free health care
7135721 it was based on deception and i think it will make our fiscal and terrorism problems worse
7135722 my solutions work and they involve sacrifice but not real pain
7135723 if we wait another five or 10 years they will involve pain the sooner we act the better
7135724 in 2004 it was a real long shot its less of a long shot now
7135725 if you had gone back to 1928 and told people things are going to get a lot worse in the next few years unless we act now they would have said youre crazy
7135726 but this is not like 1928 where you didnt have the picture painted for you its there its just a matter of whether you want to look at the painting

7135751 over the course of the next few minutes the vehicle is seen a number of times in the neighbourhood by a number of police members and there are some attempts made to stop the vehicle
7135752 all this is subject to investigation but we know that our police member discharged a firearm at the driver of the vehicle the vehicle carried on for a short distance about a block and a 34 year old male was taken into custody and then immediately taken to hospital by ems for treatment of serious injuries
7135753 its an injury sustained in this incident but not firearm involved he wasnt shot
7135754 they may not have a complete picture of what occurred but they may be able to add a very pertinent piece of information
7135755 we need to do an investigation that looks into use of force by a police officer using a firearm that causes injury
7135756 people starting up a scrap metal business need to be aware if they are carrying waste they must be licensed to do so they cant just start up
7135757 we have also been getting complaints over the noise from the bugles and reports dealers are visiting the same streets three times a week or more
7135758 its a slower pace of life and you see lots of different parts of the country you have a different back garden each night
7135759 you get to know friendly people and everyone helps everyone else its like life as it used to be
7135760 you dont get any traffic jams well not many and when you go under the motorways you see all the cars going past so fast and youre going underneath so slowly
7135761 that includes visitors and there will be 250 campers who will be coming down
7135762 the core of the committee is made up of 18 members but over the last four weeks there have probably been about 100 of us on site were all volunteers
7135763 its like being in a workplace where you meet like minded people
7135764 we have had to get a crane on the site to lift some of the boats we have also got a huge exhibition hall marquee which is done up with lots of stalls and there is also a marquee where we will be having cookery demonstrations
7135765 it costs 250 000 to stage the festival and we have a commercial director who has to deal with all the exhibitors and their stalls and because this time were in the middle of a residential area you have to consult with local people
7135766 i think that is the same for a lot of people when you have done it you find there is nothing else like it
7135767 we had a young family then and its the kind of holiday you can take children on theres things to do and things to see and the children do without the television when we came back from our first holiday we thought we will do that again and it went from there
7135768 i started coming to the festivals as a volunteer about 10 years ago doing something menial like making the sandwiches and somehow i ended up doing more and more as you near retirement you can give it a bit more help
7135769 it doesnt have one of those noisy chugging engines it is pretty quiet and we have a washing machine and a coal fire
7135770 we have most of our home comforts really just a little less space
7135771 you need to use your boat to make it worthwhile as they are expensive to buy you have got to maintain your engine and the bottom of the boat has to be blacked up every two to three years as well
7135772 its a canal system that isnt used fully a lot of the boats which go through the locks then go out of the area
7135773 unless you stop and look you dont actually know what it is like
7135774 during the beijing olympics i have been on the edge of my seat watching birchfield harriers such as kelly sotherton and julie hollman take part in the heptathlon
7135775 if the games had been in europe we would have all gathered at the club to watch them compete
7135776 but with the games taking place on the other side of the world we had to watch when we could and cheer them along on our own
7135777 the first olympian we had was archie robertson who was a very good cyclist and joined the club in 1907
7135778 he took part in the 1908 games and won gold in the the three mile team race and silver in the steeplechase
7135779 also the birchfield harriers had eight members in the famous chariots of fire team of 1924 in paris
7135780 the clubs first lady olympian was audrey kilner brown who won silver in the 4 x 100 metres relay in the 1936 games in berlin
7135781 since audrey we have had dozens of excellent women athletes go to the olympics including denise lewis and katharine merry
7135782 in 2000 when they both came back from the games in sydney the atmosphere in the west midlands was electric it is a year i will never forget
7135783 at the end it was felt by some that the race should have been re run
7135784 as a result a group of dissatisfied cross country runners agreed to meet to discuss the formation of their own athletics club
7135785 birchfield harriers came into existence and they were the first athletics club to own their own track with a paid administrator
7135786 our present track is owned by birmingham city council as the alexander stadium was built in the 1970s when the council had hopes of holding the commonwealth games
7135787 we have the aga academy for youngsters from nine to 15 years old and who knows we could find the next denise lewis or archie robertson
7135788 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7135789 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7135790 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7135791 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7135792 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating

7135802 god has always had his specialists who appeared at critical moments in history to reprove rebuke and exhort in the name of god and righteousness such a man was likely to be drastic radical possibly at times violent and the curious crowd that gathered to watch him work soon branded him as extreme fanatical and negative and in a sense they were right he was single minded severe and fearless because these were the qualities the circumstances demanded
7135803 i was born to fight devils and factions it is my business to remove obstructions cut down thorns fill up quagmires and make straight paths but if i have a failing let it be that i speak the truth with too great a severity than to act as a hypocrite and conceal the truth

7135812 the only good thing about bowman is that it provides secure communications but what is the point of that if it doesnt work we could end up with a situation where soldiers are being killed or injured because of communication problems
7135813 bowman has many advantages over its predecessor system but the harsh conditions and challenging terrain under which it operates in southern afghanistan would seriously stretch the performance of any modern digital radio communications tua mappa con az proj

7135836 the rs spyder was very quick this afternoon and i was pushing to the maximum to get the lmp2 pole i made no mistakes and was not slowed by any traffic so the results were good and the track record our new dfi direct fuel injection engine has to get the credit for that as the power over a bigger range and the increased horsepower gave us greater speed
7135837 we are well prepared to start from the second row our nearest competitor in the point championship is behind us the race will be decided by who gets the least damage from incidents with the prototypes we need to be really conscious that the prototypes are racing hard and we are racing hard there is the high risk of getting contact because of that i believe this track gives the best chance of an incident because the speed difference in the corners is maximum the prototypes are lighter with more downforce so they are much quicker in the corners and these are all really high downforce corners i think in the end it will be like the last race at road america where it was really tight we dont need to win we just need to make the points gap smaller so that is our main goal for tomorrow
7135838 i had a really productive morning with dave fullerton engineer making more changes on the car we went the right way jim nailed our goal for qualifying the car and i couldnt be happier about that it sets us up really well for tomorrows race
7135839 i was very pleased with what i have accomplished this week as a driver to get my times closer to what they need to be i owe a lot of that to my team dave fullerton engineer alex and mike zimicki driving coach especially to get the parts of this puzzle on how to get this done obviously we all want to go faster i am pleased with my result and the help i have been getting from my team
7135840 it seems it didnt hurt us too much that we didnt test here it took us a long time to get adapted to the track because its so difficult and so special with all the blind turns but we improved the car every practice session we developed the car in the right direction and the qualifying result shows that we are able to put a fast car on every track it seems were on a high right now
7135841 i have no problems mentally to drive a porsche i drove two rsrs in the n rburgring 24 hour race so i know the car
7135842 and of course that horst is technical director is in my opinion the best he knows everything about dirk and myself so i am really looking forward to the mosport race
7135843 after the terrible weekend allan mcnish and i had at the n rburgring it is so nice to be back in a top position for me this pole is really special because i could not run in the session before qualifying i was a little bit afraid but on my first flying lap i understood that the car was good and a like it i had just to push i had a big power slide out of the last corner and i was afraid that this could have cost me the pole but at the end it was good enough
7135844 we could not hope for more we have both cars in front both dindo capello and marco werner did a really extraordinary job to put both audis on the front row on this track which is normally not the best for us is really exceptional we are very happy with the set up for the race we start from the best position let s just hope it will not rain tomorrow
7135845 i am actually quite satisfied marco werner is of course a bit disappointed because definitely more would have been possible we ve all seen that but that s racing sometimes you are lucky sometimes unlucky our day was tough but good after what happened yesterday we can be happy with second position on the grid we have a good car for the race i m looking forward for tomorrow
7135846 of course we are satisfied to have both cars on the front row personally i ve a fairly thick neck because of mister montagny who cost me two tenths of a second this would have been pole but the most important thing is we have both audis in front
7135847 it was a great team effort especially after what happened yesterday both cars were back in good shape for qualifying and both drivers did a fantastic job congratulations to the drivers and the whole team for their hard work
7135848 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7135849 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7135850 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7135851 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7135852 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7135853 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7135854 that little 10 mph wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer

7135860 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7135861 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7135862 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7135863 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7135864 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7135865 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7135866 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7135867 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7135868 they said coach you dont yell we know when you say something you want us to do it
7135869 ive never had a winning season from middle school on im kind of hoping to accomplish that
7135870 were hoping to come out with a good record get some wins its our last year
7135871 we havent had good years in the past last year we had two so hopefully were gonna build on that and do better this season
7135872 i told the boys when i took over that were gonna start at step one i could throw offenses in there and defenses in there but youve got to have the technique and why were doing it and right now theyre picking it up
7135873 ive got a futurologist with me tonight so that means youre an expert on the future
7135874 well just technology in my case not the whole future thatd be rather a lot

7135881 mommy tara asked me if you ever talk bad about her
7135882 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jamas estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro
7135883 si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada das schwerste gewicht pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad
7135884 pero es de verdad terrible el peso y maravillosa la levedad
7135885 la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes
7135886 entonces qu hemos de elegir el peso o la levedad
7135887 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
7135888 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
7135889 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
7135890 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
7135891 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
7135892 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
7135893 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
7135894 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
7135895 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7135896 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7135897 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7135898 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7135899 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7135900 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7135901 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him

7135925 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7135926 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7135927 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class

7135934 lovinsky pierre antoine graduated in psychology from the haitian state university and obtained further specialisation on child psychology in montreal canada he has been involved for several years as a grass roots community organizer mainly working with children in the early 1990s he co founded the foundation for the support of children fondsayon kore timoun yo for young street children in port au prince and a centre for teenage mothers foyer pour m res adolescentes
7135935 we can only come to the conclusion that the u n is not really interested in finding lovinsky if they wanted to find out what happened to lovinsky they have the capacity to do so people around the world have taken up the cause to find him and we can only assume that these forces in charge of haiti right now dont want a voice like lovinskys to be heard
7135936 i know it was a difficult decision for lovinsky because he knew the risks and he had a family that he loved but in the end lovinsky felt he could not stay out of haiti any longer that he was needed to help organize progressive grassroots voices in haiti
7135937 i last saw lovinsky in person in february 2007 at the time he was receiving threats and frequently changing where he slept he knew he was in danger but also knew that in haitis democratic transition that the traditional forces would have the upper hand he knew that if the people did not organize life would become more difficult for the majority of haitians who are poor
7135938 i have not heard of any report from any haitian authorities on lovinskys disappearance despite requests from lovinskys family fondasyon trant septanm members of the u s congress and human rights and haiti solidarity activists from around the world
7135939 we also know that the police have repeatedly failed to follow up on leads they have been provided it is hard to escape the conclusion that the haitian government is not reporting on its investigation because it is not conducting one
7135940 calling for the authorities to ensure wilson mesiliens protection in accordance with his wishes
7135941 i cannot explain why lovinsky was left out of the working groups report the un mission in haiti issued a press release about it the abduction was in the news amnesty international and other human rights groups issued action alerts the omission was especially troubling because lovinsky was such a high profile human rights activist and candidate for the senate elections

7136055 however the fastest growing area of cosmetic surgery has been minimally invasive procedures such as botox injections which have soared over the last decade

7136057 people are thinking maybe im going to see my husband or my son or my sister walking the street after shes dead thats not the case
7136058 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure was not without complications
7136059 however promising results could mean that this procedure might be an option for long term restoration of severe facial disfigurement
7136060 youre dealing with a patient that has no more face
7136061 they have no more face and no more human appearance what were trying to do is give them back human appearance
7136062 what were doing is trying to repair those patients but we need donors
7136063 the point here is that by having these patients fed you have those options
7136064 each patient and each situation is different but from our study we found that early feeding in patients undergoing abdominoplasty was clearly feasible and safe
7136065 i think like many things in medicine we see incremental changes in behavior in surgery and very often it is not a paradigm shift that taken together can advance the science of surgery
7136066 i believe that many surgeons may even be using this approach already
7136067 the group that we compared where we did not feed them the patients has made me a believer
7136068 this is probably because these patients may be uncomfortable might not want to eat may be fearful of eating post op or may be tired here it is important to continue their i v but in those patients who want to eat and can maintain adequate hydration it allows them to
7136069 this procedure will open up a tremendous opportunity for patients who have lost the ability to move and breathe on their own without the aid of a respirator due to spinal cord injury or disease or damage to the phrenic nerve
7136070 it marks the first time that nerve restoration surgery has been used to free permanent prisoners of a ventilator from their misery
7136071 pacing the phrenic nerve is not new per se it has been done for more than 20 years on patients with an intact phrenic nerve but in whom the spinal cord is not sending appropriate signals
7136072 this trial however marks the first time nerve transfers have been used to re animate the phrenic nerve in patients with damage to the nerve itself or with damage to the nerve cells in the spinal cord
7136073 breathing through a ventilator wears on the body and makes quadriplegics more susceptible to fever infections and pneumonia the primary case of death in quadriplegics
7136074 this procedure eliminates the brute force of the ventilator and reproduces the smoothness of the natural breathing process thereby prolonging the lifespan of many quadriplegics
7136075 given the success of this research i plan to look at ways to use this technique to make the phrenic nerve procedure a quicker safer and more routine operation so that more patients will be eligible to receive its benefits

7136077 smaller women are going to have proportionally smaller breasts but for their particular frame their breasts may still be far too large and uncomfortable
7136078 our concern is that with predicted growth and interest in the broad spectrum of cosmetic procedures patients will look to the closest easiest solution
7136079 potential patients however need to know that board certified plastic surgeons are uniquely qualified with an in depth medical knowledge of the entire human body they have the training necessary to accurately assess your individual needs and map health and beauty goals for your entire lifetime

7136083 the standard way physicians do a diagnosis now is to cut out a mole and look at a slice of it with a microscope
7136084 what were trying to do is find cancer signals they can get to without having to cut out the mole
7136085 this is the first approach that can target molecules like hemoglobin and melanin and get microscopic resolution images the equivalent of what a doctor would see if he or she were able to slice down to that particular point
7136086 fda has reviewed an extensive amount of data from clinical trials of women studied for up to four years as well as a wealth of other information to determine the benefits and risks of these products
7136087 the extensive body of scientific evidence provides reasonable assurance of the benefits and risks of these devices this information is available in the product labeling and will enable women and their physicians to make informed decisions
7136088 the silicone breast implant is one of the most extensively studied medical devices
7136089 we now have a good understanding of what complications can occur and at what rates we also know that women who get these devices will probably need to have additional breast implant surgery at least once this is valuable information for women who may be considering these products

7136093 this study demonstrates that early feeding of tummy tuck patients may prevent the need for postoperative hospital admission for intravenous hydration at least in those patients who can maintain adequate hydration with oral intake alone and allow for faster hospital discharge
7136094 while there may be other reasons for admission routine postoperative admission to prevent dehydration may not be necessary these findings could change the way we care for our postoperative plastic surgery patients improving their comfort and safety and saving on health care costs
7136095 bariatric surgery is a useful tool for treating obesity and many patients benefit from completing their weight loss journey with plastic surgery every year however the data shows that more patients could be helped by these procedures
7136096 major obstacles to surgery for patients include cost difficulty in receiving insurance coverage and reluctance to have additional surgery
7136097 this is serious surgery that may involve multiple procedures performed over many months significant recovery time and a financial commitment however the benefits are incredibly positive
7136098 removing excess skin is not only necessary to achieve optimal body shape but its also helpful in improving overall health and quality of life because of these benefits and the rising number of bariatric procedures being preformed we expect to see a continued increase in the number of patients who have these procedures

7136137 siapakah yang percaya kepada berita yang kami dengar dan kepada siapakah tangan kekuasaan tuhan dinyatakan sebagai taruk ia tumbuh di hadapan tuhan dan sebagai tunas dari tanah kering ia tidak tampan dan semaraknyapun tidak ada sehingga kita memandang dia dan rupapun tidak sehingga kita menginginkannya ia dihina dan dihindari orang seorang yang penuh kesengsaraan dan yang biasa menderita kesakitan ia sangat dihina sehingga orang menutup mukanya terhadap dia dan bagi kitapun dia tidak masuk hitungan tetapi sesungguhnya penyakit kitalah yang ditanggungnya dan kesengsaraan kita yang dipikulnya padahal kita mengira dia kena tulah dipukul dan ditindas allah tetapi dia tertikam oleh karena pemberontakan kita dia diremukkan oleh karena kejahatan kita ganjaran yang mendatangkan keselamatan bagi kita ditimpakan kepadanya dan oleh bilur bilurnya kita menjadi sembuh kita sekalian sesat seperti domba masing masing kita mengambil jalannya sendiri tetapi tuhan telah menimpakan kepadanya kejahatan kita sekalian dia dianiaya tetapi dia membiarkan diri ditindas dan tidak membuka mulutnya seperti anak domba yang dibawa ke pembantaian seperti induk domba yang kelu di depan orang orang yang menggunting bulunya ia tidak membuka mulutnya sesudah penahanan dan penghukuman ia terambil dan tentang nasibnya siapakah yang memikirkannya sungguh ia terputus dari negeri orang orang hidup dan karena pemberontakan umat ku ia kena tulah orang menempatkan kuburnya di antara orang orang fasik dan dalam matinya ia ada di antara penjahat penjahat sekalipun ia tidak berbuat kekerasan dan tipu tidak ada dalam mulutnya tetapi tuhan berkehendak meremukkan dia dengan kesakitan apabila ia menyerahkan dirinya sebagai korban penebus salah ia akan melihat keturunannya umurnya akan lanjut dan kehendak tuhan akan terlaksana olehnya sesudah kesusahan jiwanya ia akan melihat terang dan menjadi puas dan hamba ku itu sebagai orang yang benar akan membenarkan banyak orang oleh hikmatnya dan kejahatan mereka dia pikul sebab itu aku akan membagikan kepadanya orang orang besar sebagai rampasan dan ia akan memperoleh orang orang kuat sebagai jarahan yaitu sebagai ganti karena ia telah menyerahkan nyawanya ke dalam maut dan karena ia terhitung di antara pemberontak pemberontak sekalipun ia menanggung dosa banyak orang dan berdoa untuk pemberontak pemberontak
7136138 dia yang tidak mengenal dosa telah dibuat nya menjadi dosa karena kita supaya dalam dia kita dibenarkan oleh allah
7136139 karena waktu kita masih lemah kristus telah mati untuk kita orang orang durhaka pada waktu yang ditentukan oleh allah sebab tidak mudah seorang mau mati untuk orang yang benar tetapi mungkin untuk orang yang baik ada orang yang berani mati akan tetapi allah menunjukkan kasih nya kepada kita oleh karena kristus telah mati untuk kita ketika kita masih berdosa lebih lebih karena kita sekarang telah dibenarkan oleh darah nya kita pasti akan diselamatkan dari murka allah sebab jikalau kita ketika masih seteru diperdamaikan dengan allah oleh kematian anak nya lebih lebih kita yang sekarang telah diperdamaikan pasti akan diselamatkan oleh hidup nya dan bukan hanya itu saja kita malah bermegah dalam allah oleh yesus kristus tuhan kita sebab oleh dia kita telah menerima pendamaian itu hubungan yang dipulihkan
7136140 sebab itu sama seperti oleh satu pelanggaran semua orang beroleh penghukuman demikian pula oleh satu perbuatan kebenaran semua orang beroleh pembenaran untuk hidup jadi sama seperti oleh ketidaktaatan satu orang semua orang telah menjadi orang berdosa demikian pula oleh ketaatan satu orang semua orang menjadi orang benar tetapi hukum taurat ditambahkan supaya pelanggaran menjadi semakin banyak dan di mana dosa bertambah banyak di sana kasih karunia menjadi berlimpah limpah supaya sama seperti dosa berkuasa dalam alam maut demikian kasih karunia akan berkuasa oleh kebenaran untuk hidup yang kekal oleh yesus kristus tuhan kita
7136141 bawalah aku berjalan dalam kebenaran mu dan ajarlah aku sebab engkaulah allah yang menyelamatkan aku engkau kunanti nantikan sepanjang hari
7136142 haleluya karena tuhan allah kita yang mahakuasa telah menjadi raja 19 7 marilah kita bersukacita dan bersorak sorai dan memuliakan dia karena hari perkawinan anak domba yesus kristus telah tiba dan pengantin nya jemaat telah siap sedia 19 8 kepadanya dikaruniakan supaya memakai kain lenan halus yang berkilau kilauan dan putih bersih
7136143 tuliskanlah berbahagialah mereka yang diundang ke perjamuan kawin anak domba
7136144 janganlah berbuat demikian aku adalah hamba sama dengan engkau dan saudara saudara seimanmu yang memiliki kesaksian yesus sembahlah allah karena kesaksian yesus adalah roh nubuat
7136145 marilah ke sini dan berkumpullah untuk turut dalam perjamuan allah perjamuan yang besar alkitab adalah firman allah yang telah
7136146 milikilah cara hidup yang baik di tengah tengah bangsa bangsa bukan yahudi supaya apabila mereka memfitnah kamu sebagai orang durjana mereka dapat melihatnya dari perbuatan perbuatanmu yang baik dan memuliakan allah pada hari ia melawat mereka
7136147 hendaklah kamu sehati sepikir dalam hidupmu bersama janganlah kamu memikirkan perkara perkara yang tinggi tetapi arahkanlah dirimu kepada perkara perkara yang sederhana janganlah menganggap dirimu pandai janganlah membalas kejahatan dengan kejahatan lakukanlah apa yang baik bagi semua orang sedapat dapatnya kalau hal itu bergantung padamu hiduplah dalam perdamaian dengan semua orang saudara saudaraku yang kekasih janganlah kamu sendiri menuntut pembalasan tetapi berilah tempat kepada murka allah sebab ada tertulis pembalasan itu adalah hak ku akulah yang akan menuntut pembalasan firman tuhan tetapi jika seterumu lapar berilah dia makan jika ia haus berilah dia minum dengan berbuat demikian kamu menumpukkan bara api di atas kepalanya janganlah kamu kalah terhadap kejahatan tetapi kalahkanlah kejahatan dengan kebaikan
7136148 hindarilah soal soal yang dicari cari yang bodoh dan tidak layak engkau tahu bahwa soal soal itu menimbulkan pertengkaran sedangkan seorang hamba tuhan tidak boleh bertengkar tetapi harus ramah terhadap semua orang ia harus cakap mengajar sabar dan dengan lemah lembut dapat menuntun orang yang suka melawan sebab mungkin tuhan memberikan kesempatan kepada mereka untuk bertobat dan memimpin mereka sehingga mereka mengenal kebenaran dan dengan demikian mereka menjadi sadar kembali karena terlepas dari jerat iblis yang telah mengikat mereka pada kehendaknya
7136149 di dalam kasih tidak ada ketakutan kasih yang sempurna melenyapkan ketakutan
7136150 dan janganlah kamu takut kepada mereka yang dapat membunuh tubuh tetapi yang tidak berkuasa membunuh jiwa takutlah terutama kepada dia yang berkuasa membinasakan baik jiwa maupun tubuh di dalam neraka
7136151 tetapi kepada kamu yang mendengarkan aku aku berkata kasihilah musuhmu berbuatlah baik kepada orang yang membenci kamu
7136152 jikalau dunia membenci kamu ingatlah bahwa ia telah lebih dahulu membenci aku dari pada kamu sekiranya kamu dari dunia tentulah dunia mengasihi kamu sebagai miliknya tetapi karena kamu bukan dari dunia melainkan aku telah memilih kamu dari dunia sebab itulah dunia membenci kamu ingatlah apa yang telah kukatakan kepadamu seorang hamba tidaklah lebih tinggi dari pada tuannya jikalau mereka telah menganiaya aku mereka juga akan menganiaya kamu jikalau mereka telah menuruti firman ku mereka juga akan menuruti perkataanmu tetapi semuanya itu akan mereka lakukan terhadap kamu karena nama ku sebab mereka tidak mengenal dia yang telah mengutus aku
7136153 dan kami telah melihat dan bersaksi bahwa bapa telah mengutus anak nya menjadi juruselamat dunia barangsiapa mengaku bahwa yesus adalah anak allah allah tetap berada di dalam dia dan dia di dalam allah
7136154 they think that im going to get hurt theyre wishing i would quit im not ready to quit
7136155 i love it its just its hard to explain but when you get on it and get out there and ride on it its just a feeling that its just something i love to do its a part of me its been all my life i guess
7136156 id have to ride when it got sort of dark at night and id push it out on the road
7136157 i think its all due to the speed they just have to slow down
7136158 about 50 miles per hour is ok but not 80
7136159 tuhan allah kita tuhan itu esa kasihilah tuhan allahmu dengan segenap hatimu dan dengan segenap jiwamu dan dengan segenap akal budimu dan dengan segenap kekuatanmu
7136160 tidak ada allah lain dari pada allah yang esa yaitu bapa yang dari pada nya berasal segala sesuatu dan yang untuk dia kita hidup dan satu tuhan saja yaitu yesus kristus yang oleh nya segala sesuatu telah dijadikan dan yang karena dia kita hidup
7136161 jangan takut hai maria sebab engkau beroleh kasih karunia di hadapan allah sesungguhnya engkau akan mengandung dan akan melahirkan seorang anak laki laki dan hendaklah engkau menamai dia yesus ia akan menjadi besar dan akan disebut anak allah yang mahatinggi dan tuhan allah akan mengaruniakan kepada nya takhta daud bapa leluhur nya dan ia akan menjadi raja atas kaum keturunan yakub sampai selama lamanya dan kerajaan nya tidak akan berkesudahan
7136162 roh kudus akan turun atasmu dan kuasa allah yang mahatinggi akan menaungi engkau sebab itu anak yang akan kaulahirkan itu akan disebut kudus anak allah
7136163 setelah pada zaman dahulu allah berulang kali dan dalam pelbagai cara berbicara kepada nenek moyang kita dengan perantaraan nabi nabi maka pada zaman akhir ini ia telah berbicara kepada kita dengan perantaraan anak nya yang telah ia tetapkan sebagai yang berhak menerima segala yang ada oleh dia allah telah menjadikan alam semesta ia adalah cahaya kemuliaan allah dan gambar wujud allah dan menopang segala yang ada dengan firman nya yang penuh kekuasaan dan setelah ia selesai mengadakan penyucian dosa ia duduk di sebelah kanan yang mahabesar di tempat yang tinggi
7136164 dan kami telah melihat dan bersaksi bahwa bapa telah mengutus anak nya menjadi juruselamat dunia barangsiapa mengaku bahwa yesus adalah anak allah allah tetap berada di dalam dia dan dia di dalam allah
7136165 setelah yesus tiba di daerah kaisarea filipi ia bertanya kepada murid murid nya
7136166 ada yang mengatakan yohanes pembaptis ada juga yang mengatakan elia dan ada pula yang mengatakan yeremia atau salah seorang dari para nabi
7136167 berbahagialah engkau simon bin yunus sebab bukan manusia yang menyatakan itu kepadamu melainkan bapa ku yang di sorga
7136168 ya tuhan aku percaya bahwa engkaulah mesias anak allah dia yang akan datang ke dalam dunia
7136169 kepala pasukan dan prajurit prajuritnya yang menjaga yesus menjadi sangat takut ketika mereka melihat gempa bumi dan apa yang telah terjadi lalu berkata
7136170 tetapi tomas seorang dari kedua belas murid itu yang disebut didimus tidak ada bersama sama mereka ketika yesus datang ke situ
7136171 sebelum aku melihat bekas paku pada tangan nya dan sebelum aku mencucukkan jariku ke dalam bekas paku itu dan mencucukkan tanganku ke dalam lambung nya sekali kali aku tidak akan percaya
7136172 taruhlah jarimu di sini dan lihatlah tangan ku ulurkanlah tanganmu dan cucukkan ke dalam lambung ku dan jangan engkau tidak percaya lagi melainkan percayalah
7136173 karena engkau telah melihat aku maka engkau percaya berbahagialah mereka yang tidak melihat namun percaya
7136174 sebab itu orang orang yahudi lebih berusaha lagi untuk membunuh nya bukan saja karena ia meniadakan hari sabat tetapi juga karena ia mengatakan bahwa allah adalah bapa nya sendiri dan dengan demikian menyamakan diri nya dengan allah
7136175 aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya anak tidak dapat mengerjakan sesuatu dari diri nya sendiri jikalau tidak ia melihat bapa mengerjakannya sebab apa yang dikerjakan bapa itu juga yang dikerjakan anak sebab bapa mengasihi anak dan ia menunjukkan kepada nya segala sesuatu yang dikerjakan nya sendiri bahkan ia akan menunjukkan kepada nya pekerjaan pekerjaan yang lebih besar lagi dari pada pekerjaan pekerjaan itu sehingga kamu menjadi heran sebab sama seperti bapa membangkitkan orang orang mati dan menghidupkannya demikian juga anak menghidupkan barangsiapa yang dikehendaki nya bapa tidak menghakimi siapapun melainkan telah menyerahkan penghakiman itu seluruhnya kepada anak supaya semua orang menghormati anak sama seperti mereka menghormati bapa barangsiapa tidak menghormati anak ia juga tidak menghormati bapa yang mengutus dia aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya barangsiapa mendengar perkataan ku dan percaya kepada dia yang mengutus aku ia mempunyai hidup yang kekal dan tidak turut dihukum sebab ia sudah pindah dari dalam maut ke dalam hidup
7136176 akulah dia dan kamu akan melihat anak manusia duduk di sebelah kanan yang mahakuasa dan datang di tengah tengah awan awan di langit
7136177 kita menerima kesaksian manusia tetapi kesaksian allah lebih kuat sebab demikianlah kesaksian yang diberikan allah tentang anak nya barangsiapa percaya kepada anak allah ia mempunyai kesaksian itu di dalam dirinya barangsiapa tidak percaya kepada allah ia membuat dia menjadi pendusta karena ia tidak percaya akan kesaksian yang diberikan allah tentang anak nya dan inilah kesaksian itu allah telah mengaruniakan hidup yang kekal kepada kita dan hidup itu ada di dalam anak nya barangsiapa memiliki anak ia memiliki hidup barangsiapa tidak memiliki anak ia tidak memiliki hidup semuanya itu kutuliskan kepada kamu supaya kamu yang percaya kepada nama anak allah tahu bahwa kamu memiliki hidup yang kekal
7136178 karena begitu besar kasih allah akan dunia ini sehingga ia telah mengaruniakan anak nya yang tunggal supaya setiap orang yang percaya kepada nya tidak binasa melainkan beroleh hidup yang kekal sebab allah mengutus anak nya ke dalam dunia bukan untuk menghakimi dunia melainkan untuk menyelamatkannya oleh dia barangsiapa percaya kepada nya ia tidak akan dihukum barangsiapa tidak percaya ia telah berada di bawah hukuman sebab ia tidak percaya dalam nama anak tunggal allah
7136179 dan tidak seorang diantara kamu melainkan mendatanginya masuk neraka dan ini bagi tuhanmu adalah ketetapan yang sudah dipastikan

7136194 bukanlah aku yang pertama diantara rasul rasul dan aku tidak mengetahui apa yang akan diperbuat terhadapku dan terhadap kamu
7136195 sesungguhnya allah dan malaikat malaikat nya bersolawat untuk nabi hai orang orang yang beriman hendaklah kamu memohon rahmat dan keselamatan untuk nabi dan ucapkanlah salam penghormatan kepadanya qs 33 al ahzaab golongan yang bersekutu 56
7136196 seseorang datang kepadaku dari tuhanku membawa berita mungkin katanya membawa brita gembira
7136197 mendekatlah dan berusahalah benar ketahuilah bahwa setiap orang diantara kalian tidak bakal selamat karena amalnya
7136198 tidak juga aku kecuali bila allah melimpahiku dengan rahmat dan karunia dari nya
7136199 tak seorangpun diantara kalian dimasukkan oleh amalnya ke dalam surga dan tidak pula diselamatkan dari neraka begitu pula aku kecuali dengan rahmat dari allah hadits shohih muslim oleh kh adib basri mustafa hal 819 no 77
7136200 sebab karena kasih karunia rahmat allah red diselamatkan oleh iman itu bukan hasil usahamu tetapi pemberian allah
7136201 bagaimana akan ada bagiku seorang anak laki laki sedang tidak pernah seorang manusiapun menyentuhku dan aku bukan pula seorang pezinah
7136202 hal itu adalah mudah bagiku dan agar dapat kami menjadikannya suatu tanda bagi manusia dan sebagai rahmat dari kami dan hal ini itu adalah suatu perkara yang sudah diputuskan
7136203 dan sesungguhnya isa itu benar memberikan pengetahuan tentang hari kiamat karena itu janganlah kamu ragu tentang hari kiamat itu dan ikutlah aku itulah jalan yang lurus
7136204 namanya almasih isa putera maryam seorang yang terkemuka di dunia dan akhirat dan salah satu daripada orang orang yang dekat kepada allah qs 3 ali imraan keluarga imran 45
7136205 sesungguhnya isa almasih putera maryam itu utusan allah dan firman nya
7136206 hai isa sesungguhnya aku akan mewafatkanmu dan mengangkatmu kepada ku dan akan mensucikan engkau dari orang orang kafir dan menjadikan orang orang yang mengikutimu diatas mereka yang kafir hingga hari kiamat
7136207 demi allah yang jiwaku ditangan nya sesungguhnya telah dekat masanya isa anak maryam akan turun ditengah kamu
7136208 ada jalan yang disangka orang lurus tetapi ujungnya menuju maut
7136209 sebab mesias mesias palsu dan nabi nabi palsu akan muncul dan mereka akan mengadakan tanda tanda yang dahsyat dan mujizat mujizat sehingga sekiranya mungkin mereka menyesatkan orang orang yang terpilih juga
7136210 hanya isa anak maryam yang langsung masuk surga kerana dia suci
7136211 manusia tidak pernah tahu dan tidak bisa menebak apakah kelak ia akan masuk surga atau neraka terkecuali atas izin nya

7136216 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
7136217 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
7136218 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
7136219 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
7136220 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe

7136224 the alt weeklies and local papers were full of syndicated content
7136225 even if it was local there was not an actual opinion
7136226 we dont have 500 people working out of some office we value the individual voice
7136227 i want to know what my neighbor thinks is the best sandwich in town
7136228 but our focus has always been on building a cool site
7136229 of course there are people who want to know how we did

7136236 hi everybody my name is real so i am kinda related to the cheetah girls i dont know how but i
7136237 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration

7136241 radio 1 auch vor allem dann wenn sie sich keine richtige sendefrequenz leisten k nnen und die ard verdient daran ja gut denn in deutschland sind dank webradio f r den internetzugang
7136242 radio 1 auch nicht von der auffallend hohen qualit t dieses senders
7136243 i am definitely focusing on my own thing but in my opinion the phish thing is pretty likely at this point because people are so healthy and enthusiastic about it among the band members the vibe is really good
7136244 this is not a ticket who will garner the support of the majority of american people
7136245 the obama campaign remains committed to georgia as evidenced by the 27 offices we have opened across the state as of today
7136246 the mccain campaign has yet to open their first there is enormous enthusiasm here for the obama biden ticket because georgians know they cant afford four more years of the failed bush policies that john mccain is offering
7136247 he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7136248 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for senator obama in the campaign and in the white house
7136249 the choice of my good friend senator joe biden as barack obamas vice presidential running mate is great news for michigan senator biden is a strong fighter for the auto industry and american manufacturing jobs he played an instrumental role in helping chrysler in the 1980s and in his strong support for our efforts to keep auto jobs in america today
7136250 joe biden said it best and its something we agree with that barack obama is not ready to be president i think that he will help make our case
7136251 i agree with joe biden when he said he did not think barack obama was ready to be president and that the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training i also do not believe that the addition of an east coast liberal senator to provide on the job training to obama on foreign affairs will do anything to help michigan tackle the difficult economic challenges we face
7136252 presidential candidate barack obama picks a running mate ready for the job sen joe biden of delaware not only is a man with working class roots but he has an extensive record of working in washington senator biden brings vital foreign policy experience this is a man who knows how to get the job done it is well known that he has an impressive record of collaborating across party lines this is definitely a good choice for the democratic party
7136253 i am not sure whether senator barack obama made the best political move in choosing senator joe biden as his vice president hillary clinton would have probably helped more
7136254 im not sure if it is a good pick or a bad one or just kind of neutral
7136255 look we think joe biden is kind of funny too but uh come the fuck on ap and cnn and everybody do you really want this biden he is smart he knows some things he would be great on a new yorker podcast or whatever but eh time for bed finally
7136256 biden may not have been the perfect choice he may not even have been the preferred choice but he was at least to obamas view the necessary choice
7136257 all things being equal obama could have done a whole lot worse
7136258 i gather that obama realizes that he needed a pick that would demonstrate some level of intellectual seriousness about the condition of the world
7136259 it has been lonely and sometimes it is hard england seemed like a relatively stable country but now the price of things is going up and we have to work harder just to keep going
7136260 so many poles came to the uk the polish government needs to do more they have a responsibility to protect their citizens
7136261 i want to make sure that the polish government realises there are a lot of citizens here and they need to make sure their investments in the embassy and consulate are appropriate
7136262 depression is a big problem for poles living in britain
7136263 we try to support them somehow but there are no special services
7136264 there is a lot of public interest in additional measures against the regime in zimbabwe
7136265 one angle is financial centred on current zimbabwean legislation that requires banks to surrender part of their foreign currency to the government see coverage inter alia in the independent on sunday yesterday
7136266 we discussed this at this mornings whitehall zimbabwe crisis meeting
7136267 were looking into how uk businesses with links to zimbabwe can help how can we encourage an ethical approach from british businesses inc banks or their subsidiaries trading in with zimbabwe what leverage do we have over the behaviour of british businesses and how can we apply it most effectively
7136268 it is to be hoped that uk companies are not directly complicit or beneficially complicit in human rights abuses some may however be silently complicit by failing to raise the question of systematic or continuous human rights violations in their interactions with the appropriate authorities
7136269 for example inaction or acceptance by companies of systematic discrimination in employment law against particular groups which in the context of zimbabwe might be interpreted as those opposed to mugabe
7136270 hoping that companies would abide by an optional code flies in the face of experience and the government should know that that is the case
7136271 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7136272 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7136273 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7136274 el avi n se ha desintegrado pero hemos evitado que algunos ardieran entre los restos
7136275 tiene la cara con golpes y varias costillas rotas pero ha entrado consciente
7136276 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7136277 hes the kind of person youd want in the room to give advice and counsel
7136278 i am waiting for a decision i fulfil all the criteria
7136279 i believe the government should compensate me for taking away my liberty for six years which also meant i lost the childhood of my daughters
7136280 its totally irresponsible and id like to see the environment department take action to stop the company
7136281 this is a provocative and cynical marketing exercise im sure the majority of young people will see the branding ploy for what it is but making light of an illegal drug that can cause significant harm is not helpful
7136282 the court has now given permission for a full hearing so i can see no reason why she is still in detention
7136283 this paper argues that recent and future changes in the employment of crown servant engineers will soon leave the mod unable to fulfil its intelligent customer remit and hence jeopardize airworthiness
7136284 engineering teams are punch drunk with additional requirements and there is evidence that they do not have the capacity to comply with existing regulations
7136285 he is not being treated any differently to any other person in these circumstances
7136286 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
7136287 glitters case raises the issue of whether we as citizens have a legal entitlement to a passport that taking it away is really under the royal prerogative
7136288 i heard he was out but i havent heard from him and i dont expect to when he lived with me he was a lovely man but i have moved on
7136289 here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity you cant really give him one i would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal
7136290 are crime scene photos where children are being subjected to sexual abuse
7136291 if i were to take a woman to a hotel room commit rape and take a picture no one would call that pornography
7136292 but over the past nine years the whole attitude to the problem has become very antagonistic theres little interest politically and publicly in providing proper treatment facilities it has done such disservice to children
7136293 it was 8am on a monday over a year ago when suddenly there were all these voices in my house i thought they were jehovahs witnesses at first then they said they were the police they didnt tell me why they were there for ages but they knew things about my children their names and what they were doing i got more and more scared i dont think ive ever shaken so badly then they showed me the search warrant i couldnt believe my eyes the words indecent images of children i was in shock and had no inkling of what my partner was doing yet at the same time i had a sort of sudden understanding of why he hadnt been easy to live with for so long i had to send the police off to the business we run to arrest him i thought thats the end of my world the first thing he said when he was arrested was im going to have to commit suicide thats the first thing i thought hed do when i read the search warrant ive known him for 20 years i knew what hed think meanwhile they searched the house took away any computer materials the senior policewoman came with me to wake my teenage daughter i told her what had happened she didnt take it in then we went to the school my other daughters were taken into a room one by one with me and their older sister and the police and told what had happened they were devastated then without me they were questioned about their relationship with their father it was devastating that their dad had this interest and also that someone might think he was doing that to them which was not the case they chewed us up and spat out how do you deal with it we did lots of talking we were all sitting on a bed that night and someone thought of dad all on his own and we sent him a text saying we loved and supported him and were there for him he didnt come home he could have but didnt it was better that we had some space we spoke on the phone the next night it was dreadful hes such a kind hearted person and he felt strongly that he wanted his children to have a childhood yet it didnt occur to him that he was taking away someone elses ive always thought the people doing these things were monsters but i cant think that any more because this does not define him he has a heartfelt desire to deal with the problem and it is something he has to atone for he got a non custodial sentence but this has tainted him forever i feel tainted forever i didnt tell anyone for an awfully long time my mother and siblings dont know i did tell a few friends but aside from one couple who stood by both of us they support me but not him i dont blame them but it upsets me it doesnt work unless they support all of us im an open person but i cant communicate with people in the way i used to there is always this black cloud that i cant tell anyone about i feel sad about it but i made the choice for my family to have as normal a future as possible and for my future and his to be as normal as possible wed been together for years but actually got married after this happened just our daughters were present we realised our family was the most important thing in our life and as a couple we have a lot of work to do but that has to come after he has done the work on himself first if i didnt have absolute confidence that in his heart he wants to overcome this i couldnt do it none of us view his arrest as anything but positive because it is really the only route out he needed help to stop i know that he tried to stop himself at least once because actions he took which didnt make sense at the time now fall into place but how could anybody with three daughters addicted to illegal activities of this nature and on whom the entire family was financially dependent ever admit what he was doing
7136294 when my husband and i were first arrested we were about to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary so i thought i knew him
7136295 the police came to our door on a winters morning just after 6am arrested my husband and took away the hard drive of our computer
7136296 i never looked at child pornography it said on the website that these were artistic images
7136297 i am totally focused on only one thing and that is taking this country through these difficult economic circumstances

7136303 happiness is something which for me needs no expression in music the emotion stands by itself it is self fulfilling where as depression sadness and loneliness are emotions which require catharsis expression and search for a form aside from myself a kind of exorcism

7136371 you cant even really say that theres a first do no harm principle involved since there are plenty of examples of problematic vice presidential choices running from johnson alienated kennedys core to bush i alienated reagans core to quayle lightweight boy blunder
7136372 its clear that the obama campaign felt they needed a forceful voice in foreign policy with georgia rekindling thoughts of a new cold war and a bulldog on working class issues expect a lot of foreign policy pronouncement with altoona pa on the dateline
7136373 this is a guy who is on the balls of his heels heres a guy who is lower off in the polls than any president in modern history
7136374 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7136375 its a good pick for obama for he clearly realizes that more and more voters dont see him with the experience and skills to handle the most important part of the presidency foreign policy
7136376 his problem is folks vote for a president not the vp
7136377 the grey hair maturity and foreign policy credentials help of course balancing obamas benjamin button like campaign where he has grown more innocent and inexperienced before our eyes it is a good safe establishment choice much like dean smith at chapel hill running the 4 corners offense its a great way to protect a 20 point lead the problem is obama doesnt have a 20 point lead
7136378 the associated presss ron fournier the candidate of change went with the status quo he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington abcs jake tapper obama is running on the slogan change we can believe in but the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution senator joe biden of delaware
7136379 des moines register david yepsen its a choice that should help obama in iowa a battleground state
7136380 the best possible pick not only does he of course bring the right resume to the team with respect to foreign and military affairs and crime biden also served as chair of the judiciary committee but hes got the perfect demeanor and skill set hes aggressive and despite his affability hes got a commendable mean streak which is a nice and necessary change after the weak sisters lieberman and edwards picked the past two cycles not just likely gop vp picks romney or pawlenty but mccain too will just get their lunches handed to them
7136381 helps put away pennsylvania he might help because as a longtime backer of israel he has strong jewish support in florida he also attacks well without being mean spirited the downside is that hes not change he helps with foreign policy but obama still has to measure up
7136382 the fighting in georgia underscored the need to bring some foreign policy experience to the ticket its critical that the veep be willing and able to take an axe or at least an ice pick to the presidential candidate of the other party senator obama also needs to improve his performance with lunch bucket and working class democrats biden has spent his career appealing to those voters the obama campaign clearly made the decision that they did not need their veep pick to reinforce their change message and that was a smart move obama brings plenty of change and excitement on his own
7136383 her robe was hanging wide open and she was flashing us her tits
7136384 yeah i did notice it was opening in the front but i couldnt really see much other than her cleavage
7136385 god from where i was i could see it all
7136386 wow youre really living up to your reputation megan told amanda you could stay hard and outfuck her lucky for me
7136387 there will be times when ive got changed three of more times before i leave the house
7136388 could be hormones bad hair day feel fat or spotty
7136389 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7136390 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7136391 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7136392 let joe know that youre glad hes part of our team
7136393 in an odd and ironic way progressives who are unequivocal obama boosters and unequivocal obama bashers embrace similar concepts of limited alternatives in electoral work they seem to rule out candidly critical support of a candidate viewing such an option as either a betrayal of the candidate or a betrayal of principles but supporting one candidate clearly preferable to the republican should not require a lack of candor about the preferred candidates defects and progressive interests are not advanced by claiming against the evidence that it doesnt really matter which candidate wins

7136398 no matter its size or thickness no piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times
7136399 and as you stare sadly at your block of folded paper you tend to agree
7136400 the world was a great place when i made the twelfth fold
7136401 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7136402 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
7136403 its definitely something that has to be addressed because of what i do for this team and what ive done since ive been here bringing this team from one of the bottom teams in the league to a playoff team to a team that won 49 games its not what i want its what i deserve
7136404 i wont be comfortable going into this season knowing i have to play this whole season being the fifth highest paid and not get an extension i would not be happy
7136405 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7136406 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7136407 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7136408 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7136409 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7136410 learned to fly at pensacola though his performance was below par at best good enough to get by he liked flying but didnt love it
7136411 he took out some power lines reminiscent of the 1998 incident in which a marine corps jet sliced through the cables of a gondola at an italian ski resort killing 20 which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral
7136412 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
7136413 demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i mccain did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant
7136414 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down
7136415 there were only a few bits of the fight when i boxed like i wanted to
7136416 but ive got the gold medal and thats what matters i cant believe ive got it round my neck
7136417 it was disrespectful of the crowd i dont know what they were doing there was lots of holding and it was very scrappy but most of it came from him i was trying to wriggle free because i do my best boxing on the outside
7136418 thats not a bite mark its the same as the marks he already has on his chest
7136419 i want to win a gold medal in my home town of london
7136420 obviously the money will have to be nice and it will be hard to say no if they offer me 1m to turn pro but i want to sign a contract to stay as an amateur until 2012 if terry stays i stay
7136421 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7136422 during the boom nine out of 10 houses for sale in many markets were in prime condition now for every 10 houses at least three are dogs
7136423 ive never seen so many houses in this condition before
7136424 and ive been in the business 20 years ive seen bank owned properties in the past they were never like this
7136425 the first one i saw was the worst home i had ever seen in my life
7136426 there were magic marker messages on the front door saying stay out they had poured paint and other stuff on the carpets there was a lot of trash i felt like i was at the scene of a crime i wouldnt let my daughters touch anything
7136427 you find maggots the swimming pools are green the lawns dry up theyre eyesores neighbors yell at us to water the lawn
7136428 all the kitchen appliances cabinets and countertops bathroom fixtures lights are stolen
7136429 they punch holes in the walls dump oil on the carpets the banks are so overwhelmed they havent gotten to the point when they send in crews to fix them up
7136430 a three year old home that recently sold for 660 000 is listed for 350 000 theres no kitchen no master bath the toilet was taken the tub cabinets gone
7136431 once buyers start to feel confident that prices in a given community have stabilized theyll start buying again
7136432 once that inventory is gone well be at the market bottom and the price trajectory will flatten out
7136433 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7136434 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7136435 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7136436 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7136437 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7136438 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7136439 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7136440 you ought to try a little of this instead of drinking

7136486 and i said if you want to come down and see me thats fine and then i asked for badge number and she wouldnt give it to me
7136487 you have reached the general investigations unit please listen carefully if you know extension of investigator trying to reach enter it now for agency directory press 1
7136488 under no circumstance should you give out personal information social security numbers account information without verifying the person youre speaking to is legitimate
7136489 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7136490 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7136491 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7136492 i love it look at how nice and sweet everyone is to me
7136493 to look in the peoples eyes and see the affection and the happiness i like that a lot to see that and provoke that in people
7136494 it was hard for me when my profession decided they didnt want me as much
7136495 sitting at home and waiting for the phone to ring is not a profession
7136496 seine mitknechte zu schlagen und isst und trinkt mit den betrunkenen
7136497 auch an meinem letzten tag gilt ora et labora ein wechsel zwischen arbeit und gebet anspannung und entspannung einatmen und ausatmen
7136498 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
7136499 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals
7136500 ive been working here for 23 years and ive been playing golf six or seven years
7136501 no one in my village plays golf they do not know what golf is about
7136502 i used to win tournaments but i dont play as well now
7136503 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7136504 aimed at one common effect i e to develop mastery over modifications of the mind through slowing down the rate of flow of thoughts in the mind
7136505 the present study shows the superiority of yoga over physical activity in improving the cognitive functions that could be attributed to emphasis on correctness in breathing synchronizing breathing with body movements relaxation and mindful rest
7136506 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
7136507 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environment friendly pest control strategies
7136508 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavour of the resulting oils
7136509 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
7136510 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
7136511 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
7136512 unfortunately at the moment there is no treatment that could be offered that would change the situation what it may prove to be is a very sensitive test of drug treatment response as new agents are developed
7136513 on an average all these apartments are roughly priced between rs10 million to rs25 million depending on the developer the locality the tower etc this is without adding the taxes and other additional charges
7136514 clients who had booked apartments that were sold earlier during our first launch will remain on the earlier contract and pay their remaining instalments as was agreed in the initial project
7136515 if 60 per cent of all these projects have been sold collectively then about 40 per cent are owned by those pakistanis who have dual nationalities or have well established businesses abroad and consider these complexes to be a part of their future investments
7136516 obviously we do have buyers thats why we can see these projects coming up no business likes to play blindly and get established first and then wait for customers
7136517 you cant go to the grocery store for 30 and get the meat the eggs and everything you get here its just awesome
7136518 people need it right now with rising gas prices rising food costs because of rising gas costs luckily this is a stable 30 you get 80 worth of food you cant beat that
7136519 i get unemployment and thats not much so this really helps our family or we wouldnt be eating right now
7136520 id rather be inside rather than outside in a big field
7136521 i think the travers with the exception of the kentucky derby is the three year old race to win its a race steeped in tradition its very important to a stallions career i just think its one of those really great races that kind of define a horse and a trainers career
7136522 we were looking for a grass race for him and the monmouth grass surface should be perfect for big brown
7136523 monmouth was cordial enough to put up a nice purse for him and the fans really took to big brown last time he was there
7136524 well use this race to go to the synthetic surface at santa anita and the breeders cup classic
7136525 were overjoyed that big brown will be returning to new jersey
7136526 big brown coming back to the jersey shore will provide added excitement to september racing at monmouth and should be an across the board winner for his connections the fans and the racing industry in new jersey
7136527 community sport is now the weak link in the chain
7136528 unless you develop volunteers and invest in clubs you cant hope to grow capacity and capacity is what we will need if we want to deliver an olympic legacy of increased participation
7136529 i would love to show someone from the government what it is really like for clubs
7136530 we are really really struggling our phones are red hot because of the olympics but we have to tell parents sorry your child cant come i have had 13 year olds on the waiting lists and not been able to get them into the club until they were 18 i am mrs desperate
7136531 we have put the great back into great britain the tories left the most demoralised sporting family you could imagine labour turned this around with investment into schools governing bodies coaching
7136532 a contribution as with the commonwealth games at manchester is acceptable but half a billion is far too high a loss for grassroots sports
7136533 if we are really trying to build a sporting nation and a legacy before and after the 2012 olympics then we are going about it in totally the wrong way
7136534 anyone who says that more money is going into grassroots sport is plain wrong it is all very well to invest in uk sport which funds elite athletes to win medals but we should be aiming for the grassroots the 10 year olds at home watching the olympics now
7136535 we will bring the governments policy of forcing schools to sell playing fields to an end
7136536 there should be a serious assessment of sports development programs pinpoint areas to establish priorities and involve all sectors of society to support these programs
7136537 im sorry if its not what you expected by coming here
7136538 we sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off cnidus and as the wind did not allow us to go farther we sailed under the lee of crete off salmone coasting along it with difficulty we came to a place called fair havens near which was the city of lasea
7136539 and putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of cyprus because the winds were against us
7136540 sirs i perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives
7136541 now when the south wind blew gently supposing that they had obtained their purpose they weighed anchor and sailed along crete close to the shore
7136542 but soon a tempestuous wind called the northeaster struck down from the land and when the ship was caught and could not face the wind we gave way to it and were driven along running under the lee of a small island called cauda we managed with difficulty to secure the ships boat after hoisting it up they used supports to undergird the ship then fearing that they would run aground on the syrtis they lowered the gear and thus they were driven along since we were violently storm tossed they began the next day to jettison the cargo and on the third day they threw the ships tackle overboard with their own hands when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small tempest lay on us all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned
7136543 men you should have listened to me and not have set sail from crete and incurred this injury and loss yet now i urge you to take heart for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship for this very night there stood before me an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i worship and he said do not be afraid paul you must stand before caesar and behold god has granted you all those who sail with you so take heart men for i have faith in god that it will be exactly as i have been told but we must run aground on some island
7136544 im christian in my religion if i take somebodys money its haram
7136545 solitude trying to stay in control of things always trying to do right
7136546 thats how theyre able to become what they feel inside
7136547 thats who simba is so i encourage him if thats what he wants to do to act out his lion persona
7136548 but some of the guests do kind of look at them like what in the world
7136549 but with star trek theres one thing to relate it to
7136550 if youre a fur theres no one thing to relate it to people cant make sense of it
7136551 a lot of the misunderstanding comes from career minded adults asking why are people this age doing this
7136552 these are the only friends we had when we were growing up
7136553 some people crack open a beer some people sit in front of the tv
7136554 my other half happens to be a furry and our outlook on it is pretty much the same
7136555 you can call it a lifestyle its part of who we are it gives us an escape from the daily bs and rigmarole
7136556 coming up i had a hard life lions were always strong and dominant they helped me get through a lot of troubles just kept me strong
7136557 its basically how much flak are you willing to take
7136558 they think theres a very large sex thing going on and theres not
7136559 it would be a lie to say theres not an adult aspect to it
7136560 but its not a religion or an occult group theres no idols to worship we leave religion out of it completely
7136561 how do i reconcile being a furry and a christian its pretty difficult
7136562 i dont hide it that im a furry within my church and im more involved with my ministry than i am as a furry
7136563 its one of the few times you can say you have a family thats 100 percent accepting of who you are
7136564 you can feel free to be yourself without fear of being persecuted by other people
7136565 were not obsessed to the point where we dont function outside of it
7136566 it just makes you feel like the animal for a short time
7136567 we know that people are going to be busy and there are a million things going on this is like a little gift to the community

7136603 a regroupment based on our common traditions as active revolutionary socialists
7136604 which will locate itself in working class struggle in the workplace in the community amongst the oppressed and in the broad party
7136605 the genuine and serious risks of severe ecological degradation and climate change caused by the capitalist economic model as factors will shape socialist politics in the coming decades
7136606 as socialists we must explain that only by collective action will we be able to develop solutions to climate change the key terrain for this debate in britain is in the trade unions
7136607 our activity in the coming years must as a central priority aim to make the unions an enthusiastic participant in a mass movement against climate change
7136608 the internationalist and explicitly revolutionary implications of ecosocialist politics will be attractive to the radicalizing new generations of activists who have shown themselves capable of impressive feats of organization they have no memory of the defeats suffered by the working class movement in the last three decades but equally they have not seen evidence that convinces them that the real power to change the world lies in the working class it is part of our responsibility to demonstrate that this is so

7136631 the extremists in the middle east are trying to seize power by force keep power by intimidation and build an empire of fear
7136632 although we have discovered only a handful of individuals in the us with ties to al qaida senior leadership the group likely will intensify its efforts to place operatives here in the homeland
7136633 weve got to do a better job of clarifying what are the motivations of terrorists
7136634 i think one of our mistakes has been painting with such a broad brush which has not been particularly helpful in understanding what it is we were up against
7136635 the resentment provoked by these measures is the greatest threat to our national security and the most likely source of the next attack
7136636 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm

7136639 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
7136640 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
7136641 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
7136642 so many results depend on the process a person uses

7136710 he tells his family he is playing tennis but after tennis where does he go to
7136711 when sodomy ii happened everyone was shocked the whole nation was shocked but i was not shocked
7136712 i thought to myself after the six years in jail he is still bad jahat
7136713 why not give him a perdana car and let him go around malaysia
7136714 he anwar talked about corruption that magnum money is haram only he can take haram money rm60 million of magnum money is in his hands what happened to the money
7136715 he is not a gentleman he has no principles he never keeps his words what are principles maybe he does not know the meaning
7136716 nalla stood by anwar and had even gone to jail for him
7136717 anwar has taken rm60 million of magnums money from him
7136718 there were 5 no 10 oh no 15 maybe 10 15 sms es threats by pkr supporters
7136719 i took the phone and heard anwars threats to me asking me not to come over to permatang pauh
7136720 i took the phone and heard anwars threats to me asking me not to come over to permatang pauh
7136721 by the way did he paid tax for the 60 millions he gave away
7136722 his hexs spells are boomeranging and will hit his arse
7136723 why did nalla if he was such an evil man
7136724 i remember what nallakaruppan told me in munich that he believed anwar would be the saviour of the indian community in malaysia
7136725 that is the same thing nallakaruppan reiterated at the function pkr held at the hotel istana in kuala lumpur to welcome him into the party when he joined us in the later part of 2006 he told the gathering that he would get one hundred thousand indians to join pkr in the event he barely garnered two thousand
7136726 some of them played an important role in influencing me to part ways with anwar and the party
7136727 now they have gone back to the party stating that they only believed in pkrs ideology
7136728 these are people aiming for financial rewards not those who have any form of political belief
7136729 do not speak about freedom of speech if you are not prepared for the consequences
7136730 sms threats secret video tapes and rm60million in anwars hand

7136810 nearly all north american records are of the paler mantled britain iceland population instability mounts in pakistan amid decision to impeach musharraf
7136811 this is the biggest record in music right now go hard is what we doing to survive in this world this anthem is timeless there are so many hip hop quotables on this record
7136812 it is cautious to assume a significant proportion will fail
7136813 such a warning from the environment agency must be taken extremely seriously the failure of just one container could prove catastrophic
7136814 absence of robust arguments which demonstrate that this target is achievable in practice
7136815 that are not expected to be durable over periods of hundreds of years
7136816 it is not clear how package integrity during storage can be assured over the extended timescales now being suggested
7136817 if we are going to dispose of the waste this should be done as quickly as reasonably possible
7136818 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7136819 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7136820 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7136821 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7136822 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7136823 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7136824 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7136825 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7136826 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7136827 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7136828 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7136829 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7136830 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7136831 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7136832 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7136833 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7136834 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7136835 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7136836 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7136837 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7136838 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7136839 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7136840 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7136841 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7136842 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7136843 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7136844 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7136845 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7136846 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7136847 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7136848 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7136849 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7136850 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7136851 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7136852 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7136853 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7136854 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7136855 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7136856 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7136857 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7136858 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7136859 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7136860 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7136861 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7136862 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7136863 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7136864 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7136865 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7136866 in military terms i think we the french are pretty tough
7136867 our normal reaction to losing people is not to sit down and cry and then rush to the exits that is not the french way
7136868 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7136869 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquires but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7136870 once we get information where they are we will take measures be it force or negotiations we will try to ensure the safety and release of the journalists
7136871 consular officials are in contact with local authorities in an attempt to confirm these reports
7136872 our coaching staff is very pleased to be reunited with michael
7136873 as you know kenny miller paul lapolice and gary etcheverry all worked with michael in toronto and they believe he brings many assets to our organization
7136874 in fact michaels playing rights were acquired from calgary while gary was the head coach of the argos
7136875 the toronto argonauts would like to thank michael bishop for his years of service and contributions to our team
7136876 we wish him well with this new opportunity in saskatchewan
7136877 in making this trade we certainly respect the toronto leadership for acknowledging michael had been placed in a very difficult situation via the kerry joseph deal
7136878 athletically they hated to see him go but both adam rita and rich argos head coach rich stubler expressed a desire to be fair to michael given the many contributions he made to their club
7136879 in that regard its important to remember toronto went 11 1 with michael as their starting quarterback in 2007
7136880 as to what impact this trade will have on our current quarterbacking situation that is as it should be a coaching decision
7136881 kenny wanted michael in green and white weve accomplished that and kenny will assess the overall situation as we go forward
7136882 when they first approached me to do this run my first reaction was youve got to be joking
7136883 but then after speaking to family and friends who had children of their own i started to think it might be something i could do
7136884 the only way to capture the insanity of that era
7136885 when i first became involved with music there was an electric vibrant energy that fueled my passion for working in the industry
7136886 but then i went to a major label as it was absorbed by a large faceless corporation and watched the life get sucked out of the company the music and its employees its no mystery why most corporate music has no soul
7136887 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name
7136888 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations
7136889 she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
7136890 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
7136891 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna
7136892 but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
7136893 to send love and acknowledgment to women who brighten your day teach you new things and live their lives fully with generosity and joy
7136894 people ask me what i do in winter when theres no baseball ill tell you what i do i stare out the window and wait for spring
7136895 learned to fly at pensacola though his performance was below par at best good enough to get by he liked flying but didnt love it
7136896 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind it should disqualify him
7136897 my temper has often been both a matter of public speculation and personal concern
7136898 i have a temper to state the obvious which i have tried to control with varying degrees of success because it does not always serve my interest or the publics
7136899 according to them he really unleashed on some of them and they couldnt figure out why it happened enough that it was affecting his credibility with some people if you wanted a programmed subdued always on message politician he wasnt and will never be your guy
7136900 i dont think that he forgets anyone who ever opposed him that he can ever really respect or trust them again
7136901 barack had a way both intellectually and in demeanor that defused skeptics
7136902 one of the best in the nation on campaign finance disclosure
7136903 to deal with extremely complex issues to reach across the aisle and to deal with diverse people
7136904 bad you can use our killdisk bootable floppy creator to command or file name
7136905 this is it i just hope i have the right words
7136906 in life everyone will cross a bridge that bridge may be big or it may be small but no matter the size of that bridge the most important thing to know is that when it is time to cross it things will be different never look back always look forward believe in yourself and stand for what you believe in basketball to me is like life some days you will have good days and other days may not be so grand everything takes practice and a lot of perseverance i will never forget the journey and what i have learned i will take it with me and apply it to my life
7136907 if i dont face my demons now they could forever control me
7136908 this better not be my mom calling me at 2 in the morning
7136909 go figure dont have to pay for the baby to be born but somehow i found a way to give my money away
7136910 does not govern life and death if it did no good person would ever die young
7136911 are just family you have yet to come to know
7136912 lost love is still love eddie it takes a different form thats all you cant see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor but when those senses weaken another heightens memory memory becomes your partner you nurture it you hold it you dance with it life has to end
7136913 after all that weve been through it all comes back down to me and you after all
7136914 her whole life will be training she will be in training mode for the rest of her life

7136934 every follower of bahaullah conscious of the forces of integration and disintegration operating in society today sees the relationship between the rise in receptivity to the faith in all parts of the globe and the failings of the worlds systems that such receptivity will increase as the agonies of humanity deepen is certain

7136938 as we survey what has been accomplished around the world our hearts are filled with particular admiration for the believers in iran who under the most arduous conditions have arisen boldly to serve their country and are bending their energies toward its revitalization though the avenues open to them are limited
7136939 institutions from the national to the local level see with ever greater clarity how to create conditions conducive to the expression of the spiritual energies of a growing number of believers in pursuit of a common goal

7136948 weve historically started through the normal turn 11 but with the number of cars we are running here this year 27 we would be stacked up so far back through turn 10 even coming out of turn 9a it would create an unsafe situation once you go green in restarts you resume racing and i think we might end up in a position where cautions breed cautions situations could re develop in turn 11 immediately so we will try and string them out a bit by using the long course
7136949 its an amazing weekend it was a new track again and we were really good we tried to catch raphael matos in the qualifying he tested here last weekend so he had a better chance of being good than us so its good that we got the pole we had a good race the car was consistent we didnt have to push it 100 percent it was good to have a race like that
7136950 it was a good race were trying to maximize the points as much as we can this weekend its important that we come out of this weekend with a real chance at the championship were leading the championship by one point so its a good thing richard antinucci finished behind me unfortunately we didnt have enough for franck perera but it was a good race and well make improvements for tomorrow
7136951 we had that great start but unfortunately i had to give way rules are rules i was just following my line and my row on the start we had a better start than the other line with raphael matos on the front row i had to let him by so i let him by i dropped one spot at the end of lap 1 in a weird way and let him by we had good speed at the end i think were there and well make improvements for sunday
7136952 it went well we definitely made some gains in the car particularly at the beginning of the race we definitely had the speed of the guys up front and then as we started getting into the race the front tires just started going off so that was affecting me on the brakes particularly in some of the slower corners i was having a tough time keeping up i fell into the trap of either youre overdriving it a little bit or youre just a little bit slow that was a fine line that i crossed over a little bit too far a couple of times that allowed logan gomez to catch back up a little bit but well make a couple of changes here and i think well have a really good run tomorrow
7136953 we qualified fourth which is a season best for guthrie racing weve got izod on the car for this race so i think its some good luck it was good to qualify fourth weve just got to stay up there i ran into some trouble with another competitor who passed before the green flag you cant do much once theyre by you and then youve got to pass them i ended up making a pass on track for fifth again it was just a tough race well see where the inversion goes and see where well be starting tomorrow there wasnt much passing in the race so maybe we can start up front
7136954 the guys did an incredible job moving past the fire turning the page and moving forward if there is a team that can rebound its team penske they proved it today were happy with every accomplishment that weve made this weekend starting on the front row is big for us were going to continue working hard tomorrow and hopefully have a good finish
7136955 its been pretty clear we have really fast cars on the road courses i think apart from st petersburg weve had the front row every time its been really good also between helio castroneves and myself we really push each other a lot too and thats a big bonus having two really fast cars on these tracks we compare the data after every session and ill pick up a bit where hes strong and hell pick up a bit where im strong and we just try to put it all together so i think that really helps too its great to have team penske sweep the front row again
7136956 its good we carried it through weve sort of been there all weekend in the top three were happy about that i think i could have done a better job in that last run but it does feel good theyre very long races we know its a lot about strategy a lot of yellows fall in this race were just happy weve got two cars up there were doing well
7136957 we were one change behind in the firestone fast six we tried everything and as a team weve come a long way weve been struggling on the road courses so im glad to see were in the top four at infineon you dont want to start worse than the second row
7136958 i think were probably disappointed with our qualifying the car was fairly decent and then on that last qualifying run we tried to lower the car a lot to see if we were just missing and every time i tried to touch the brakes i was locking them up and we couldnt even get within eight tenths of a second of our last run it was worth a try i think we would have only been one spot better maybe in fourth we just didnt have enough for what those two penske cars had we always seem to race a little bit better and were definitely happy with where were at we just have to make sure we can follow up with some points tomorrow
7136959 we had a great first two sessions and i was really happy with the car but at the end we made a mistake with the pressures and the car was sliding all over plus the track got hotter and i just couldnt stay close i think we had a chance to put in a good lap at the end at least to beat scott dixon but i waited a little too long to get a gap and i didnt get to make a run just a terrible session but im happy that the car was good in the first two sessions and were in good position for the race
7136960 im disappointed that we didnt make the firestone fast six for the first time this season i thought we had the potential the mcdonalds car was quick but just a little difficult to drive it was right on the edge all the way around so we couldnt quite put a lap together i think we have the performance to gain some spots but i dont think this track lends itself to overtaking well just have to have a smart race stay out of trouble and keep picking them off one at a time maybe we can overtake but its only if somebody makes a mistake weve seen a lot of people go off around here its a tough track the better your car is the more fuel you can save and the more chance you have of passing people in the pits we just need to make sure the car is good tomorrow morning in the warm up
7136961 were not where we want to be because i think anything other than being in the firestone fast six is a disappointment but the guys did a great job on the car and i think we can race from here tomorrow the engineering staff turned a 14th place car into an eighth place one overnight and we had something for the rest of the field until we got to the slow speed sections of the track we were as fast as anyone in the first half of the lap and i think we could have caused some trouble but we just didnt have the whole package today well work on it some more and get it tomorrow
7136962 it was great that the motorola car was able to make it into the fast 12 i cant believe how close the times were of course i wish that we would have been able to make it into the firestone fast six but we are headed in the right direction hopefully we can keep the car up front and out of trouble throughout the race
7136963 i had my hands full in qualifying today the car was on the edge of grip at both ends we made one little change and we completely tipped the car over from understeer to oversteer it wasnt our best effort today and we would be happier if we were starting a bit higher on the grid the blockbuster star wars the clone years race car is very good though so were confident heading into tomorrow
7136964 its a great track i thought we would have enough to get through to the next round of qualifying but we didnt obviously its a little frustrating because we wanted to have a good showing these last couple of road course races we thought that our luck would be a little bit better than the other road courses other than st pete once again lady luck isnt on our shoulder it didnt come our way well just have to try to work our way to the front in the race
7136965 i just dont think we got everything we could have out of the car today obviously missing the full practice session yesterday slowed us down but we recovered quite well this morning i thought it just didnt translate into qualifying for whatever reason today
7136966 obviously im disappointed our expectations were much different from where we finished in qualifications today were working on it the delphi national guard car was very fast in practice yesterday and we were just a few ticks away from advancing to the second round today like always a lot can happen in the race tomorrow and were looking forward to it
7136967 i dont have a lot of complaints about the balance it seems like we need more grip overall i think the william rast guys have done a good job to give me a car thats the best ive had this year on a road course but unfortunately as competitive as it is we need another big step in total car grip all in all id like to be much higher of course but in terms of what im feeling in the car it doesnt feel that bad tomorrow well just have to be clever be smart we know were not the fastest car here this weekend but were also not that bad when ive run with some of the faster guys in practice i might not have the outright speed but i dont know that were that far off either over a race distance
7136968 i like coming to sonoma its usually a good track for me for whatever reason we just dont have the car working exactly like wed like it to so were going to start further in the back which is something weve done in the past if we can get it all sorted out by tomorrow morning we should be good come race time weve done it before we can do it again its just taking us a little bit longer to get a handle of the track with the cars so its a little disappointing
7136969 we did alright but things did not go exactly as planned we had some tire vibration that affected us our tire balance changed from this mornings practice and we could not get any grip on the track we are going to look at it this afternoon and get it straightened out before tomorrow
7136970 it was kind of a messed up qualifying with two yellows and it left us just one set of tires and five laps we did a pretty decent lap compared to what we had been doing in practice it was just a tenth of a second off our best lap all weekend maybe if we had had a little more time out there we might have improved our time even more but it was also bad luck for us to fall into the tougher qualifying group too
7136971 im not exactly happy with qualifying i was just a little bit better than this morning but in the overall ranking i actually dropped positions so thats disappointing the track changed a little bit and i felt like that some of the changes we made ended up being opposite of what the track ended up doing well chalk that up as a new experience its still been a good weekend for us as we have gone faster but with the positive way things were going i really thought i would be able to put the menards car and the team in a better qualifying position than i did thats the part that is disappointing

7137052 voglio che qualcuno ti travolga voglio che tu canti e danzi con grande felicit abbi una felicit delirante o almeno non respingerla lo so che ti suona smielato ma lamore passione ossessione qualcuno da amare alla follia e che ti ami alla stessa maniera come trovarlo b dimentica il cervello e ascolta il tuo cuore io non sento il cuore perch la verit tesoro che non ha senso vivere lui che aspetta da sempre lui che le ha dedicato tanti pensieri lui che la sogna lui che ha fatto tante scommesse col tempo lui che non ha mai il coraggio di esporsi lui che non lha detto a nessuno quanto gli piace quanto la vorrebbe lui
7137053 quando aspetti una risposta la sogni e la vuoi quando affidi una fetta di futuro a un pezzo d carta sperando che resista pi dellacciaio quando aspetti unora due un giorno intero e poi un altro e ci credi e ci credi ancora la immagini che ride che mangia una pizza che guarda in su la immagini vestita nel modo pi bello e poi la pensi sola in compagnia della sua pelle morbida e profumata una sera cm tante e magari aspetta te
7137054 a volte quando ami accade che lo dici nel modo peggiore perch se fosse tutto chiaro e limpido non sarebbe amore amore confusione e passione e non mi serve a niente e quelle parole mi scivolano tra le dita cadono e tu ricordami domani di salutare quella vita che riprende dove tu non ci sarai non come io vorrei e non farmi dimenticare mai che davanti a quella scuola io sognavo d noi

7137081 per quanto fatto oggi siamo sulla strada giusta ma dobbiamo continuare a lavorare per migliorare la forma fisica io in primis abbiamo sopperito alla carenza di condizione con la buona volont per credo che possiamo fare ancora meglio in campo il mister ci ha schierato con un metodo di gioco nuovo che secondo me in certe fasi della stagione potr tornarci utile

7137083 has nothing to do with punishing the animal but with the purifying power that the lifeblood is thought to have
7137084 in the interests of making the gospel marketable paul poured the new wine into old conceptual forms spiced with a dose of spiritualizing and enlivened by the real spiritual experience that he and his fellows were having
7137085 the gospel is the person and work of jesus as the salvation event toward which gods mission has been moving and from which that mission now moves into the entire world
7137086 the apostolic ministry of witness takes place in a plurality of forms none of them is normative for the others but they are essential to each other as mutual affirmation correction and challenge they are all complementary in that they all respond to the same story proclaim the same christ and pursue the implications of the same gospel in their various particular settings no particular cultural rendering of the gospel may claim greater validity than any other and all cultural formulations of the faith are subject to continuing conversion as the gospel challenges them
7137087 evangelisation as the heart of ministry means that the gospel centred community continually encounters and celebrates christ this is the purpose and witness of public worship evangelisation as the heart of ministry happens as christ commissions the community to be his witnesses to do his witness and to say his witness continuing conversion is to christs salvation and thus to his mission

7137092 jesus was ready to die and he was willing to die it was not a death however that was required as compensatory retribution for the sins of his enemies and his friends it was a death that resulted from fulfilment of his mission of his mission about the reign of god
7137093 jesus of nazareth announced the sovereign grace of god whereby the poor in spirit could receive gods love jesus himself in his life and death made the response of humility obedience and trust which god had long sought in vain in raising him to live and reign god confirmed and completed the witness which jesus bore to god on earth reasserted claim over the whole of creation pardoned sinners and made in jesus a representative beginning of a new order of righteousness and love to god in christ all people are called to respond in faith to this end god has sent forth the spirit that people may trust god as their father and acknowledge jesus as lord the whole work of salvation is effected by the sovereign grace of god alone
7137094 the church as the fellowship of the holy spirit confesses jesus as lord over its own life it also confesses that jesus is head over all things the beginning of a new creation of a new humanity god in christ has given to all people in the church the holy spirit as a pledge and foretaste of that coming reconciliation and renewal which is the end in view for the whole creation the churchs call is to serve that end to be a fellowship of reconciliation a body within which the diverse gifts of its members are used for the building up of the whole an instrument through which christ may work and bear witness to himself
7137095 the uniting church affirms that every member of the church is engaged to confess the faith of christ crucified and to be his faithful servant it acknowledges with thanksgiving that the one spirit has endowed the members of christs church with a diversity of gifts and that there is no gift without its corresponding service all ministries have a part in the ministry of christ

7137113 biden ha denunciado el escaso juicio pol tico de obama en pol tica exterior y ha criticado personalmente lo que los estadounidenses est n empezando a constatar que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7137114 my driver has kind of left me the last few days
7137115 and im going to do a little chipping and putting and then ill be ready to go
7137116 play at that same temp and at that same level with those older guys
7137117 i got to know the flow of the game and how everything works and how quick it is
7137118 i feel a lot more prepared and ready to go
7137119 i just have to take everything in as it comes
7137120 im looking forward to each day and working as hard as i can to try and make this club
7137121 i went to some powerskating camps and tried to improve on everything i could to try and make this team
7137122 last year i felt a little uncomfortable at camp not knowing any of the players or the coaching staff
7137123 playing with the team this year i really felt i got to know everybody and that made me feel a little more comfortable out there i felt like i was able to play my game a bit better
7137124 my speed allows me to see the ice a bit more and create plays
7137125 i think im a playmaker and my speed obviously helps that
7137126 i think both those kids did what was needed to prepare for camp
7137127 they got a taste of it last year and then played a few games on our us swing last year they were well prepared for what our expectations were they just have to continue to compete and be consistent both of them were leaders among the young guys and you can really tell that theyve elevated their game
7137128 our coaching staff is very pleased to be reunited with michael
7137129 as you know kenny miller paul lapolice and gary etcheverry all worked with michael in toronto and they believe he brings many assets to our organization
7137130 in fact michaels playing rights were acquired from calgary while gary was the head coach of the argos
7137131 in making this trade we certainly respect the toronto leadership for acknowledging michael had been placed in a very difficult situation via the kerry joseph deal
7137132 athletically they hated to see him go but both adam rita and rich stubler expressed a desire to be fair to michael given the many contributions he made to their club
7137133 in that regard its important to remember toronto went 11 1 with michael as their starting quarterback in 2007
7137134 as to what impact this trade will have on our current quarterbacking situation that is as it should be a coaching decision
7137135 kenny wanted michael in green and white weve accomplished that and kenny will assess the overall situation as we go forward
7137136 we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
7137137 av vendors want to keep operating under dos style threat mitigation heuristics and methodologies which for so long have proven functional
7137138 dont attribute to malice what is adequately explained by stupidity
7137139 normally in the linux world the way we respond to knowledge of a specific vulnerability is to patch the problem rather than scan for exploits
7137140 scanning for exploits is always going to be a lost cause viz windows security and the ineffectiveness of the whole anti malware industry
7137141 i want to take this opportunity to apologise for any upset caused we were really shocked to hear what happened and are so sorry to everyone on the street affected by this
7137142 had traveled to moab early that day to provide cancer screening cancer treatment and other medical services to citizens in moab

7137145 ive met senator biden hes a great man lots of experience very good on foreign policy team player i just think its a good choice
7137146 i think that would have been a great ticket but i never saw it really as something that was a probability i think obama needs her in the senate getting the health care legislation through thats where she can be valuable
7137147 was the best choice by far from the standpoint of looking ahead to november it didnt seem that the chemistry between the two was ever going to work so joe biden was a good second choice as far as im concerned but an excellent choice as far as the democratic ticket is concerned

7137162 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
7137163 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
7137164 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
7137165 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7137166 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7137167 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7137168 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7137169 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7137170 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7137171 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7137172 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7137173 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7137174 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7137175 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7137176 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7137177 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7137178 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7137179 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7137180 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7137181 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7137182 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7137183 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7137184 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7137185 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7137186 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7137187 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7137188 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7137189 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7137190 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7137191 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7137192 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7137193 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7137194 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7137195 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7137196 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7137197 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7137198 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7137199 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7137200 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7137201 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7137202 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7137203 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7137204 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7137205 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7137206 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7137207 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7137208 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7137209 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7137210 who are open to doing something on the production side
7137211 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7137212 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7137213 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7137214 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7137215 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7137216 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7137217 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7137218 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7137219 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7137220 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7137221 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7137222 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7137223 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7137224 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7137225 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7137226 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7137227 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7137228 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7137229 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7137230 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7137231 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7137232 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7137233 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7137234 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7137235 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7137238 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7137239 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7137240 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7137241 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7137242 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7137243 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7137244 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7137245 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7137246 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7137247 it certainly brings to mind what kind of monster is this

7137252 people here are just ecstatic to see that someone cares
7137253 proves that your goal is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
7137254 we knew they were looking for a media provocation on the high seas
7137255 so we decided not to let them have the confrontation they wanted

7137260 we dont expect problems with the major components on your vehicle while it can and does happen it is much less likely than before
7137261 we have also added more computer technology each year and it has greatly improved the quality of our vehicles performance the computers warn us of problems much earlier than before and some adjustments the computer even makes on its own unfortunately computers fail and when they do we cant fix them we simply replace them if your engine control module fails on your new impala it will cost 1055 to replace
7137262 that s why even a minor repair can be a major expense
7137263 things arent enthusiastic between them its hornlike because hes photography in new mexico and shes in los angeles the relation is unnatural and their start wont hap anytime soon
7137264 if we category of consequence up and say lets go do it thats how we module do it

7137268 theres exclusive digit concern and we got to verify tending of it
7137269 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
7137270 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
7137271 hes not likely to take gifts if you would with strings attached give me the tools dont give me the training
7137272 you hear it all the time i dont know that the pakistanis completely trust us
7137273 weve left the region before are we using them just for the war on terror and once afghanistan becomes a stable environment were going to go away
7137274 as a military guy every bone in your body says lets go find them and kill them you temper that with the fragility of the current government in islamabad by asking do you do more long term harm if you act very very aggressively militarily that debate continues and its very difficult
7137275 i genuinely believe that if we are going to eliminate al qaeda and the senior leadership we have to go where they are and they are in the tribal areas of pakistan
7137276 my opinion is there isnt that clear and present danger
7137277 every bit of intel they ever could gather was snippets
7137278 under every rock theres an al qaeda i dont think so
7137279 the strategy and tactics of cias global pursuit of al qaeda and its affiliates have everything to do with the situation on the ground and nothing zero to do with political schedules in our country sources peddling trash to the contrary are either ill informed ill intentioned or both

7137302 la perspectiva sobre el futuro que arrojan estos cuadros sociales es simplemente aterradora
7137303 este proceso de regresi n cultural no podr a tener lugar sin una condici n preliminar el silencio de los intelectuales bajo cualquiera de sus manifestaciones ya sean art sticas o acad micas period sticas o literarias
7137304 bajo la primac a absoluta de la ficcionalizaci n de lo real y de la reducci n de la cultura a entertainment se han eliminado las voces y las tradiciones intelectuales m s l cidas del siglo xx como si no fueran otra cosa que un deliro superfluo
7137305 la alegre banalizaci n y la subsiguiente abdicaci n de las tradiciones cr ticas en las culturas de cuatro continentes la insolidaridad con las resistencias y protestas sociales en nombre de la superaci n de los sujetos hist ricos y la celebraci n de la cultura como espect culo han enmudecido a esa intelligentsia tachada frente a lo que hoy se exhibe obscenamente como sus ltimas consecuencias la trivialidad de la guerra como videojuego la deconstrucci n estad stica de la democracia como performance y una devastaci n de ecosistemas comunidades humanas y culturas de magnitudes incontrolables bajo el espect culo global de para sos comodificados y una arcaica impasibilidad social
7137306 pero hab a un modo oblicuo por el cual los poetas habr an de entrar al mercado hasta devenir parte indispensable de su funcionamiento sin tener que negarse a s mismos por entero
7137307 el pensamiento postmoderno del fin de la historia no nos augura un futuro muy diferente del presente una imagen a la que ve extra amente como motivo de celebraci n pero hay en realidad un futuro posible entre otros y su nombre es fascismo la gran prueba del postmodernismo o por lo que importa de toda otra doctrina pol tica es c mo zafar de esto pero su relativismo cultural y su convencionalismo moral su escepticismo pragmatismo y localismo su disgusto por las ideas de solidaridad y organizaci n disciplinada su falta de una teor a adecuada de la participaci n pol tica todo eso pesa fuertemente contra l
7137308 bajo esta doble constelaci n el nuevo poder medi tico y militar global ha creado aquella misma condici n objetiva elemental bajo la que walter benjamin o pier paolo pasolini definieron el fascismo moderno el estado general de impotencia de una humanidad disminuida a la funci n de espectador y consumidor de su propia destrucci n
7137309 sin duda las sociedades no se critican a s mismas los cr ticos sociales son individuos pero tambi n son la mayor parte del tiempo miembros que hablan en p blico a otros miembros que se incorporan al habla y cuyo discurso constituye una reflexi n colectiva sobre las condiciones de la vida colectiva
7137310 la deslegitimaci n y el dominio de la performatividad son el toque de agon a de la era del profesor ste no es m s competente que las redes de memoria para transmitir el saber establecido y no es m s competente que los equipos interdisciplinarios para imaginar nuevas jugadas o nuevos juegos

7137314 our earth described a spiral course that is we move in circles but we never come back to the same point the circle is not closed we only reach the same plane where we began it is characteristic of a spiral that it seems to be a circle but is not closed

7137317 i know if i go home and work as hard as i can that it is possible for a british person to win in london 2012
7137318 im glad a non chinese person won it removes a mental barrier to know the chinese are beatable its like the four minute mile once someone did it loads of people did it afterwards its good to know people are catching up with them
7137319 it was probably a bit of a shock initially we walked off the plane and he had photographers chasing him down the walkway like he was madonna but one of our goals was to learn as much as possible i think he could probably write a book i think hes acquitted himself fantastically
7137320 there were a few dives i could have done a lot better but i wouldnt have finished higher than fifth or sixth the other divers were amazing and i couldnt keep up because of my tariff i just need to go back learn some harder dives and perfect them
7137321 basically what were going to have in this race is barack obama and joe biden both of whom grew up with very little and both of whom worked their way up and know what hard working regular families are feeling
7137322 if he cant survive what on earth will happen to us

7137331 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7137332 just about every day he was at my house and wed play nintendo games like joe montana football all the time
7137333 john was pretty good but i played a bit more than he did
7137334 i dont know what he likes to tell about his high school experience but mine was very different from the way life is now
7137335 i was about five feet tall wearing a back brace due to scoliosis
7137336 to be honest i dont think either one of us was doing that great with the ladies in high school john was still kind of fitting into a niche hes more than made up for himself with how hes done since then
7137337 it can sometimes be a little frustrating trying to comprehend the messages you are trying to convey when your sentences make no sense at all i sometimes get the impression that i am conversing with a 6 year old
7137338 disagree with mchale vandermass parkinson or the rest of that goon squad and you end up the target of invective language violently abusive language
7137339 next this person is going to claim the kkk and native protesters cannot be the same because one is white
7137340 he doesnt have the big wow factor but obamas got the wow factor so its not what he needs he needs somebody safe and biden is safe
7137341 has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7137342 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7137343 this is the one time it matters hell go to the convention and theyll take pictures and then theyll put him on a bus and hes going to drive through nebraska kansas and alabama or wherever theyre going to send him unless he says something off the cuff thats embarrassing it wont be a problem
7137344 very much like lincoln reminding people that politics is messy and theres a gamesmanship to it but that at its core it is meant to reflect the ideals of the people that it represents and that it is participatory that people need to be part of it and so in that sense he and lincoln are on the same page
7137345 we need a policy to create jobs here in america
7137346 to invest in people and our infrastructure right here in the u s a
7137347 at a time when iraq has a 79 billion surplus they have parked it in banks in new york city it doesnt make too much sense for us to be still spending u s taxpayer dollars 10 billion monthly rebuilding baghdad
7137348 we should use some of that money to rebuild virginia building roads and laying broadband lines and putting people back to work
7137349 we create jobs now but we also create the competitive platform for the future
7137350 i refuse to sit back like we did in 2000 and 2004 this administration is the worst administration in american foreign policy in modern history maybe ever every single thing theyve touched has been a near disaster

7137371 the next vice president of the united states joe biden
7137372 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk
7137373 i think everybody in america will know who we picked and why we picked him
7137374 to me its just kind of the culmination of lots of things for him
7137375 it didnt really matter i just wanted obama and i knew he would make a good pick
7137376 its going to become more and more apparent to voters that the experience and knowledge needed to be president is not at the top of the democratic ticket
7137377 we know what were going to get from the other side four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home and a disastrous foreign policy abroad
7137378 we cant afford more of the same i am running for president because thats a future that i dont accept for my daughters and i dont accept it for your children its time for the change that the american people need
7137379 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7137380 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7137381 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7137382 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7137383 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7137384 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7137385 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7137386 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7137387 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7137388 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7137389 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7137390 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7137391 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7137392 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7137393 ready to make nice how to get along with your right wing relatives
7137394 so and so is really passive aggressive i dont know what youd call my style though i tend to take it and take it and take it until i finally lose it what do you call that

7137398 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7137399 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7137400 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7137401 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7137402 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7137403 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7137404 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7137405 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7137406 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7137407 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7137408 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7137409 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7137410 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7137411 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7137412 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7137413 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7137414 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7137415 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold i competed against biden in the 88 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy he is always extremely well prepared is very smart a top level debater gutsy strong and has great personal integrity
7137416 we fear his condition can deteriorate after hearing the news so we have kept it from him
7137417 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7137418 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be
7137419 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7137420 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7137421 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7137422 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president
7137423 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states
7137424 when mainstream heroes are playing negative characters wholl want to see standard villains perform such roles
7137425 the best thing about this book for the beginner is that it gives you a lot of wines to choose from that should be easy to find and enjoy in the past i either wasnt able to track a particular wine down or once found hesitated to pay the asking price given the mixed results id had to date
7137426 an indian boxer beating a russian world champion was that possible earlier its never happened and is only possible because the refereeing was fair
7137427 india is going to be the next big boxing country but for that it needs to bring in a big boxing event to increase exposure for the sport
7137428 with the referee in the ring blocking the view it is possible that not all the judges get a clear view
7137429 a new machine will be tested by next february we are more hurt that anybody else by the allegations of favouritism and this is just the beginning of the change it will get better
7137430 they can tell me the megapixel count and amount of zoom in a camera but they arent able to tell how each feature can be particularly useful for me
7137431 most customers feel that they are not given enough time and attention by salesmen in fact the consumer has to rely more on the companys printed literature for details rather than the salesman
7137432 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7137433 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7137434 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7137435 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing
7137436 on this the seventh day of january in the year of our lord 1793 we the sons and heirs to the oldest families of england and scotland do found and charter our own free fellows league
7137437 well jerry we just have a super group of guys on the
7137438 i thought we was gonna run out of gas there at the end but i got a nice push from my teammate jerry jeff jeeter mcpheeter racin in the
7137439 the victim was still alive and gasping for breath when we discovered him
7137440 it is obvious he had been assaulted a few minutes before we reached the area we shifted him to rajawadi hospital for treatment where he succumbed to his injuries
7137441 two hours after ali left we received a call from the police they called us to rajawadi hospital saying ali was injured but when we arrived there we saw he had been murdered and his throat slit
7137442 ali had left home after a phone call but we dont know who called him or why ali was a studious boy studying in jhunjhunwala college he never indulged in fights in the locality although we are not aware of any fights he may have been involved in in college
7137443 i am a painter and begin my day sitting outside borivali station looking for work

7137451 is there any more mgm cartoon logos 6th logo tom amp jerry varents
7137452 with our nation at war our economy in recession we know the american people can not afford four more years of the same old policies and the same old politics we know that a time for change has come
7137453 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7137454 we believe our tomorrows will be better than our yesterdays that literally has been the american way and it will be that way again but theres a missing piece and that piece is leadership
7137455 these times require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change we need
7137456 you cant change america when you support george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7137457 you learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him
7137458 ladies and gentleman no one knows better than i do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre challenged every single day ive watched barack obama face it with steel in his spine
7137459 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7137460 committing record amounts of time money and energy this election to educate voters about john mccains anti worker agenda and elect barack obama and joe biden and a pro worker majority in congress
7137461 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7137462 when its time for straight answers clear conviction and decisive action
7137463 should be a grave concern to reasonable people of good will on both sides of this issue
7137464 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7137465 should the concentrations of fish move to the north it actually could be harmful to keep us from going where the fish are
7137466 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7137467 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7137468 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7137469 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7137470 no hor rio de pico voc encontra muita gente ainda sentada nas mesas
7137471 if i can get this cheaper next year why buy now
7137472 barack is a scary muslim with a crazy christian pastor
7137473 we will put our case to him very firmly and we would expect him to take what we say into account
7137474 the only thing we can do is give the minister the benefit of the doubt at this stage hes obviously going to listen to powerlink as well
7137475 but we believe that the process is tainted and somebody needs to stand up to powerlink
7137476 youve only got to listen to people whove had to deal with them in the past and the experience theyve had with them
7137477 this is not an organisation that consults in an open and transparent manner the minister is responsible for making sure that they do consult in an open and transparent manner
7137478 with carbon emissions trading very much to the fore the economics are starting to stack up much more favourably for renewable energy
7137479 the council as a whole is united in a vision that says we want to be australias most sustainable region
7137480 thats in a range of areas from environmental outcomes through to those new generation area of energy production
7137481 we certainly could set the vision that we want to have a large proportion of our energy needs actually produced here in the region and weve got great opportunities to do that
7137482 ive noticed that things like drinks bread and milk have all gone up
7137483 if i had a different job then im sure it would be a different matter
7137484 to convert the republican party and american conservatism in general against their respective wills into a new kind of conservative politics suitable to governing a modern democracy
7137485 sometimes the right hand doesnt know what the far right hand is doing
7137486 we need you to hold our feet to the fire
7137487 whats the point of having an army if you dont use it
7137488 sardonic but humorless in our hours together he didnt attempt a joke and he misread several of our attempts at playfulness
7137489 do you there are things i believe which should not in my position at least be shared with the public at large for everybodys consumption because that would look like self advertising or a political striptease
7137490 indeed russia and the u s were allies during the two tragic conflicts of the second and the first world wars which allows us to think theres something objectively bringing us together in difficult times and i think i believe it has to do with geopolitical interests and also has a moral component the ability to compromise is not a diplomatic politeness toward a partner but rather taking into account and respecting your partners legitimate interests
7137491 we were thinking about each others interests and at the same time about the interests of the country in question the problems the issues we were trying to address based on such an approach in the end we resolved the issue to a large extent at the same time where we fail to be guided by those basic principles where we push forward some economic or political self interest we fail to arrive at solutions that would realistically address the issue where we try to take into account each others interest we achieve lasting results
7137492 the bloc system of relations must be replaced by an altogether different system based on common rules that are called international law and those rules should be strictly abided by at the end of the day only this may ensure stability and respect for the interest of small nations and not just large ones and superpowers like the united states
7137493 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
7137494 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
7137495 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
7137496 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7137497 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
7137498 there was no significant loss of life in those towers

7137523 he will forgive people but his baluch roots never allow him to forget the old rivalries still play out in the back of his mind
7137524 its got a kind of status you can go to the lip and sometimes if its not erupting you will see an active vent with smoke and steam coming out of it
7137525 a lot of people try to get there not realising its current state of activity
7137526 its off the north west coast of java and is certainly a bit of a haul but there are plenty of people willing to hire a boat and make the voyage
7137527 if it stopped erupting if ash stopped coming out of it it would be colonised by tropical vegetation very quickly
7137528 the problem around krakatoa was that there was a big population living around the sumatran and javan shores and because they were only a few kilometres away they copped a lot of it but the tsunami was relatively trivial in size
7137529 it was wrongly spelt on the telegraph when the news was sent to london and its been corrupted by the brits ever since
7137530 i was speaking with some of my classmates who were becoming doctors and lawyers and other people who could have an impact on the world and i started to wonder how i might be able to do that fixing typos was what i came up with ive always been aware of typos wherever i go and i figured that it was a national problem
7137531 other venues where innocent eyes may be befouled by the vile stains on the delicate fabric of our language
7137532 certainly there are a lot more people out there now carrying sharpies a brand of marker pen around with them
7137533 bless your heart for reassuring me that i am not the only spelling and punctuation nut left in north america
7137534 its very demeaning to be standing here but at the moment we dont have any other way to get food
7137535 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7137536 parents are so worried about their unmarried offspring that they feel they have to do something
7137537 our son doesnt know were here but we hope hell be pleased
7137538 our reports from our own forces on the ground are only so far that those killed in the strikes were 30 and they were all militants
7137539 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously an investigation has been directed
7137540 the united nations has always made clear that civilian casualties are unacceptable they undermine the trust and confidence of the afghan people
7137541 every effort that can be made must be made to ensure the safety and welfare of the civilian population where military operations are conducted
7137542 its tragic marcus had spent two to three weeks here with his father before he went on holiday
7137543 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7137544 friend i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate
7137545 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgement who doesnt have to hide behind bluster
7137546 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7137547 he has disdain for privilege and for limousine liberals the mark of an honest working class democrat
7137548 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7137549 the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through dangerous waters internationally
7137550 i got elected when i was 29 and i got elected november the 7th and on december 18th of that year my wife and three kids were christmas shopping for a christmas tree a tractor trailer a guy who allegedly and i never pursued it drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch broadsided my family and killed my wife instantly and killed my daughter instantly and hospitalised my two sons with what were thought to be at the time permanent fundamental injuries
7137551 i felt the plane judder violently to the left and then right before it went down
7137552 then i felt a sharp blow in my chest that sent me flying several metres i ended up in a ditch with water in it which must have protected me from the flames
7137553 flight attendants usually sit at the rear of the plane but i was right at the front in seat 1e that part of the plane was hardly burnt it was a miracle
7137554 all around me i could hear people crying out for help they were shouting and calling desperately but i couldnt move i couldnt do anything a few minutes later i heard the sirens of the rescue teams i knew they were going to save me
7137555 we feared the worst there were more and more dead how could she have survived
7137556 they lied to me my daughters dead and they lied
7137557 its a miracle when i heard she was alive i expected shed be covered in burns and would have lost her hair but no its all there
7137558 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7137559 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7137560 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7137561 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7137562 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7137563 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7137564 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7137565 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7137566 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7137567 that little 10 mph wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer
7137568 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through
7137569 he said the kids were getting mad and said it might be better not to play anything
7137570 soy un perdedor im a loser baby so why dont you kill me
7137571 and as he started to go she said billy keep your head low billy dont be a hero come back to me
7137572 and the last game of the season is a friday night at home no one knows the reason but the blind man didnt come
7137573 when my back is broken when the mountain moves away all the dreams and promises that we give we give away sometimes you kick sometimes you get kicked

7137576 but i felt like i got stronger as the game wore on i was able to maintain myself
7137577 my motivation is one reason and one reason only and thats to get to the playoffs and win the world series
7137578 a obra em quest o foi organizada para suprir uma grave lacuna verificada na literatura especializada publicada no brasil que a an lise acurada e circunstanciada da pol tica externa brasileira desde o in cio dos anos noventa
7137579 an evening with wiki inventor ward cunningham in conversation with john gage
7137580 o horizonte regional do brasil e a constru o da am rica do sul 1990 2005
7137581 it can definitely go down to the last race its quite possible dixon said on saturday
7137582 wed have to turn out for the last two races but thats about it dixon said
7137583 so if we can do that that would be amazing
7137584 but those guys have already proven theyre very fast here so thats going to be very tough to do
7137585 those guys on our team did a great job if you close your eyes you cant tell the difference from the primary car
7137586 it does worry you because it kind of drags out a bit he said
7137587 its so easy these days to have a mechanical failure on a car thats performing so highly be it the engine the gearbox or even something else
7137588 weve got a lot of hard work to do yet
7137589 if theres a chance were not going to give up he added
7137590 were trying to make the gap in the championship closer but tomorrows going to be tough the times are ridiculous just so close its going to be very hard to pass
7137591 fortunately weve been quick in sonoma in each visit but we havent been able to bring home a win he said
7137592 weve finished in the top five the past two years and i really want to take it to the next level this season in order to keep the championship battle going
7137593 were not out of it but were going to need a strong run to be able to stay in the fight
7137594 war schon toll was die jungs in den zweiten 45 minuten geliefert haben
7137595 ich will die zeitlupen gar nicht sehen das ist nun mal passiert
7137596 van bommel hatte gelb und muss doch aufpassen aber er ist in jedem spiel gef hrdet das ist der unbeherrschte charakter in ihm
7137597 das erste gelb war okay die zweite aktion war keine absicht sonst w re es ja glatt rot gewesen
7137598 die mannschaft hatte zu wenig zutrauen zu sich die aggressivit t im spiel nach vorne hat gefehlt
7137599 dar prosseguimento s dilig ncias administrativas dentro das formas da lei no marrocos
7137600 n s estamos fazendo tudo dentro das regras n s temos um verdadeiro projeto para o futuro
7137601 a entrega de um visto para um a estrangeiro a destinada a permitir que ele a se case na fran a com uma pessoa francesa muito excepcional na imensa maioria dos casos o visto negado e os casais s o obrigados quer a se casarem no exterior quer a solicitarem um visto de turismo para o c njuge n o franc s
7137602 gartner is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race national origin religion color gender sexual orientation age non disqualifying physical or mental disability or any other basis covered by law employment decisions are based solely on qualifications and business need
7137603 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
7137604 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this labour government
7137605 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
7137606 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7137607 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7137608 it can be embarassing to come to school without supplies on the first day
7137609 i really appreciate them doing this for the community and the teachers
7137610 in the special education department we have little buckets that we carry around for the kids and we want to supply those with things that they need so that children arent stressing out
7137611 its a real motivator for them they get excited to have new stuff it helps them to be ready to go
7137612 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7137613 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7137614 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7137615 this year superdelegates comprised 20 of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7137616 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7137617 the devil is in the details and thats not something to get into in a national convention
7137618 el modelo de concertaci n es el que n stor kirchner convoc en la plaza de mayo que tiene que ver con el sentido de productividad que debe tener la sociedad y con la profunda responsabilidad en la distribuci n
7137619 con el modelo que propuso n stor kirchner primero y que ahora contin a
7137620 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7137621 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7137622 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7137623 the peace process must be anchored on justice hence the milf must turn in commanders umbra kato bravo and pangalian to face the bar of justice
7137624 there is no all out war only all out peace in mindanao
7137625 the campaign we are waging is intended to remove the obstacles to peace
7137626 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7137627 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7137628 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7137629 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7137630 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7137631 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7137632 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7137633 they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7137634 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7137635 you progress not through improving what has been done but reaching toward what has yet to be done
7137636 musharraf was a curse on our country he was a friend of america and an enemy of islam
7137637 he will be accountable for his crimes in the next world and in this one too i hope he has done the work of the unbeliever and killed so many innocent muslims
7137638 the army is determined to continue with the war against militants but it can only be won with political backing to convince the people that it is their war and not americas
7137639 the system is the same you see new faces in power but nothing more
7137640 the state has failed in pakistan if people want to do anything here they have to do it for themselves
7137641 washington is asking what the hell is going to happen to the war on terror insurgency is like a disease now in pakistan it is spreading outside the tribal areas and the signs are that it is going to be messy for some time to come the concerns are where do we go from here and how do we deal with those guys who are hiding out in pakistan and hitting our soldiers in afghanistan
7137642 the war is on our soil and our boys are dying we will defend our land we are tough on extremism but we need to have democratic wisdom rather than a martial mindset it is in our interest that this war on pakistan is won by us
7137643 so many things have gone wrong but it was demonstrations by the people that got rid of musharraf and that gives our country a new chance
7137644 kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless
7137645 in any contest between power and patience bet on patience
7137646 weve got all the confidence in the world in clint and his team weve got some things working for that as well weve got our work cut out for us the next three weeks and thats what were concentrating on right now is to get through into the chase weve got to get through that and once we do that well start addressing other things
7137647 in my conversations with hendrick its that im going to be in the 5 for the remainder of the year
7137648 you never know things change obviously or else i wouldnt be making these decisions this year but from everything that i know thats not going to be an issue
7137649 obviously uncle jack is a good brand to tie your name to
7137650 ive enjoyed it its been fun casey will do a good job with it obviously hes a pretty good looking dude so hell be able to market good
7137651 the biggest thing is its all about teamwork and making rcr bigger and better jeff kevin and i all three know we need a fourth driver a fourth team to be able to bring resources in and make our teams better no matter who those teams are make us as drivers better
7137652 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7137653 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7137654 dude youve already demonstrated that unlike me youre not familiar with even the basic facts of either 9 11 or the so called war on terror so what aside from sheer self righteous arrogance makes you think youre more informed about this than i am
7137655 wat een sukkel weet niet eens hoe je email moet schrijven
7137656 when he ascended on high he led captives in his trainand gave gifts to men
7137657 whats the best way to protect yourself from a knife
7137658 i think that magazine shows with a strong talk show element like ours are a dying breed and most talk shows these days are comedic vehicles theres jonathan ross or paul ogrady
7137659 the arena in which the conversations are taking place is much more of an upbeat entertainment circus we come from a journalistic school and our approach to interviews is quite linear although we can go off piste quite a lot
7137660 i think that has an absolute place but sometimes that kind of questioning can become slightly relentless to a listener or viewer
7137661 in my experience a confrontational approach tends not to yield the answer you are going for when finnegan asked clinton about her husbands affair you could see up until then the interview had been conducted with a clear pane of bulletproof glass between them and it just came down
7137662 if you are really confrontational to someone obviously the animal response is to pull right back and put up defences to me that is not an interview lots of people think that that gladiatorial style is the way to go with politicians i personally dont
7137663 if you go on a reality show you surrender all freedom of will you are manipulated and controlled
7137664 i cant think of anything worse than surrendering my privacy and my dignity
7137665 i couldnt bear it i will never do a reality television show psychologically it is absolutely merciless
7137666 celebrity culture is a reality and celebrity has become currency in a way that it wasnt when we started it carries a huge comets tail of issues and short term value
7137667 we will not negotiate with those who are attacking you who are attacking the poor people
7137668 they attack the poor labourers they want to snatch their livelihoods we strongly condemn such attacks against poor people
7137669 our tribesmen are patriotic people and we will negotiate with those tribes who isolate themselves from the militants
7137670 we are working for the economic uplift and development of the tribal areas
7137671 they are a handful of elements who are creating unrest the majority of people in pakistan are patriotic and peace loving the enemies of the country are behind those miscreants
7137672 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7137673 our life is shaped by our mind we become what we think suffering follows an evil thought as the wheels of a cart follow the oxen that draws it our life is shaped by our mind we become what we think joy follows a pure thought like a shadow that never leaves
7137674 try hanging that outside a west end theatre see who buys a ticket
7137675 do we really want that i hope not televisions at its best when high and low intertwine lets keep the road as wide as possible so we can all travel down it
7137676 televisions been broad inclusive and varied for 50 years why on earth would it want to change now
7137677 let me be absolutely clear if the gulf between the cost and benefit of itv holding these licences widens the licence handback becomes unarguable
7137678 all eyes are now on ofcoms next psb document due out in september when we will see whether or not they understand the necessity for urgent deregulation
7137679 the firing of telegraph foreign staff was the best thing ever to happen to me
7137680 to be fair its not all mountfords fault hes just a yes man for people higher up in fact hes known as noddy as he just nods and obeys
7137681 it will be the day after the evening standard closes
7137682 with the sales at a historic low and bulks increasing at a staggering rate the standard bulks look set to overtake paid for sales by the end of the summer
7137683 we are reaping the benefits when utilising some of the stories from the standard and subbing them down
7137684 we have always been in the same newsroom and will always be looking for synergies between the two products
7137685 the crossover between metro london lite and thelondonpaper means you are building in frequency as opposed to a wider audience
7137686 theres a fundamental issue in what we are prepared to pay for it
7137687 i think thelondonpaper will stick with it but i dont see why
7137688 we are still on track to be profitable in five years their profits are a long way off and their tactics are not going their way
7137689 stop wasting all your time playing xbox and actually write
7137690 we have decided we want to continue with the show we enjoy it too much to stop altogether
7137691 it wont happen straight away because were still mourning humphrey
7137692 we had thousands of emails when humph died saying do please continue
7137693 im sure stephen would be good hes very funny and hes excellent on qi
7137694 we all had our favourites but mine would be a woman because then she couldnt be compared to humph
7137695 humph had big shoes to fill and i wouldnt do it
7137696 nietzsche said that life was a choice between suffering and boredom he never said anything about having to put up with both at the same time
7137697 excellent numeracy and literacy skills as well as charm and charisma
7137698 as the countdown to a brand new channel ends a brand new countdown begins
7137699 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people but this new advert places the product in a very sexualised and provocative context
7137700 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
7137701 kidscapes main concern is that this is yet another example of the blatant use of sexual images to sell products to young people
7137702 we are looking at the complaints and havent made a decision about whether or not to investigate yet this is a question of taste and decency
7137703 joe biden is a long time member of the u s senate committee on the judiciary which he chaired from 1987 until 1995 and served as ranking minority member from 1981 until 1987 and again from 1995 until 1997 while chairman biden presided over two of the most contentious supreme court confirmation hearings of robert bork in 1987 and clarence thomas in 1991

7137707 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games
7137708 irreparably harmed by senator mccains illegal and illegitimate presence on the ballot
7137709 the harm sustained by being forced to compete against and potentially be defeated by and illegal and illegitimate campaign cannot be monetarily remedied nor can it be remedied after the november general election in any manner
7137710 her robe was hanging wide open and she was flashing us her tits
7137711 yeah i did notice it was opening in the front but i couldnt really see much other than her cleavage
7137712 god from where i was i could see it all
7137713 wow youre really living up to your reputation megan told amanda you could stay hard and outfuck her lucky for me

7137717 josef you go though life and get all this positive energy and all the sadness you just throw it behind you and it drops into the bag you carry on your back then when you photograph it all comes out
7137718 my mother just said how much she would love a big plate of mashed potatoes with caraway seed
7137719 how can i have such a man in my house

7137721 henri i love his pictures but i do not need to meet him
7137722 no you do not understand you have to meet him because we three we are of the same family
7137723 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7137724 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7137725 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb

7137733 quality is a customer determination not an engineers determination not a marketing determination or a general management determination it is based upon the customers actual experience with the product or service measured against his her requirements stated or unstated conscious or merely sensed and always represents a moving target
7137734 ive been to barry where the show is set three times and now desperately want to go back
7137735 some administrators view the clingy material as too tight emphasizing the anatomy rather than the athleticism of those wearing it
7137736 in my entire coaching career i ve never heard of anyone objecting to spandex
7137737 my players want to compete in what they practice in and i need to be their advocate
7137738 there s no policy against swimmers gymnasts and majorettes wearing tight outfits there s been no word on lengthening cheerleaders skirts

7137813 we have always loved france and had spent many holidays there
7137814 we wanted a large property next to water and close to a village that we could renovate and build up to be a bed amp breakfast business
7137815 as soon as we drove up the drive to ch teau caillac everything felt right
7137816 the original features along with modern plumbing and electrics were ideal we fell in love with it there and then
7137817 it is not that we had any doubt about the french healthcare system
7137818 it was simply that as and when my health started to deteriorate i wanted to be with family and friends i had to prioritise what is important to me
7137819 well stay close to our business for the foreseeable future
7137820 maybe one day well be able to buy ourselves a small place in france
7137821 must have failed to integrate in other words they didnt try hard enough
7137822 we have had a mixed reaction from the local community
7137823 i suppose you could detect some feeling of betrayal but i dont feel that weve failed theres an element of miscalculation maybe in that i thought it would be easier to work from here than it turned out to be perhaps that was naive
7137824 but archie didnt get the most out of the village school and we felt that the private sector in the uk had a more rounded education
7137825 in tarn we could go out and leave the front doors open but it isnt all lovely it can be very bleak and cold during the winter and the whole region seems to go into hibernation
7137826 when we left the uk our four children were single and working in the london area
7137827 they would come out for holidays and we would have quality time together
7137828 i want to be there when my grandchildren are born i feel i am too far away here
7137829 we have thoroughly enjoyed our time at ch teau caillac and we will be very sad to say goodbye
7137830 the local people of fongrave have been kind and welcoming even though at times our french has been less than perfect
7137831 there are many things we will miss eating outside with friends and family overlooking the river relaxing by our pool walking down to the village to get the bread each morning and stopping for a coffee and a chat with the locals summer evenings at the farmers markets tasting the delicious local produce swapping home made yogurt for fresh fruit at the farm shop walking our dogs around our lovely grounds
7137832 youve escaped from your daily life and theres a fantasy about never going back
7137833 you stand outside an agents window see a pretty house and mentally youre planning a new life
7137834 if you dont do it while youre there youre never going to do it
7137835 most people who look at houses in august never buy
7137836 they see something and think god i could afford that theyre not really serious often when the sun comes out they lose interest
7137837 if you suspect someone is a time waster and they turn out to be a genuine buyer it can cause great offence and ultimately lose a sale
7137838 we have to handle tourists who are potential purchasers very delicately
7137839 we pick them up from their hotels with a driver and usually end up giving a running commentary of the area if they really are in the buying mood we are usually able to find them something suitable
7137840 but we ended up buying the castle two hours later when i got back home i said what have i done but it turned out to be a good investment
7137841 they always have their eyes open for whatever it might be a wonderful house or some derelict land theyre always looking for an opportunity
7137842 its easy to spot the positives but the negatives can be well masked especially when the sun is shining for most it would make more sense to stay regularly in a hotel or rent a property unless youre planning to spend a huge amount of time there the figures just dont stack up
7137843 many people including myself allow emotion to overrule the brain its a roll of a dice but if the house is in a lovely area the chances of losing money are low and you will certainly have the pleasure and enjoyment of it
7137844 i went to the rockies and rafted down the rapids and went to a rodeo in the next 36 months i think prices there will go up 50 per cent meanwhile ill have a lot of fun
7137845 theyre lovely to think about on the way to the office and i go to sleep thinking about the hummingbirds at my home in grenada its so much better than a sleeping pill

7137851 people are given an eta for the ships arrival and expect their stuff to arrive at their house on the same day
7137852 you may have to pay for renting the container for longer or pay a port storage fee generally speaking people should anticipate delivery within 10 days of the eta
7137853 its no different to long distance removals in this country

7137859 time magazine has once again placed the obamessiah on its cover
7137860 baracksploitation for the practice among editors of putting only barack obama on the cover of their magazines
7137861 survey data is beginning to identify what some people are calling obama fatigue
7137862 he may have predicated too much of his campaign on biography
7137863 that only takes you so far in a general election the coverage may be too much about obama and not enough for obamas cause about his ideas
7137864 theres an undeniable sense among a lot of regular americans that the press has a perspective on political campaigns
7137865 we frankly think its more about senator obamas global celebrity than anything else
7137866 conservative family ties are very strong in turkey there is widespread prejudice against widows or divorced women many see them as a threat to their families these women however are faced with multiple difficulties on the one hand they are trying to continue their lives despite all the difficulties and on the other they are trying to overcome this prejudice
7137867 widows are deemed to be pitied or excluded from society the objective of our association is to change this societal attitude
7137868 there is considerable pressure on widows and divorced women in our society these women are expected to stay in their homes and isolate themselves from the outer world so that no rumors about them arise such psychological pressure makes their situation even more difficult when these women are challenged by economic problems they withdraw into their own shells
7137869 they dont realize that that life can still begin anew after they become widows they should exert their utmost to cling to life instead of withdrawing into their shells
7137870 divorced women in particular should tell their children that they will be happier in life after the divorce of their parents
7137871 the divorce rate in our country has increased rapidly over the past few years around 60 percent of divorced couples have children the main objective of our association is to give assistance to women with children who dont have a partner in life any more
7137872 it is not possible to say that only widows or divorced women are subject to discrimination or prejudice in society other women complain about similar problems as well if we want to improve the position of women in the society then we need to make people accept the fact that women are equal to men
7137873 the third national program is important in the sense that it defines the priorities of the government
7137874 we should see the third national program as a golden chance to get out of this atmosphere
7137875 turkey needed these environmental investments long ago we are still piling garbage at dump sites waste is poured directly into streams without any treatment the expense may be high but turkey is strong enough to handle it
7137876 the investments that will be made for the environment will decrease expenditures on health issues this is not a one way spending mechanism
7137877 but this was not an automatically activated inspection mechanism it was to be done by parliament in the name of the court of accounts only when the deputies asked to do so the problem in turkey is not the ability of the government to pass laws making new regulations but to pass the bylaws and standing orders to activate those laws the bylaw of inspection of army expenditures by the court of accounts has not been passed yet we have a country where certain protocols and bylaws have more power than laws look at the bylaw of the national security council mgk only with a civilian and military consensus can these be changed
7137878 if for instance the bylaw that will codify the inspection of military expenditures incorporates a precondition of confidentiality that kind of an inspection will not be a valid one
7137879 armenia was always in favor of dialogue and talks particularly on the issues concerning cooperation and security in our region the turkish prime ministers statement on the intention to start talks with armenia on this agenda could be welcomed
7137880 during the conversation mr babacan conveyed our concrete proposals concerning the caucasia stability and cooperation platform to the russian side
7137881 osce the organization for security and co operation in europe is ineffective in regards to the nagorno karabakh issue since russia is one of the co chairs in the osce minsk group if such a caucasia platform is established russias participation in this body is inevitable and if turkey can get russia and georgia together under the same roof then this will be a success by itself
7137882 both russia and georgia do not want to give up south ossetia and abkhazia at the same time however there may be a bargaining on the two regions while georgia will definitely be very stubborn as it considers both of the regions its own soil on the other side there is a deep lack of confidence vis vis russia a lack of confidence which makes expectation of great consequences from this platform in the short run very difficult russias main goal was to topple saakashvili with its recent move it would either walk to tbilisi in order to enter the capital or it would force georgia to give major concessions like withdrawing half of its troops from the disputed regions nevertheless none took place and it seems saakashvili will remain in power for a considerable time thus russia couldnt reach its eventual goal
7137883 what could happen is this the parties come together around the same table and they can take steps regarding secondary issues related to nagorno karabakh for example the refugee issue in the long run russia has a tendency to introduce the issues of nagorno karabakh south ossetia and abkhazia in one package which will not be acceptable for a large majority of the international community because the situation in nagorno karabakh is entirely different from all others since armenia is de facto on azerbaijan soil via invading nagorno karabakh following the unilateral declaration of kosovos independence and its recognition by the world russia has become increasingly aggressive concerning the issue of nagorno karabakh but it is impossible to put these issues in the same file neither geographically nor historically can this be done even looking at the significant differences of population between kosovo and these regions make this point clear
7137884 we also have this triangle of caucasia the united states and turkey the us is actually looking favorably at all kinds of moves of rapprochement between turkey and armenia yet a significant step by armenia is not easy to be taken in the short term due to the clout of the hard liner karabakh clan with the leadership of the country as a matter of fact turkeys conditions for reopening the border and re establishing diplomatic relations are quite moderate
7137885 if someone has a better idea then s he should come forward and tell us this better idea
7137886 such an initiative could not be taken without having russias consent and turkey gained this consent nobody takes initiatives with consequences or success being taken for granted as there is always a calculated risk when turkey initiated the black sea economic cooperation back in the early 1990s the same kinds of comments were made suggesting that the idea was not realistic at all but it took off later it lost its vigorousness due to neglect by the governments of the time starting from 1996
7137887 unfortunately the coalition government led by late prime minister b lent ecevit and the next president ahmet necdet sezer neglected the idea put forward by demirel purely on political concerns since it was not first floated by them and it failed before it was born
7137888 when governments give clear signals about their priorities the people of turkey read this message and act accordingly and make the necessary sacrifices falling on their shoulders in the case of the absence of clear signals and messages extreme ideas such as turkey joining the shanghai five or its establishing a new front with iran and russia gain currency in the town
7137889 but now it needs sustainable power and it cannot rely forever and solely upon the ups and downs in natural gas prices to maintain its power
7137890 i find comments suggesting that a new cold war era has started as exaggerated but it is obvious that the cards are being redistributed and that this is happening putting forward constructive and positive ideas as ankara has been doing is extremely good
7137891 the fact that this idea has not been rejected spells that it will be able to stand on its own feet even if these five countries come together and set a date for their second meeting without making a concrete decision over disputed issues this will be a real success
7137892 i hadnt been briefed that that was going to happen we have a partnership with turkey on the caucasus and i presume that well be able to work together very closely now with our allies in turkey since we do have clearly shared interests not to mention values throughout the caucasus with our turkish ally
7137893 russias actions in gori led to an environment of cold war and washington was actually not expecting such action by russia which fuelled already existing doubts over moscows respect for georgias sovereignty all of these facts might have led to such a distanced manner by the united states however in the long term this platform is also in the interest of the united states
7137894 then we were discussing the involvement of the united states and iran in the issue today there is no us aspect of the issue at the time being but washington should definitely be persuaded to effectively support this initiative
7137895 the western world in general for example via nato and the united states in particular should be appropriately briefed that their interests in the region will be protected in this regard mr babacans telephone talks are very positive yet i believe that the level should be upgraded with mr prime minister recep tayyip erdo an holding talks with eu term president frances leader nicolas sarkozy as well as with the eus foreign policy chief javier solana
7137896 we the undersigned are unconditionally opposed to the use of video surveillance cameras in public places we are also opposed to the use of surveillance cameras that though installed in privately owned places are actually used to monitor the public we believe that both types of cameras in addition to being useless in the wars on crime and terrorism are tools that are all too frequently used to violate our rights to privacy anonymity dignity and political dissent
7137897 cameras are not the only threats to our rights government agencies and private security firms also use wiretaps bugs gps transponders rfid chips and computers dedicated to data gathering retention and mining but we choose to focus on video surveillance cameras because they are the most visible manifestation of the emerging surveillance society
7137898 in this world of electronics there is nothing that cannot be deciphered bugged or mined
7137899 never mind phone tapping even your conversations at home can be heard outside your home if the right kind of antenna is directed toward you
7137900 the freedom to communicate using high tech devices connected to satellites has also been promoted as a method of ensuring security but it also makes it easier to wiretap or watch everyone else a fact rarely mentioned by those who praise these new technologies people usually sacrifice their right to privacy in exchange for security measures that are expensive and in fact restrictive to freedoms
7137901 the ip address and isp internet service provider number of a user on the internet are quite like caller id systems displaying phone numbers ip numbers are visible the minute a user connects to a site over the internet so if someone wishes they can track the sites you have been to using your ip number and how much time you spend there
7137902 following a trauma people feel mutually shared feelings like desperation and concern in such instances a collective urge to give up rights and freedoms for more security might emerge

7137909 o vasco vinha numa fase ruim mas j superou isso subiu de produ o e conseguiu uma boa arrancada
7137910 o botafogo vem numa crescente conseguiu vencer tr s jogos seguidos fora de casa e vem dando conta do recado dentro de casa mas ainda precisamos recuperar alguns pontos perdidos justamente no engenh o como a derrota para a portuguesa 1 a 0 e o pr prio empate com o vasco se tiv ssemos com esses pontos estar amos ainda melhores na tabela por isso importante recuper los nos cl ssicos

7137912 didnt arrive until the middle of the 19th century by which time cricket had been up and running for 200 years longer and you have to ask why whats it for what does it do or provide that couldnt be done or provided by some other and much simpler means without cricket would the history of the world have been different

7137915 i see myself as an agent for change there to help government officials look at things in a different way and also empower those responsible for public assets to be allowed to make sensible decisions about them
7137916 i have a high respect for the treasury and i think it is good for the country that some spring cleaning is done from time to time
7137917 because the budget position is so bad the labour party will do anything to realise cash without necessarily trying to get best value for the taxpayer
7137918 the worry is that the treasury has no commercial acumen at all
7137919 people have this vision of what this type of waste is but it does not have to glow green and ooze down the corridor to be hazardous
7137920 of course they are major businesses and could pick us up but they are focused on much wider activities than augean is we focus exclusively on the hazardous waste sub sector
7137921 if i deliver i will want to get the fruits of my labour this is a long term infrastructure development business but i think it is important that we are able to demonstrate progress year on year
7137922 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7137923 we were still very low very close to the ground
7137924 i saw the watch was not his nor the t shirt
7137925 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7137926 i thought that if there was something wrong the right thing to do is switch planes
7137927 i told my husband they should put us on another plane
7137928 im so proud of what britain has achieved and now im really excited about london 2012
7137929 ive never regularly played the national lottery but now im going to buy a ticket every week whats been achieved so far is amazing
7137930 we have been thrilled with the coverage over the last few weeks because its the first time our story has really been told about where the money has gone its just been incredible
7137931 it is nothing to do with camelot we dont allocate any money we just raise it but if people are going to play more games because of this just think what difference that can make
7137932 i heard this radio interview it really got to me matthew said that if anyone was prepared to fund british rowers they would always come up with the goods
7137933 in an ideal world i see myself sitting in the stands as the olympic flame is extinguished at the end of the london games and gently waving goodbye
7137934 this could never happen with our knowledge or approval and we investigated the situation as a matter of urgency
7137935 it will be a major fillip for the sector if maud can pull this off

7137943 in its handling of this sale the government has subordinated the value consideration to matters of policy and cash
7137944 of course we would be sellers of british energy at the right price but our analysis of the company shows that this is significantly higher than the 765p a share edf offered
7137945 quality british programmes are more under threat than a lot of politicians realise
7137946 the danger is this debate takes another three or four years and the damage will be irretrievable
7137947 if we squabble amongst ourselves the politicians are in danger of being let off the hook theres a real danger this gets put into the in tray post another election
7137948 if you try and have one of those grand communications acts it gets too complicated
7137949 the outlook for our us military and national security markets remains robust and we are confident that we will be slightly ahead of our growth targets for the year we continue to seek acquisitions in a consolidating industry which are likely to allow us to accelerate our strategy further

7137954 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7137955 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7137956 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbour instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7137957 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7137958 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7137959 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7137960 we are halfway through the reporting season and there have been some good results which helping in getting momentum
7137961 the overall market will benefit retailers will gain from increased confidence in the market from oil falling
7137962 the rise in wall street will also send a good signal
7137963 the market could gain 60 or 70 points on monday
7137964 the oil price has been trending down for a while now and this bodes well for most industrials
7137965 any industry with a strong oil component such as transport or manufacturing will do well from falling oil prices
7137966 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato

7137989 but not the scale of it exam results apart we found clear evidence that august born babies were far more likely to be assessed wrongly as having special educational needs

7137996 early indications are that these criminals have been tampering with retailers chip and pin terminals in order to steal card transaction data and pins from these machines
7137997 to date compromised chip and pin terminals have been found in less than 30 retail outlets throughout the uk together with the banking and retail industries we are working to ensure this figure is minimised
7137998 in the unlikely event a cardholder is an innocent victim of this or any type of fraud they enjoy excellent protection under the banking code which means that they will not suffer any financial loss
7137999 now its not just cash machines its every card reader in every shop or restaurant
7138000 the pin access devices are being re engineered it seems like crooks have broken the encryption on the chip but this is unclear
7138001 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action
7138002 while the investigation into the intrusion is ongoing our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers
7138003 an intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only
7138004 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them
7138005 last week we discovered that some fedora servers were illegally accessed the intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered and the servers were taken offline
7138006 security specialists and administrators have been working since then to analyze the intrusion and the extent of the compromise as well as reinstall fedora systems
7138007 based on our review to date the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and the passphrase is not stored on any of the fedora servers
7138008 the effects of the intrusion on fedora and red hat are not the same
7138009 accordingly the fedora package signing key is not connected to and is different from the one used to sign red hat enterprise linux packages
7138010 i find some of the guidelines to be a bit far fetched especially cctv monitoring of each terminal
7138011 this will cost a lot of additional money to protect the chip and pin systems the scary thing with this attack is its so hard to detect with atm skimming its much easier to detect that the machine has been tampered with
7138012 recommending placing cctv coverage of tills allows crooks to harvest cardholders pins during a transaction
7138013 from a cardholder security perspective this is clearly undesirable especially when apacs requires cardholders to be diligent with keeping their pins secret or face the loss when fraudsters withdraw money from their accounts using fake cards
7138014 payment equipment should have been properly tamper proofed and designed such that swapping peds is made very difficult
7138015 i am astounded at just how easy criminals are able to get access to chip and pin machines from companies large and small and how easy it seems to be that they can then bypass the security measures that are built in each machine at manufacture
7138016 i believe we are only 18 months to two years away from criminal gangs being able to clone a chip and pin card including the chip
7138017 it is challenging to mitigate xss in a way that balances the needs of compatibility security and performance
7138018 if you deploy a security feature already knowing how to work around it i think its more security theater than anything else

7138079 we dont expect to do to spain what we did last time
7138080 imposible no hay manera de pasear en p blico en ninguna parte del reino unido sin que me reconozcan principalmente porque por ejemplo en todos los bancos de santander de gran breta a hay fotos m as aparecen por todas partes en publicidad del banco de vodafone de reebok mi imagen est siempre a la vista en mi pa s soy muy conocido y eso acaba siendo una complicaci n
7138081 nadie le ganaba con los coches teledirigidos se notaba que ten a una sensibilidad especial
7138082 se or dennis alg n d a me gustar a poder pilotar uno de sus coches de f 1
7138083 t gana el campeonato brit nico de karts y dentro de unos a os volveremos a hablar
7138084 se me romp a el coraz n pero me daba cuenta de que no pod a interferir en el futuro de mi hijo era evidente que yo no podr a seguirle en su camino en cambio sab a que con anthony siempre encontrar a los recursos para poder avanzar
7138085 la gente habla de suerte pero yo no creo mucho en la suerte creo m s bien que la suerte se la va construyendo uno mismo creo que he sido muy afortunado de tener la oportunidad gracias a mi padre de empezar a competir en karting y despu s ganar la carrera de autosport conocer a ron dennis y que l me brindara la ocasi n de unirme al equipo y acabar corriendo con mclaren en la f 1 he sido muy afortunado pero tambi n ha habido mucha lucha y muy dura tanto para m como para mi familia cuando comenzamos en el karting no ten amos nada y fue una cuesti n de fe de esfuerzo y de trabajo para seguir creyendo e intentando hacerlo todo bien para conseguir el xito ha sido una lucha larga y dura
7138086 todo eso no deja de ser una consecuencia a veces incluso molesta de lo que yo considero xito no puedo entenderlo de otra forma que no sea la satisfacci n de haber realizado un trabajo bien hecho y de obtener el fruto de todo el sacrificio
7138087 sin duda me sorprende la vida que puedo llevar ahora
7138088 pero la mayor parte de las cosas que hago suponen para m un sacrificio que acept desde el momento en que decid ser piloto de f 1 el xito conlleva una gran responsabilidad y hay que cargar con ella estoy orgulloso de c mo lo estoy llevando
7138089 en aquel momento no me di cuenta de lo bueno que era
7138090 no entiendo por qu el equipo ha adelantado mis repostajes y me ha frenado en la parte final de la carrera
7138091 una vez estaba paseando tranquilamente por londres tras ver una pel cula en un cine con un amigo y su novia y al d a siguiente apareci en algunos diarios una fotograf a en la que se dec a que estaba con mi novia y mi guardaespaldas
7138092 es cierto que el xito abre puertas s lo el a o pasado asist a muchos actos y entregas de premios y conoc a muchas celebridades estrellas gente que son leyenda que siempre hab a respetado
7138093 ahora tengo la oportunidad de entablar amistad con gente as
7138094 es un dolo conocerle fue de las cosas m s grandes que me han ocurrido en mi vida me parece una persona extraordinaria una fuente de inspiraci n un h roe
7138095 soy todo coraz n es cierto que a veces eso te puede jugar una mala pasada e ir en tu contra puedes forzar en exceso intentar ir muy lejos demasiado pronto y entonces todo se vuelve en tu contra te da una patada en el culo y pagas el precio pero pienso que suelo estar bastante relajado y tranquilo en el coche creo que por naturaleza mi car cter es as relajado tranquilo racional y suave
7138096 l es as ofrece una sensaci n de tranquilidad de serenidad que he visto en muy pocos pilotos la ofrece fernando alonso tambi n la ten a michael schumacher pero no la vi en kimi raikkonen
7138097 hay que ser muy fuerte para soportar todo lo que comporta el acoso de los medios de comunicaci n y no permitir que ni eso ni el dinero y la fama acaben cambiando tu vida
7138098 lo m s importante es mantener los valores y las creencias si no todo eso resultar a insoportable creo que mi familia me educ bien y por tanto no veo ninguna raz n para cambiar intento mantener las cosas de mi vida igual que siempre pero por ejemplo siempre quise ser independiente y ahora tengo la oportunidad puedo pagar mis facturas la del tel fono el gas y el agua puedo comprarme un coche si quiero lo que sea mi profesi n me permite ahora vivir mi propia vida y eso me sienta muy bien
7138099 mi familia tiene un papel crucial en mi vida y siempre lo ha tenido
7138100 no podr a pasar ni un d a sin ellos son mi equipo de apoyo me ayudan me cuidan y me liberan de parte del estr s que produce ser piloto de f 1
7138101 es una de las mejores personas que conozco y creo que todos en la f 1 reconocen que es un personaje incre ble
7138102 es dif cil saber si mi imagen p blica es la m a real
7138103 creo que s que se ajusta bastante pero no del todo intento mantener el control de mi imagen y creo que el equipo me ayuda en este aspecto pero es cierto que hay rumores que no son necesariamente ciertos que cambian la percepci n que la gente tiene de ti sin embargo quienes me ven saben el tipo de persona que soy normal y corriente como pedro de la rosa que estaba a su lado en aquel momento con familias normales
7138104 cuando era muy peque o bamos cada semana a la iglesia pero cuando empec a competir no pod a porque ten a carreras no s lo mi familia inmediata tambi n mis t as mis primos todos somos muy religiosos y siento mi fe como algo muy cercano especialmente estos ltimos dos a os por eso hablo de ella tan libremente
7138105 were raw in some positions but it was a good test
7138106 we saw what we need to work on and what we did well
7138107 things have been going at melrose for years and years
7138108 spirit of american patriotism and independence away from true americans because of a few dollars
7138109 nosotros no podemos aceptar como naci n cuatro a os m s de esto no podemos permitirnos cuatro a os mas de un gobierno que no hizo nada mientras el mercado inmobiliario se hund a y a los estadounidenses les embargaban sus casas o ve an como se reduc a su valor sostuvo
7138110 en todo mi tiempo en el senado de estados unidos s lo cuatro congresistas lo superan en experiencia nunca vi a washington tan mal tantos sue os denegados ni tantos sue os aplazados por pol ticos que no se enfrentan a sus responsabilidades
7138111 i think a lot of us came over here expecting a dour repressed depressed recessed society and its been nothing like that this is a very upbeat booming place at least what were seeing of it
7138112 it will take about three hours to do the repairs and during that time about 300 people will be without power
7138113 none of us really had an opportunity to build soap box racers as kids so we are doing it now
7138114 we are trying to make it as stable as possible so it wont tip over no matter how fast we go or what we may crash into thankfully the course is padded with hay bales
7138115 our whole theme is we want to make a penguin fly so if you can imagine a penguin on his stomach with his flippers out stretched and a cape around his neck trying desperately to fly thats what our box will look like
7138116 we still have to get the chassis figured out and get a good steering and brake system going before we build the frame then we will cover the frame with a mold exterior of a penguin hopefully once its all airbrushed itll look pretty good and will run well
7138117 registration runs from 9 a m to 10 30 a m our 3 km dog walk begins at 10 30 a m with our 1 km furry scurry following right on its tail at 11 a m
7138118 the merchant mall will give you an opportunity to shop with many products and services on display from local vendors as well as the spca store with many bcspca products for sale
7138119 weve re branded our company so we thought it would be neat to give the artist community an outlet to paint
7138120 a lot of these people especially the graffiti artists dont really have anywhere to paint in the city so we thought this would be a great outlet for them as you can see we have kids and all sorts of people taking a stab at it
7138121 not at all we respect that the city is trying to get rid of graffiti but its not going to stop someone from being an artist and wanting to be an artist so this is a legal and safe way to do whatever you want on the side of a truck
7138122 ive always wanted to get some nozzles and try it out but i havent done any in spray paint this is the first one
7138123 the outlaw rebels gang has told australias biggest social motorcycle club the ulysses club to change their uniform or face enlightenment its gone from threats of violence to where rebel gang members are removing tags off our jackets if we dont do it we will be getting a flogging a 60 year old woman was among those threatened
7138124 police have alleged that five outlaw biker gangs have come together in a 22 million amphetamine trade crossing three states the rebels the nomads the gypsy jokers the finks and the hells angels
7138125 paul newman tiene c ncer de pulm n y le quedan semanas de vida
7138126 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7138127 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7138128 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7138129 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a barn in cedar rapids the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis thats because hes still that scrappy kid from scranton
7138130 barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story
7138131 were talking about a career politician for 36 years and so that completely changes the agenda and i can only assume thats because they found out how weak the experience issue was for obama
7138132 i know that joe doesnt back away from a fight
7138133 and if they want to try to swift vote us and throw us some curve balls were ready
7138134 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7138135 its a pretty hard experience hell have to decide which of the seven kitchen tables he has to sit at
7138136 its a very good choice i think im excited about it
7138137 and the thing is youre excited about it the two of them barack obama and joe biden come from urban communities so it could be the first time in a long time you have the two top officials coming from an urban environment
7138138 hes been in the senate for over 30 years so he knows mccain hell be able i believe to do some straight talk about mccain that barack will not be able to do
7138139 biden has a lot of experience he brings a lot to the table i think his being the foreign relations chairman makes it interesting
7138140 it gives us an expansion of our policy for whats going on in the world and i think it develops a little more of a wholeness to the obama biden ticket
7138141 that brings a lot of the northeastern and east coast population and that entire corridor into a more cohesive camp for obama
7138142 what happened in the last few days that justifies calling a general election
7138143 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
7138144 the review journal published a poll in todays editions revealing that 60 percent favor increasing the room tax to pay for education a move that will raise about 150 million to 185 million per year
7138145 exactly people dont mind soaking others for things they ought to be paying for themselves in this case its two easy targets casinos and tourists
7138146 how many of those people would walk into a 7 eleven fill up a big gulp grab some doritos and then tell the clerk to charge the guy whos next in line sure they might want to do that but how many would actually have the cojones to do it in person
7138147 not very many but theyll do it at the ballot box
7138148 the point is education benefits everybody in nevada and therefore everybody in nevada has an obligation to pay

7138153 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7138154 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7138155 wow i cant believe we were able to get media credentials

7138158 we are the best 400 meter guys in the world
7138159 when we got out here as a group we had one goal to get the gold
7138160 i felt strong and i could feel her kind of breaking down a bit
7138161 at about 120 meters she was still going so i tried to push her but its a different mentality when youre chasing yeah i like it better
7138162 i didnt quite have the extra gear in the last 200
7138163 its always a little disappointing when all things dont come together but its the olympics so i cant complain
7138164 i was going to hang out with guys and follow them at some point they went and i could not go i got slower and slower and slower
7138165 everyones a little bitter that we lost but we dont have anything to be disappointed about
7138166 i think all our girls are thinking like that you see tears but theyre tears of happiness we came a long way this tournament
7138167 we had to play the no 1 team in the world and we fought and we got a game off them and we actually could have taken them to five
7138168 were just thrilled its hard that it ends with a loss but we got a silver medal at the olympic games nothing that anyone on our team has ever gotten and its just been a wonderful experience
7138169 ive been off the court for a long time retired from playing so im very lucky to have this encouragement for me and my team
7138170 she took on a great team with a lot of potential it was a little rusty in the beginning but look where she got us she took us to a silver medal
7138171 ya me han convencido esta la tengo que ver cuidado que

7138179 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
7138180 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
7138181 i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well
7138182 for me it is as if ive won the champions league
7138183 there were some complications but now that everything is resolved i am really happy
7138184 we have succeeded in bringing back home the player who scored the most goals with our jersey in the last 50 years
7138185 andriy made a mistake to leave and i think that over the last two years he has realized that this is his home
7138186 now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that hes back with us
7138187 was okay but i have already forgotten most of it
7138188 about a guy that gets the gift of big dick
7138189 is way too long to be funny in any way
7138190 but haha they are french so what do you expect imdb link
7138191 and penny will see the evil me not a joke not a dork not a failure and she may cry but her tears will dry when i hand her the keys to a shiny new australia
7138192 i cant afford to lose you whod do what you do you are the tip of the fucking spear whos going to hold back the animals
7138193 haha the guy is a killer but goes to aa meetings
7138194 there are no more barriers to cross all i have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil all the mayhem i have caused and my utter indifference toward it i have now surpassed my pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better world for anyone in fact i want my pain to be inflicted on others i want no one to escape but even after admitting this there is no catharsis my punishment continues to elude me and i gain no deeper knowledge of myself no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling this confession has meant nothing
7138195 it has nothing to do with the first movie lions gate just wanted to make some money off the name fans of the first one will hate this people who hated the first one will love it
7138196 i didnt hate the first movie but i didnt like it it bugged the shit out of me the way it drowned itself in 80s pop culture
7138197 i think the people who really like the first movie seem to be those guys who are really into the fonts on their business cards
7138198 if ellis is drunk at parties and talks shit thats fine but if i could fight him id love to kick his ass
7138199 its not like a satire of american culture and its not going to be a commentary on psychosis or anything this is about a hot sexy superhero whos sort of the anti clarice starling
7138200 there are a number of high profile cases in which three or four areas of legislation are exposed such as bail and parole decisions that have failed people
7138201 some said we would be skating on thin ice but no one said we would actually be in breach of the act
7138202 the fire was well involved by the time we arrived but we managed to extinguish it quickly
7138203 i heard they have bought a lot of pig farms in nanping but they have not approached me yet
7138204 if they want to buy my farm i would say yes providing we have a win win agreement
7138205 i can sell one pig for 1 200 yuan or even 1 300 more than 80
7138206 the people i knew who graduated from my course were earning 1 500 a month
7138207 the chinese population enjoys pork no matter what economic cycle the world is in
7138208 the hog shortages throughout china are presenting us with historical land grabbing growth opportunities
7138209 our pig farming market is like the us in the 1960s or 1970s with lots of small backyard mom and pop producers there is a great opportunity to make money from scaling these operations up but the entrance of these big foreign firms will mean more competition for us
7138210 this is a good time for foreign buyers in the past two years around 40 per cent of the small farms have exited
7138211 a lot of farmers were wiped out last year so there are opportunists now entering the market
7138212 the problem is that individual farmers find it difficult to make money
7138213 it is a sellers market wholesale buyers come to our farms daily and we sell to the highest bidder if we refuse the painful alternative is for a buyer to go into villages and collect pigs one by one from individual farmers
7138214 this half year weve seen a substantial and sudden uplift in demand for advice on unsecured debt problems
7138215 in the past six weeks it has got even worse we reckon theres been an increase in calls of about 25 per cent
7138216 we make sure households classify debts as priority and non priority when they call for advice
7138217 priority is when you risk losing something like your house or your utilities
7138218 the issue now is the us slowdown and whether it enters a technical recession and what that does to the credit card and unsecured books
7138219 there are signs of increasing strain in the homeowner segment highlighted by the fact that almost 40 per cent of iva proposals are now coming from people who own property
7138220 historically over 50 per cent of struggling homeowners would refinance or remortgage themselves out of trouble but this option is less readily available today
7138221 the fact that we have had such a good games is so important
7138222 if it had been a disaster and the media had suggested the country was chucking money down the drain it would have been bad for 2012
7138223 the tier one sponsors have many reasons for doing it the teams success is just a fantastic added bonus
7138224 it is about brand association which can only be positive especially when the team has done so well
7138225 and it also has a phenomenal impact on employee engagement the cabin crew were ecstatic when they found out they would be on the flight taking the athletes home
7138226 for a challenger brand the olympics provides a fantastic point of difference
7138227 on the other hand for a company having a tough time the olympics can act as a unifier
7138228 it was particularly about making a bold statement of belief in itself as a bank there has been a perception of the bank as a relatively conservative organisation
7138229 the risk is that it all becomes a little like wallpaper if youre coke or mcdonalds people just expect to see your brand at major events
7138230 we want the awareness of our sponsorship to be there and at the moment we are quite a way from achieving that
7138231 over the next six months we have to make people realise we are a sponsor of london 2012
7138232 other sports will undoubtedly be approached by companies wanting to get on the olympic bandwagon
7138233 these results will energise the british public ahead of the london games the majority of visitors to london 2012 will be domestic visitors and no doubt great sporting expectations and results will help us deliver the 2012 tourism legacy
7138234 every time the government has lost data ministers have promised a crackdown but nothing has happened and a culture of complacency remains
7138235 civil penalties wont do the regrettable conclusion is that only the threat of a criminal sanction will change mindsets and jolt this government to ensure proper precautions in future
7138236 what we are very clear about is that all the security protocols as i understand it were maintained by the home office in terms of the encryption of data and passing the data on in encrypted form that has been downloaded not in encrypted form and thats where the breach appears to have happened
7138237 karena itu jangan sampai alergi terhadap politik hadirnya puluhan partai politik parpol diharapkan menjadi wadah bagi para politisi yang jujur dan ikhlas mengabdi kepada rakyat

7138239 saya mengharapkan gerindra menjadi partai yang bersih dan benar benar ingin mengabdi kepada rakyat indonesia dalam upaya memperbaiki kehidupan bangsa

7138242 dengan kenaikan sekarang pun pertamina masih rugi dalam penjualan elpiji 12 kg dan 50 kg sebesar rp6 5 triliun per tahun

7138249 has lost my vote my familys vote and i believe a large percent of hillary supporters
7138250 could have been an easy win for the democratic ticket i thought obama was smarter than that i guess i was wrong
7138251 no wonder obama revealed his choice in the dead of the night and buried this over the weekend
7138252 all hillary supporters will lick their wounds and support the obama biden ticket bidens experience will be invaluable as they decide what will work and what will not
7138253 brings instant credibility on foreign policy and the current inner workings of washington
7138254 sure obamas all about change but you dont get to real change without first understanding how the current system works and how to influence that process in a new direction
7138255 will allay the fears of floating voters who are leaning toward voting obama in november but have concerns over his limited foreign policy experience
7138256 will send shock down the spine of the mccain team which is making foreign policy the centerpiece of its campaign also bidens selection enhances obamas chances of winning in pa and doing well with blue collar voters
7138257 the speaker we heard on that sunny day in newark was the same joe biden that barack obama was thinking of when he made his vice presidential choice this week smart focused clear concise humorous and warmly engaging
7138258 in the face of the flood of cynicism and skepticism that characterizes so many of our views of washington politicians these days biden is one of the very few washington insiders who manages to maintain his constituents faith and hope and trust
7138259 i was waiting to see who obama was going to pick because i thought that would tell a lot about the direction he wanted to take his presidency
7138260 if hes willing to listen to biden hes heading in the right direction i think it really shows strength in his character that hes able to accept a man who really criticized him and to listen to him that says a lot about him
7138261 all of a sudden its not just about history and change and how far weve come since 1968 its about can we really move forward and yeah with that kind of ambition from obama and that kind of perseverance from biden we can do that
7138262 while i have nothing against joe biden i am disgusted and for the first time ever i have no clue who to vote for i know obamas big message is change so he picks a running mate that has been in dc longer than i have been old enough to vote he picked biden because of his experience which sounds logical but how is he going to change with a certified member of old washington on the ticket
7138263 bidens irish catholic working class roots are ones that i can relate to as an hispanic voter i remember sen biden during the gulf war and have always thought he was a straight shooter and very credible statesman sen biden provides the wisdom factor he is truly a senior statesman and his foreign policy experience is very reassuring during these times sen biden more than makes up for all the shortcomings that obama has in my opinion im elated that he has been chosen for vp position this kind of leadership is exactly what the democratic party and our country needs
7138264 obamas choice was a very smart one i have always appreciated joe bidens directness and i feel he gives nice balance to the ticket obama is smart enough to admit that he doesnt know everything and does have weaknesses and he selected someone who has great knowledge in those areas the presidential ticket is now very well rounded and i believe the election has just been won by the democrats also smart move on the announcement the plan was to build anticipation and they certainly succeeded every news channel was standing by for the announcement had me turning on the news as soon as i woke up to hear it kudos
7138265 the greatest charge against john mccain has been that he has been in washington too long to make a difference in the white house with the addition of sen joe biden the obama campaign can no longer make this charge perhaps the greatest problem with his vice presidential selection is that we all know joe biden and weve written him off after several failed attempts at the presidency all that obama has managed to do with this pick is alert the world that john mccain is right he does have a glaring weakness in foreign policy
7138266 to receive this award is a great honour both for the crew and the festival itself
7138267 program note on coleridge taylor perkinsons sinfonietta no 2 generations
7138268 i heard generations for the first time tonight i thought it was freakin brilliant i loved it thank you coleridge
7138269 hes here five to six days a week working out
7138270 i wont go into any detail regarding what hes doing but ill say this by the first day of training camp hell be ready
7138271 in addition to the strength training program that grover has him on livingston is getting his fill of basketball playing in high level games with approximately 20 25 other nba players including former clipper swingmen corey maggette and quentin richardson
7138272 the next order of business is for livingston to find a team he became an unrestricted free agent last month when the clippers renounced their rights to him prior to that the clippers declined to extend livingston a qualifying offer of at least 5 8 million
7138273 he doesnt have the big wow factor but obamas got the wow factor so its not what he needs he needs somebody safe and biden is safe
7138274 has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7138275 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7138276 this is the one time it matters hell go to the convention and theyll take pictures and then theyll put him on a bus and hes going to drive through nebraska kansas and alabama or wherever theyre going to send him unless he says something off the cuff thats embarrassing it wont be a problem
7138277 very much like lincoln reminding people that politics is messy and theres a gamesmanship to it but that at its core it is meant to reflect the ideals of the people that it represents and that it is participatory that people need to be part of it and so in that sense he and lincoln are on the same page
7138278 we want to win so in the high end space running traditional gaming applications dx opengl etc we will win and when you take advantage of its unique characteristics and some of the more advanced techniques that it will enable it will shine
7138279 game ball goes to scola in a losing effort he was easily the best player on the floor

7138281 vanuit mijn geloofsovertuiging mag het geen jood zijn maar daarmee discrimineer ik niet het zijn gewoon regels punt
7138282 dat choqueerde mij wel zeker van zon intelligente welspraakte marokkaanse dame
7138283 in het nps tv programma raymann is laat deed de rotterdamse pvda deelraadslid hayat benameur mee aan het onderdeel single van de week haar uitspraak over joden in het vraaggesprek met quintis ristie leidde tot negatieve reacties op haar weblog
7138284 dat kan dan niet de man van mijn dromen zijn
7138285 ja inderdaad maar t betekent niet dat je je verstand meteen verliest
7138286 kennelijk is zij opgegroeid in een omgeving met weinig joodse mensen ehm want als dat het geval zou zijn zou ze denk ik zon opmerking niet maken eh want dan zou ze haar eigen vrienden heel erg hebben gekwetst net zoals dat ze mij nu heeft gekwetst
7138287 kijk het is vanuit mijn geloofsovertuiging dat het gewoon niet een joodse man kan zijn en daarmee discrimineer ik niet ja het is gewoon regels van mijn geloof punt
7138288 het meest choquerende van dit filmpje vind ik nog wel dat we hier spreken over een volksvertegenwoordiger een vrouw een dame uit de elite van de marokkaanse gemeenschap heh half marokkaans half algarijns die zon eh eh zeg maar even lage opmerking maakt over joden in nederland of over joden in zn algemeenheid dat is echt choquerend dan heeft ze dus kennelijk een heel verkeerd heel vreemd verwrongen beeld van joden
7138289 zou het kunnen dat je een man tegenkomt waar je tot over je oren verliefd op bent je gaat een paar keer afspreken en je denkt dit is de ware totdat hij verteld ik ben joods
7138290 ja nou kijk dat vind ik heel lastig want ik ben nog nooit in zon positie eh ja beland en tuurlijk probeer je het op een of andere manier wel te voorkomen en eh je probeert het te voorkomen maar zelfs ik kan niet voor mezelf instaan
7138291 disagree with mchale vandermass parkinson or the rest of that goon squad and you end up the target of invective language violently abusive language

7138302 love has been one of the biggest train wrecks in rock music
7138303 away from home you have to make it tough for them then give them problems
7138304 everybody in our side has to be clued up for the type of game it is going to be and we have to look at the lone striker but we have some good attacking players and no system is black and white whether you play 4 4 2 4 3 2 1 4 5 1 or whatever you know home or away you will be playing against international class opposition so youve got to try and get your system right to pick up points
7138305 while its early it looks to us like the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7138306 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7138307 during the boom nine out of 10 houses for sale in many markets were in prime condition now for every 10 houses at least three are dogs
7138308 ive never seen so many houses in this condition before
7138309 and ive been in the business 20 years ive seen bank owned properties in the past they were never like this
7138310 the first one i saw was the worst home i had ever seen in my life
7138311 there were magic marker messages on the front door saying stay out they had poured paint and other stuff on the carpets there was a lot of trash i felt like i was at the scene of a crime i wouldnt let my daughters touch anything
7138312 you find maggots the swimming pools are green the lawns dry up theyre eyesores neighbors yell at us to water the lawn
7138313 all the kitchen appliances cabinets and countertops bathroom fixtures lights are stolen
7138314 they punch holes in the walls dump oil on the carpets the banks are so overwhelmed they havent gotten to the point when they send in crews to fix them up
7138315 a three year old home that recently sold for 660 000 is listed for 350 000 theres no kitchen no master bath the toilet was taken the tub cabinets gone
7138316 once buyers start to feel confident that prices in a given community have stabilized theyll start buying again
7138317 once that inventory is gone well be at the market bottom and the price trajectory will flatten out
7138318 man i have really been working on that and i shouldnt have said that
7138319 what focus features and omissions will pull people away from wow
7138320 i play wow and no game will ever be as good as wow
7138321 we had a conversation we brought him in and he felt if he was given a few more days hed be much better prepared
7138322 he felt the team was playing well without him and it would allow him to get things together which i think is admirable
7138323 the team is playing well and ill take a couple days whatever the decision we made thats what it is
7138324 no they all had these egos where they think they can do anything
7138325 this was a little different situation where the team was playing extremely well
7138326 told us that the kindle is definitely selling very well but they also said the analysts and reporters giving out these extremely high estimates did not run them by company
7138327 i have been tracking the sales of kindle editions of our books against sales of the printed versions for the past almost eight months kindle sales have declined noticeably over the past few weeks while print editions continue to sell at a steady pace
7138328 were sticking by our sources on the estimates of units shipped from the factories in china
7138329 amazon is working on a new version of the kindle and sees a big opportunity to market its e book reader to college students mcadams wright ragen analyst tim bueneman said friday in an e mailed note based on meetings with management
7138330 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7138331 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7138332 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7138333 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7138334 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7138335 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7138336 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7138337 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7138338 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7138339 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7138340 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7138341 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7138342 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7138343 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7138344 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7138345 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history

7138541 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7138542 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7138543 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7138544 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7138545 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7138546 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7138547 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7138548 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7138549 he said the device would have a slide out keyboard a touch screen and two batteries one for the mp3 player one for the phone
7138550 mind you this is the same kevin rose who notoriously claimed that a generation one iphone would launch in both cdma and gsm versions with a pair of batteries and slide out keyboard uh hem this time however he backs up his claims with this picture of a skinnier longer and curvier nano

7138553 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7138554 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7138555 the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7138556 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7138557 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that argues that what you need to do is act more aggressively
7138558 we will have to see where it will go it is too early to give a comment on that
7138559 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7138560 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7138561 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7138562 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7138563 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7138564 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers
7138565 while its early it looks to us like the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7138566 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7138567 it is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head
7138568 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7138569 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7138570 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7138571 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the
7138572 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7138573 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7138574 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and
7138575 service employees international union president andy stern credit for tenacity
7138576 lack of transparency poor employment practices environmental impacts and other indicators of irresponsible corporate behavior
7138577 no private equity firm that we want to do business with will do business with us under these terms
7138578 cost taxpayers and beneficiaries millions in higher taxes and contributions
7138579 destroy our ability to invest in our highest returning asset class
7138580 i told myself if i ever moved back i was going to put on a race up the mount baker highway
7138581 the overall employment figures are still very robust we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7138582 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media
7138583 but when companies are actually adding staff when employments increasing in particular firms you never see that or rarely see that in the media
7138584 i am once again honored to receive this well respected award
7138585 non big ticket proved too controversial and the championed approach ended up dividing the issues into a those being considered in other unfccc bodies b items which would require amendments to the entire kyoto protocol and c rule based items within the groups mandate
7138586 we gave priority to security and to improve administration levels here in kandahar
7138587 we also talked about improvement of the official administration hire capable men for certain departments that they could be able to run the offices with good understanding have mutual understanding with common people
7138588 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7138589 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7138590 as someone from a caucus state when they are run properly they can be a wonderful way for people to come together
7138591 the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelgates were until this year
7138592 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7138593 im going to have a hell of a good time this week
7138594 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a barn in cedar rapids the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis thats because hes still that scrappy kid from scranton
7138595 barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story
7138596 were talking about a career politician for 36 years and so that completely changes the agenda and i can only assume thats because they found out how weak the experience issue was for obama
7138597 i know that joe doesnt back away from a fight
7138598 and if they want to try to swift vote us and throw us some curve balls were ready
7138599 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7138600 its a pretty hard experience hell have to decide which of the seven kitchen tables he has to sit at
7138601 its a very good choice i think im excited about it
7138602 and the thing is youre excited about it the two of them barack obama and joe biden come from urban communities so it could be the first time in a long time you have the two top officials coming from an urban environment
7138603 hes been in the senate for over 30 years so he knows mccain hell be able i believe to do some straight talk about mccain that barack will not be able to do
7138604 biden has a lot of experience he brings a lot to the table i think his being the foreign relations chairman makes it interesting
7138605 it gives us an expansion of our policy for whats going on in the world and i think it develops a little more of a wholeness to the obama biden ticket
7138606 that brings a lot of the northeastern and east coast population and that entire corridor into a more cohesive camp for obama
7138607 it was the best feeling in the world to bring him home
7138608 its amazing to see the kids and with the dad dolls it was pretty cool that before
7138609 did some testing on the networker theme but then rebuilt it from scratch
7138610 if you look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay
7138611 this is an exceptionally brilliant nation at the same time a small nation scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7138612 im absolutely passionate about scotland and i want scotland to do well but im also exceptionally proud of team gbs performance in the olympics i dont see why i should be asked to make a choice between those two
7138613 i was going to wear my sean taylor t shirt
7138614 but my wife told me that the guys here would completely ostracize me and id never get work again i almost brought it anyhow but theyd really give me crap
7138615 ever since carolina was redskins territory hell its still redskins territory just look around

7138617 that really hit home with me i got an 11 month old at home so i figured i could get out and do what i could do
7138618 i found the boy laying there in the grass he was snug as a bug in a rug asleep
7138619 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7138620 currently the recommendations in the uk are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease
7138621 further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the uk
7138622 we just launched a brand new quiz system with the latest build complete with a new look more quizzes to take and custom made user signatures imran
7138623 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7138624 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7138625 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
7138626 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7138627 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7138628 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for
7138629 its better if shes not writing the check directly to me to pay back her brother even though she is
7138630 worthy borrowers used to have lots of options but those have dried up

7138672 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

7138674 in the first half they dominated and we were not strong or quick enough we didnt start well and it is difficult to get back we didnt defend the corner well
7138675 its great to beat one of best teams in the league
7138676 we got the result by playing it was panic stations in the last 15 minutes it was a high tempo game and we were hanging on
7138677 for 70 minutes it was a fairly even game our passing matched the arsenals we doubled up well in the first half
7138678 its very demeaning to be standing here but at the moment we dont have any other way to get food

7138680 i felt the plane judder violently to the left and then right before it went down

7138737 for the best part of three decades policymakers in the developed world followed ronald reagan and margaret thatcher in seeking to roll back the frontiers of the state the triple mantra of privatisation liberalisation and deregulation held sway
7138738 yet the problems that began in credit markets a year ago now cast a cloud over the strong market orientation of western policy after the collapse of banks such as bear stearns in the us and northern rock in the uk and against the current background of mounting speculation about the viability of mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac the anglo american approach to capitalism appears badly flawed
7138739 so is a more intrusive state about to stage a comeback at the free markets expense emulating the governmental response to the economic crisis of the 1930s
7138740 any comparison with the deflationary interwar period stretches the point not least because policymakers in the us and europe know the lessons of that era mindful that pre emptive action can stave off a depression governments and central banks are already responding to the credit crunch and the weakness in housing markets soup queues are not in prospect
7138741 the stage could also be set for politicians to claw back power hitherto devolved to the private sector or to independent agencies of the state
7138742 the biggest conundrum in the post bubble tug of war between government intervention and markets concerns regulation this is according to george soros the high profile hedge fund manager the worst financial crisis since the 1930s yet it would be impossible today to produce banking and securities legislation of the kind lawmakers introduced at that time because financial markets are now global
7138743 their extreme complexity also makes the legislators task a nightmare
7138744 a truly free and competitive market occupies a very delicate middle ground between the absence of rules and the presence of suffocating rules it is because this middle ground is so narrow that capitalism in its best form is very unstable
7138745 the credit bubble was not just a simple market failure but a failure of business leadership corporate governance and risk management exacerbated by flawed incentive structures within banks these too are difficult things for legislation to address and whether the political will exists to throw a vast zareba of controls around the financial system is moot especially given political concern in the us over the international competitiveness of us markets and exchanges

7138758 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7138759 we have federer nadal in tennis lebron james in basketball we have the best cyclists ronaldinho is here in football we want these guys at the games were not saying it should be an entire major league team but we want the top athletes here at the olympics
7138760 i know how to enter the us open and what it takes to win thats a huge advantage i have
7138761 i come here as the defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7138762 i believe it is an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7138763 rafa has never been beyond the fourth round so that is definitely the advantage that i carry
7138764 for five years i was expected to win every tournament
7138765 so now it changes a little bit rafa will feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7138766 maybe it is nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me it should be interesting
7138767 i tried to save a lot of energy at the beginning of the year so i would get through the entire season without a problem
7138768 i had a tough beginning to the season and i have been playing catchup all the way through
7138769 it is just a matter of winning a lot of matches in a row i really feel like this is going to happen at the us open
7138770 ce tournoi pr c de le u s open et cest un tournoi de grande importance jai battu de tr s bonnes joueuses pour d crocher le titre
7138771 je navais pas d nergie surtout dans le troisi me set a confi chakvetadze si vous n tes pas capable de courir et de vous battre sur le terrain alors vous allez perdre le match
7138772 we are halfway through the reporting season and there have been some good results which helping in getting momentum
7138773 the overall market will benefit retailers will gain from increased confidence in the market from oil falling
7138774 the rise in wall street will also send a good signal
7138775 the market could gain 60 or 70 points on monday
7138776 the a team the a team i see the a team
7138777 the fire was well involved by the time we arrived but we managed to extinguish it quickly
7138778 there are a number of high profile cases in which three or four areas of legislation are exposed such as bail and parole decisions that have failed people
7138779 some said we would be skating on thin ice but no one said we would actually be in breach of the act
7138780 to a person using the whole sensorium nudity is the richest possible expression of structural form but to highly visual and lopsided sensibility of industrial societies the sudden confrontation with tactile flesh is heady music indeed
7138781 gewisse erscheinungen sind wenn sie zum ersten mal vorkommen neu
7138782 we will surely try to bring the boats back again
7138783 the goal is to open a route between cyprus and gaza
7138784 people here are just ecstatic to see that someone cares
7138785 proves that your goal is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
7138786 we knew they were looking for a media provocation on the high seas
7138787 so we decided not to let them have the confrontation they wanted
7138788 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7138789 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7138790 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7138791 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7138792 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in
7138793 shes got the physique the music to us at 52 shes an inspiration to go on
7138794 i think shes really good and id like to be like her
7138795 no oh well i suppose i sort of have mmm yes
7138796 a very small politician in stature of place in the world and position
7138797 i cant tell you anymore about it but it was a long long time ago
7138798 he told me he found me a rather difficult job but the truth was i couldnt think of very much to say
7138799 soaking wet because id had to be photographed on a bale of rope on the embankment
7138800 who are these people you promised me they were going to be the losers
7138801 if its a good idea to go on if the going is to be quite so hard
7138802 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7138803 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7138804 the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7138805 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7138806 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that argues that what you need to do is act more aggressively
7138807 we will have to see where it will go it is too early to give a comment on that
7138808 what we want to make sure is that before they jump into solving those problems that they understand the concepts behind them
7138809 otherwise they may just learn how to do a particular problem and then when they hit the next problem they wont know what to do because they didnt understand the basic idea behind the first one
7138810 instead of having somebody lecturing and then having the students try to learn the material based on the lecture and a book and then doing homework exercises and tests based on what theyve put together the idea is to have the students actively engaged in doing physics questions in class
7138811 theres very little lecturing so there might be 15 minutes or half an hour at most a week but most of the time the students are either doing in class activities that we call whiteboards or they are doing a lab
7138812 i wanted to set it quite a long way in the past
7138813 i like to show what happens to people in the past and how it affects their present
7138814 any politician of his sort of level and his sort of ambition
7138815 would know what the media would do to him he doesnt want to be made to look ridiculous you know the three criteria for libel hatred ridicule and contempt people would far rather be despised and hated than made to look ridiculous
7138816 i dont know why i wouldnt come to me they know that somehow its going to get itself into a book people tell me the most extraordinary things ive noticed it for years perhaps they know i wont be shocked or judgemental
7138817 its funny that it happens to have come along at the time of the publication of my book
7138818 ivor and the girl dont beat each other or anything
7138819 the gods are just and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us
7138820 i had a fairly good idea about them i was married to a man who was lobby correspondent in both houses for quite a while i feel great sympathy for politicians
7138821 oh well i suppose i sort of have mmm yes
7138822 no oh no no yeah but im not going to say any more about it
7138823 its something you accept shes a very nice woman phyllis its not necessary with your friends to discuss something you know you will disagree profoundly on people in here get very amused if they see us go and have tea together
7138824 i think im an unusual only child because i didnt want any siblings and ive only got one child myself and didnt want any more
7138825 well i dont think i want to talk about that
7138826 i have always made a lot of friends perhaps because i felt i always needed friends that may be a symptom of my only childness
7138827 i look at things i look up at the roofs which betjeman says people dont do but should
7138828 i love houses when i came down here this afternoon i saw some people moving into a house in hamilton terrace in st johns wood i thought oh i wish i were moving into that house i love moving
7138829 people always tell me my books are so dark i dont think theyre particularly dark im not like that im quite a cheerful soul
7138830 all recorded music has run its course it has all been consumed traded downloaded understood heard before sampled learned revived judged and found wanting dispense with all previous forms of music and music making and start again year zero now
7138831 used to manage echo and the bunnymen was a one hit wonder with the the timelords and
7138832 the worst thing that happened to recorded music in the 20th century
7138833 not to make great music or even totally original music but to make music as if no other music had ever existed before
7138834 if we all accept that britain is the finest place on earth and our record on human rights womens rights and the sheer volume of people seeking asylum here all suggest it is why would you ever go anywhere else
7138835 for this morning i blanched the vegetables together in salted boiling water mixed them with a dash of shoyu pepper and sesame seed oil i bought some

7138862 as long as there is uncertainty over treasurys plan we cant raise money and as long as we cant raise money theres going to be more and more speculation about treasurys plan
7138863 you would have to be insane to invest in these companies right now and weve basically told them that
7138864 when treasury comes in they are guaranteed to get a better deal than us which would push down the value of our investment so why would we ever invest before we know what treasury is going to do

7138900 he has disdain for privilege and for limousine liberals the mark of an honest working class democrat
7138901 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7138902 the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through dangerous waters internationally
7138903 i got elected when i was 29 and i got elected november the 7th and on december 18th of that year my wife and three kids were christmas shopping for a christmas tree a tractor trailer a guy who allegedly and i never pursued it drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch broadsided my family and killed my wife instantly and killed my daughter instantly and hospitalised my two sons with what were thought to be at the time permanent fundamental injuries
7138904 with the current market backdrop the scottish power deal looks pretty attractive
7138905 we are predicting a second wave of hikes to hit in the new year by as much as 25 30
7138906 baa has always been difficult to deal with but that occasion sticks out in my mind even though that decision affected nearly all of heathrows 90 or so airlines it was taken without consultation
7138907 they have put some big question marks over what happens next i think everyone is uncertain as to how it will pan out
7138908 it currently appears to us that the scheme was identified only in november 2005 five years after the building of t5 had started
7138909 that we appear to have been misled over the previous two years
7138910 the vertical circulation of passengers will be external to the building because of the retail space inside
7138911 the scope to spend it all and be remunerated for it with neither the caa nor the airlines having any control
7138912 we will be a lot more responsive to our customers in future
7138913 its not just the competition commission there is a weight of public opinion behind this
7138914 it is unfair to blame ferrovial which led the consortium that bought baa in 2006 for 20 year old problems
7138915 that is the classic position of someone who controls a market
7138916 they have heathrow which is the real jewel and a speedy resolution of this could be best
7138917 there are well advanced plans for both stansted and heathrow i dont think it is possible to execute either of them faster but it is possible to slow them down
7138918 this is a red herring like many of the other arguments against new runways it is distracting us from the difficult decisions that need to be made
7138919 we expect the big decision on a heathrow runway before the end of the year and to interfere with it now on the grounds of promoting capacity seems wrongheaded even if you accept the point about gat wick we are not far away from the end of restrictions on development there in 2019 anyway
7138920 born in leeds moved to london came across a nice guitar wrote a bunch of songs

7138937 normally the majority of our video budget goes towards beer

7138945 herregud heidi du kan ikke ha det s nn rotehue
7138946 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7138947 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be
7138948 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7138949 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7138950 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7138951 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president
7138952 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states
7138953 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7138954 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7138955 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7138956 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7138957 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7138958 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7138959 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7138960 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7138961 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7138962 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7138963 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7138964 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7138965 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7138966 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7138967 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7138968 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7138969 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7138970 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7138971 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7138972 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7138973 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7138974 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7138975 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7138976 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7138977 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7138978 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7138979 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7138980 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7138981 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7138982 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7138983 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7138984 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7138985 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7138986 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7138987 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7138988 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7138989 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7138990 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7138991 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7138992 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7138993 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7138994 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7138995 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7138996 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7138997 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7138998 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7138999 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7139000 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7139001 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7139002 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7139003 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7139004 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7139005 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7139006 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7139007 i am thinking that maybe you had a mild stroke
7139008 hmm enlightenment at last all i needed was a little brain damage
7139009 ramesh ji this stroke thing doesnt seem to be all that bad
7139010 baba ji you are very lucky if we hadnt administered anti clotting agent instantly you probably would not be talking to us and all now the trick will be keeping you from talking too much time to rest
7139011 oh ganesha we have come this far dont let us sink
7139012 we are from berkeley and we would like to have and audience with maharishi
7139013 my father is a professor of physics for the university of california at berkeley and i am a student at that university i practice tm and we have come to see maharishi at the suggestion of dr matts roos
7139014 yes maharishi expecting you coming for several days now come
7139015 good afternoon he said we are glad you could come
7139016 he had a deep voice and spoke with a gentle indian accent with educated british overtones
7139017 i would also like to discuss spreading meditation in the united states especially in the student community i think the time is right
7139018 you should ask him to come in but do you have some private questions
7139019 yes i want to make sure i have the right mantra
7139020 we are searching for new sub atomic high energy particles
7139021 mmm smaller than the smallest and larger than the largest that is the nature of the consciousness you will search and search and then there will be consciousness at the finest level infinite bliss consciousness you have found it yet
7139022 well infinite bliss is your province maharishi i am just an experimentalist looking for very small particles
7139023 your son is doing well he will continue his studies in physics he said looking furtively at my dad
7139024 well maharishi that is up to him i think he is interested in psychology at the moment
7139025 the psychologists just stir up the mud at the bottom of the pond they contribute to suffering not joy no physics is much better
7139026 god is all knowing and we must accept his will
7139027 i would like you to meet james he is becoming a monk and i am please to say that he deeply understands and beautifully teaches my essential prayer
7139028 the course and way of essential prayer is the answer for all your fellow catholics you must stay with father timothy and help make his message a success
7139029 father timothys message is the way but the way to essential prayer is not through the fathers organization
7139030 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7139031 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7139032 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7139033 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7139034 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7139035 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7139036 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7139037 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7139038 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7139039 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7139040 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7139041 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7139042 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7139054 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7139055 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7139056 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7139057 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7139058 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7139059 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

7139102 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him

7139149 the mindless slaughters being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself in the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
7139150 given the sham like nature of the granting of passports in so many cases russias basing its forceful actions on protection of nationals abroad is invalid
7139151 burned these houses to make sure that they the georgians cant come back
7139152 immediately take steps to end ossetian militia attacks on ethnic georgians
7139153 unfortunately putin is putting russia on a course that is ominously similar to stalins and hitlers in the late 1930s swedish foreign minister carl bildt has correctly drawn an analogy between putins justification for dismembering georgia because of the russians in south ossetia to hitlers tactics vis a vis czechoslovakia to free the sudeten deutsch even more ominous is the analogy of what putin is doing vis a vis georgia to what stalin did vis a vis finland subverting by use of force the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbor in effect morally and strategically georgia is the finland of our day
7139154 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat ukraine has to move towards the nato alliance it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability the peace and security of europe are under threat thus a united europe should give a robust and appropriate response

7139181 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7139182 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7139185 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7139186 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7139187 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7139188 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7139189 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7139190 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7139192 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7139193 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7139194 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7139195 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7139196 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7139197 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7139198 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7139199 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7139206 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7139211 people must understand that for every litre of petrol there is already a 30 sen subsidy
7139212 the recent reduction of between eight and 22 sen per litre is actually an additional reduction in fuel prices the people should realise this
7139213 if we translate the rebate to one litre of petrol it is about 35 sen to 40 sen per litre
7139214 if the people are going to continue moaning about it we might as well to do away with the rebate and transfer it rebate to the pump price
7139215 but it would not be fair to people from the lower income group
7139216 if we transfer it the rebate to the pump price then big and expensive cars such as bentley jaguar and the bmw seven series would also benefit from the susbsidy would this be fair
7139217 when it increased further to us 143 per barrel there was no increase
7139218 if you want to make money in life you have to take risks theres no such thing as reward without risk looking backward is no great trick i remain optimistic about the success of this project these are some of the best luxury high rise condos constructed in the city when the storm passes these condos will go at the speed of a missile launch
7139219 we are behind them because they are innocent until proven guilty
7139220 the issue of apologising does not arise as we have enough evidence to charge them we are proud of what we have achieved and are grateful to the media for their cooperation in eradicating corruption
7139221 never mind what people say if i want to change the policy because i think i have to i will change it
7139222 i know there are people who call me a flip flop i do not care
7139223 i have work to do i will do it my way
7139224 i wouldnt have minded waiting if the global crude oil price continued its downward trend
7139225 i have said this before if the trend goes up then there would have been no reduction in the price of petrol and i have been promising that this reduction is possible
7139226 wherever i went everybody was asking the same question when pak lah
7139227 one month is too long pak lah they said so i said never mind we do it
7139228 traders need to pass on the benefits of lower fuel prices to consumers
7139229 please hurry up and reduce the prices help one another
7139230 if i have to do something for the people if i can afford it if there is money available for it then i will do it
7139231 i want to enjoy my life too but where are my privileges as a malaysian citizen
7139232 we need the government to look into our welfare many of us are unfortunate people like myself cannot work due to our physical condition
7139233 so how can we move around if not for public transport
7139234 rapidkl had a brilliant system in the beginning with trunk buses servicing the major routes and local shuttles servicing residential zones but poor enforcement absolutely messed everything up
7139235 every time i take my bicycle out i think i am going to die certain roads do not even have motorcycle lanes how can i move around safely
7139236 in many cases the solutions are incomplete because authorities had not heard the voice of all stakeholders who are the users
7139237 half the problem will be solved if bus lanes serve their purpose
7139238 transit also calls for a central committee to be set up encompassing the major agencies and authorities to look into issues that affect passengers and transport operators
7139239 though the concert could have been scrapped as a result of its timing during the merdeka celebrations this weeks cabinet meeting decided that it could proceed as planned
7139240 how can we cancel a concert when the application had not been submitted
7139241 the promoter galaxy group only submitted its application on aug 11 which meant it could only be reviewed on the 19th at puspals next weekly meeting instead of on aug 12
7139242 if global fuel prices drop further we will have good news on the first day of every month
7139243 otherwise we have to fork out more the mechanism is fair but you must be a smart consumer too for example the price adjustment of ron92 is 22 sen therefore it will be wiser to shift to this variant of petrol than to continue using ron97 which is 15 sen cheaper
7139244 the government is consistent it is not a populist measure if the government wants to be popular we would have reduced it to lower than rm2 55 per litre
7139245 the rhino was obviously injured as it crossed a difficult forest to come out to the flat terrain of the plantation
7139246 it was a delicate operation we had to make sure that the rhino was not too stressed by having humans close to it
7139247 when we first got there the rhino showed signs of aggression and charged at us but we kept our distance and left some fruit and leaves for it
7139248 we also had to make sure that it had enough food and water and was healthy because translocating wildlife can be very stressful for the animal
7139249 we did not have to sedate the rhino as it was easily coaxed into a wooden container and transported by lorry
7139250 we had sedatives but the rhino remained remarkably calm throughout the journey
7139251 in the name of god i have nothing to do with their arrest wallahi wabillahi watallahi i am not behind their arrest by the anti corruption agency
7139252 they pas and nizar may say that this is not the proper way so they can show me how to do it properly and then i will swear as many times as they want no problem
7139253 but i want nizar to swear at the same time date and venue with me if they want me to swear according to their way
7139254 i will swear that i am innocent and he can swear that i am guilty of conspiring against the two exco members him and the state government
7139255 he can swear according to his belief maybe if he is a christian he can swear accordingly or if he wants to do it the chinese way then he can potong ayam slaughter a chicken at a temple
7139256 but if he is going to slaughter the chicken then i want perak mca organising secretary dr mah hang soon state gerakan chief datuk chang ko youn and state ppp chairman datuk lee heng to bear witness to ngehs swearing
7139257 i wish i knew how to start living your dreams
7139258 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7139259 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7139260 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7139261 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo

7139264 harris said she would let state officials know right away if the extra money entered her account because
7139265 he said the device would have a slide out keyboard a touch screen and two batteries one for the mp3 player one for the phone
7139266 mind you this is the same kevin rose who notoriously claimed that a generation one iphone would launch in both cdma and gsm versions with a pair of batteries and slide out keyboard uh hem this time however he backs up his claims with this picture of a skinnier longer and curvier nano
7139267 we leave it to the person concerned if he feels that some injustice has been done to him and he needs to take action then it is up to him
7139268 we did not ask the aca to do what it did perak exco men demand aca and media apologise or face rm100m suit fill up for less lower petrol diesel prices to help poor cope with inflation
7139269 the government made a commitment to the people to reduce oil prices once the global price went down
7139270 the commitment was made even before former permatang pauh mp datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail resigned
7139271 if we reduce the price its because of them but if we dont reduce then the government does not care about the peoples hardship
7139272 pusrawi is not responsible for this but it is an act by irresponsible individual s with vested interest
7139273 its ok dont worry you keep the umbrella its easier this way
7139274 weve trained the children to understand what their father does so they dont disturb him or get upset when hes away from home a great deal
7139275 anwar wont be able to cover every area so i help as much as i can
7139276 hes such a soft hearted person no matter what people do to him he brushes it off he never keeps a grudge
7139277 but thats why the voters like him they like the kind of person he is
7139278 you can see it from the response its very different better than during the general election
7139279 this campaign has been difficult for us there have e been a lot of allegations but when we are in permatang pauh with voters they tell us they dont believe it
7139280 i can sense that people here know anwar and there is a special bond between them
7139281 doch der austausch der heimischen bev lkerung und der optische wandel der st dte sind nicht hinzunehmen
7139282 how do i measure the business results of participating in online social networking
7139283 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7139284 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7139285 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7139286 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7139287 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7139288 milf while shes drinking her ice tea sweetened with equal
7139289 maybe its a canada thing or maybe were just haters or maybe we hate canada
7139290 he was such a decent guy before he got consumed by blind ambition
7139291 john mccain is a dangerously hot headed celebrity pow who cant remember how many houses he owns
7139292 okay so we know hes like the oldest celebrity in the world
7139293 like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
7139294 and we know he was a pow because hes always reminding us every time he says or does something stupid which is like once or twice a day at least
7139295 when they first approached me to do this run my first reaction was youve got to be joking
7139296 but then after speaking to family and friends who had children of their own i started to think it might be something i could do
7139297 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7139298 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7139299 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7139300 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7139301 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7139302 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7139303 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7139304 that little 10 mph wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer

7139315 its going to become more and more apparent to voters that the experience and knowledge needed to be president is not at the top of the democratic ticket
7139316 will rank among the worst presidents if not the worst in the history of our country
7139317 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
7139318 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
7139319 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
7139320 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

7139405 when the deepling first attacked i thought it went for ben because he tripped and was the closest but later it knocked me out of the way ignored celeste and went right for ben picking him up it only really attacked someone else when they got in the way
7139406 yeah and that ghost when he pointed at us and said they have returned it wasnt pointing at us it was pointing at ben warning him
7139407 because last night was the night you turned 14 the same thing happened in 1689 when that ship ran aground
7139408 in 1689 the 14 year old son of lord conway died just like in celestes story twenty six years later the 14 year old son of the next lord died again in 1754 1796 1797 and 1832 the sons of the local lord all died aged 14 i bet if you looked into the records youd find they all died on the night they turned 14
7139409 i still dont get what this has to do with me
7139410 ok here in 1912 melissa seymour conway married a local man trevor ford
7139411 wait my great grandfather was called trevor and my great grandmother was called melissa
7139412 right two years later in 1916 melissas younger brother died aged 14 two years after that her father died probably due to the 1918 flu pandemic her mother never remarried and with her death in 1934 that meant that your great grandmother was the only surviving member of the seymour conway family according to his family tree anyway
7139413 that you benjamin ford are a direct descendent of the family that originally owned this island a family that was cursed for some reason so that all their sons would die if they spent their fourteenth birthday on the island
7139414 its not every day that find out youre descended from nobility and cursed to die a messy death all on the same day
7139415 i dunno my grandfather said that his mum wouldnt let him stay on the island as a kid and made him promise not send my dad to school here when he was a kid maybe this was the reason
7139416 whatever the reason the curse only seemed to affect people when they turned 14 after last night you should be safe
7139417 but ill feel a lot safer when we get back to shore
7139418 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7139419 currently the recommendations in the uk are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease
7139420 further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the uk
7139421 while its early it looks to us like the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7139422 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7139423 the economy has not recovered sufficiently so that withdrawal of the stimulus does look like it will create an air pocket afterwards
7139424 we dont accept sleemans bottles but we will smash them
7139425 no ill take my shot at fortune at the lb thank you
7139426 these are not just efficiency savings but real cuts to the health service totalling more than 85m
7139427 i am very concerned that patient care will suffer as a result
7139428 if nicola sturgeon doesnt want to be branded the minister for health cuts she must make the nhs a genuine priority for the snp and find the money to fund it properly
7139429 this is an absurd and inaccurate attack which rebounds right back to the labour party
7139430 despite the tightest funding settlement since devolution the scottish government increased the budget for our nhs above the projected inflation rate
7139431 and money for cutting waiting times and other priorities is extra to the health board allocations
7139432 a cidade necessita e merece ser ouvida chega desse estilo autorit rio do c sar maia
7139433 i cant discuss the localization issues at this time as for the decision to bring it to the wii i think there were many i think its fair to say that cj wanted to bring one of its premier franchises possibly the premier franchise when you look at the japanese market to the broader audience that the wii represents at least thats one of many variables that pushed it in that direction
7139434 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7139435 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7139436 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7139437 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7139438 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7139439 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7139440 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7139441 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7139442 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7139443 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7139444 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7139445 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7139446 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7139447 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7139448 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7139449 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7139450 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7139451 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7139452 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7139453 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7139454 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7139455 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7139456 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7139457 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7139458 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7139459 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7139460 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7139461 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7139462 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7139463 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7139464 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7139465 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7139466 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7139467 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7139468 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7139469 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7139470 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7139471 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7139472 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7139473 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7139474 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7139475 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7139476 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7139477 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7139478 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7139479 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7139480 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7139481 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7139482 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7139483 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7139484 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7139485 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7139486 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7139487 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7139488 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7139489 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7139490 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7139491 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7139492 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7139493 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7139494 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7139495 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7139496 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7139497 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7139498 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7139499 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7139500 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7139501 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7139502 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7139503 charlie chaplin could do a better job than the labour party at running the home office
7139504 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7139505 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7139506 this is a planning took where all things are going
7139507 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7139508 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7139509 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7139510 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7139511 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7139512 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7139513 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7139514 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7139515 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7139516 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7139517 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7139518 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

7139522 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7139523 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7139524 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7139525 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7139526 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating

7139530 we were pretty disappointed with our record early in the season and we knew we were a lot better team on defence than we had shown
7139531 it was up to us to change that to make no excuses to get out there and do it it was about everyone buying in
7139532 theyve adapted to the conditions very well and it looks as though they have done a lot of work on their defence and come up with some pretty sound tactics they seem a pretty happy side and they want to work for each other the introduction of some young players with self motivation and energy has really helped
7139533 it used to remind me of a holiday station the way it was earlier in the year if they carry on the same way today as they have been doing you will see the markers playing a far more significant role
7139534 one noticeable change is how the players are on the balls of their feet in the defensive line theyve gone from being flat footed and thats nothing but attitude
7139535 we havent worried over the last eight weeks about what others are doing if you did youd be in a bit of trouble
7139536 and now it is up to ourselves we have a little bit of control
7139537 we want to put that myth to bed as we have so many others
7139538 hes one of the biggest wingers in the comp hes showed that when hes on he can tear apart any team some people talk about the fact he drops the ball occasionally but the problem is that when a bloke like him gets his game and confidence up nothing can stop him
7139539 im hoping he has a sound game but hopefully i have a better game than him ive got my hands full this week
7139540 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7139541 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7139542 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7139543 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7139544 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7139545 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7139551 take 2 have admitted that carnival games for the nintendo wii doesnt offer much choice in the way of skin colour but are promising to fix that for the sequel to the game stating that it was a complete oversight
7139552 unfortunately by the time it had gone to manufacturing it was something that couldnt be changed in the original product but when we were developing for the ds it was the first thing that we put in there because we knew we needed a larger variety
7139553 i would be surprised if we dont know what happened fairly quickly
7139554 we knew the risks of launching payloads on a first of a kind rocket
7139555 the applications of hscs are hampered since these cells are difficult to maintain in an undifferentiated state
7139556 i guess we now know who john mccains choice will be as vice president in a guard from his vietnam pow days beating on american soldiers as barack obama has chosen his chief thug whose family has been joyously bashing torturing and terrorizing a gay invalid in lawrence sinclair
7139557 a shift of such magnitude can only happen by developing and implementing breakthrough biomeasurement bioinformatics biologically based and health information technologies that can be integrated with current efforts to improve health care delivery
7139558 before these technologies can be realized and commercialized however a long term economic health care strategy must be established with clear metrics for measuring and determining the value of emerging bio and information technologies
7139559 creating this strategy will facilitate proper allocation of financial resources and ensure a focus on implementing the most promising technologies

7139597 miami dade college doesnt seem to appreciate the important roll midwives play we fill an important need by providing an affordable and accessible health care to at risk communities as a public education institution they have failed this community i am outraged that dr padron wont even address our concerns
7139598 with mdcs program gone the future health care demands of our already under served community cant be met how will midwives be licensed without this accredited program

7139725 the next step is to grow it from 35 000 to 60 000 cases and that will take us to 2012 the third step would be to take us to 150 000 and that would take us past the 10m mark

7139791 imelda to file p500 b suit vs marcos cronies we own practically everything
7139792 we practically own everything in the philippines from electricity telecommunications airlines banking beer and tobacco newspaper publishing television stations shipping oil and mining hotels and beach resorts down to coconut milling small farms real estate and insurance
7139793 they were paid well supported and allowed to live the lives of the rich and famous and look what weve got a betrayal they were tapped by ferdinand supposedly to guard his interests in those companies but look what happened they wanted everything
7139794 that lucio tan hes nothing just somebody who used to buy used bottles
7139795 we will take back everything that the trustees cronies held on behalf of ferdinand marcos including those that they sold and surrendered to the government whoever bought any of the marcos companies or assets will have to face us in court
7139796 lucio tan bought pal using money from fortune tobacco and allied bank both of which are majority owned by the marcoses
7139797 i wont be president of any company because im already the president of the country
7139798 we love her dearly but sometimes she goes wild and crazy and its very exciting to watch
7139799 there is no more honor among thieves theyre now all dirty quarrelling thieves and i hope they kill themselves fighting over the loot
7139800 now that imelda marcos has revealed their not so hidden wealth the government has enough basis for an investigation covering not only the plunder which the marcos family committed but also to include the murders abductions and torture they ordered
7139801 we should not let the opportunity pass there is an element of truth to the delusion filled statements of imelda marcos in fact when imelda talks like a crazy woman she is just being herself and these are the rare moments when she tells the truth we just have to sift through her statements and arrive at a goldmine literally and figuratively when the hawaii federal district court ordered the marcos family to indemnify the victims of human rights violations imelda claimed that she was poor and now that she has an attack of her imeldific disease she claims that they own almost all strategic corporations in the philippines everybody knows this but the marcos family had denied it in the past to start with she can be investigated for illegal trading of gold second they can be investigated on the source of the ill gotten wealth thereby strengthening the graft charges against them and equally if not more important they should be held criminally liable for the murders abductions and torture that they ordered against the 10 000 victims of the marcos fascist dictatorship
7139802 why on earth should anyone give immunity to imelda marcos
7139803 this effectively ensconced the marcoses beyond the reach of the law and sets a dangerous precedent for public accountability it is a virtual warrant for public officials to amass public funds illegally since there is an open option to compromise their liability in exchange for only a portion of their ill gotten wealth
7139804 why would we compromise with either the government or the victims if we can get the entire assets and properties back through winning legal battles
7139805 if we fall short of our projects in our agriculture we will use it the money is there why shouldnt we use it we will just borrow it anyway
7139806 class counsel have pursued the litigation with unrelenting vigor for almost 13 years including four years of collection efforts collection of the judgment or any significant part thereof through judicial execution proceedings is unlikely and would take years of continued litigation in various countries at substantial cost class counsel believes that virtually all class members would welcome a distribution at this time which would make a difference in the quality of their lives
7139807 in return for the payment the class and its members give up the right to continue executing on the judgment vacate the injunction and contempt citation and related fines dissolve the judicial assignment and agree to release the estate the marcos family and the republic of the philippines from any civil claims for human rights abuses occurring between 1972 and 1986
7139808 ndfp holds estrada responsible for betraying victims of human rights violations
7139809 they were riddled with bullets during encounters with military forces water cured electrocuted and submarined drowned until their last breath some of them were buried alive most women were sexually maligned before being killed there were also some who just vanished into thin air all of them have fallen into the night
7139810 it was not just any ordinary loyalty the kind that exists between really close friends it was a fanatical type of loyalty in the classic master servant relationship a throwback to the feudal history of the ilocos it was something akin to fierce sicilian loyalty ver was the quintessential marcos loyalist he was ready to die for marcos
7139811 as the military pays its respects to one of the persons who played a key role in the plunder and oppression of the country during the marcos dictatorship friends and relatives of victims of human rights violations will honor the true martyrs of the land those who offered their lives to fight for genuine freedom and democracy
7139812 death may have extinguished general vers legal liabilities but it will never absolve him of the widespread and blatant atrocities committed during the marcos dictatorship
7139813 following military tradition breeds more military monsters who believe they will be honored in death despite their abusive records it creates a feeling of impunity
7139814 what weve found with places like stephens lake and other areas is that if you develop a very healthy native aquatic shoreline it helps the water quality immensely
7139815 three years ago i treated stephens lake four or five times last year i only had to treat it three times and this year ive only had to treat it once
7139816 and that is largely due to the fact that the shoreline is developing a really healthy diverse shoreline of aquatic plants
7139817 the reduction in treatments is not only a decrease in cost to the city because the chemicals are expensive but its also a big savings in time
7139818 but any time we can improve the water quality through natural means its always beneficial we strive to reach a good equilibrium
7139819 i probably had 15 to 20 volunteers each day thats incredible for our staff alone to do this youre talking about a couple weeks of work
7139820 now we have our own plants to harvest it really helps our budget
7139821 anytime you give someone valuable work to do with visible results its a great thing people are happy out there
7139822 thats our goal not only that they understand what were doing but that they can take this to their own property
7139823 and you dont have to do things this elaborate a small rain garden or a rain barrel off a gutter is great too
7139824 this is yet another example of moronic use of privacy concerns
7139825 if the technology is as safe as they claim then all the technical specifications should be published and people should be informed when they are being tracked
7139826 it would not take much adjustment to make this system a ubiquitous surveillance infrastructure over which we have no control

7139832 as for market power replacing oil is easy nuclear use up all the old plutonium from the bombs first then the uranium then thorium that should buy us a couple of hundred years in which to perfect solar fusion for those industries that must have fossil fuels eg aviation make it from coal
7139833 a number of influential people in russia china india indonesia and vietnam say the planet is now entering a 30 year cooling period the second half of a normal cycle driven by cyclical changes in the suns output and currents in the pacific ocean their theory leaves true believers in carbon catastrophe livid to judge by actions not words the carbon warming view hasnt come close to persuading a political majority even in nations considered far more environmentally enlightened than china and india europes coal consumption is rising not falling and the continent wont come close to meeting the kyoto targets for carbon reduction australia is selling coal to all comers
7139834 have they any formal models to support their cooling claims
7139835 from that graph if i had to bet id say the decadal trend is currently negative
7139836 the trend for the past ten years is positive but not statistically significant so im going to simply assert that its negative
7139837 from that graph if i had to bet id say the decadal trend is currently negative
7139838 weve seen a decade of gradual cooling not just month to month variation
7139839 but a gradual weakening should begin soon if the center remains over land

7139860 plants are part of the natural world that we are born into

7139869 it would be a pretty brave government who would take a victim to court
7139870 it would be the best promotion we could ever get people are irate about this act they want the freedom to have their voice heard

7139965 we were pretty disappointed with our record early in the season and we knew we were a lot better team on defence than we had shown
7139966 it was up to us to change that to make no excuses to get out there and do it it was about everyone buying in
7139967 theyve adapted to the conditions very well and it looks as though they have done a lot of work on their defence and come up with some pretty sound tactics they seem a pretty happy side and they want to work for each other the introduction of some young players with self motivation and energy has really helped
7139968 it used to remind me of a holiday station the way it was earlier in the year if they carry on the same way today as they have been doing you will see the markers playing a far more significant role
7139969 one noticeable change is how the players are on the balls of their feet in the defensive line theyve gone from being flat footed and thats nothing but attitude
7139970 we havent worried over the last eight weeks about what others are doing if you did youd be in a bit of trouble
