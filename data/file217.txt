2170130 untuk memahami teks bahasa arab dengan mana al qur an diturunkan diperlukan pengetahuan tentang sejumlah keadaan
2170131 untuk menafsirkan al qur an diperlukan pemahaman atas tradisi adat istiadat masyarakat arab dalam berbahasa bertingkahlaku dan berinteraksi ketika teks teks al qur an diturunkan
2170132 untuk dapat memahami maksud teks diperlukan pengetahuan makna bahasa yang sengaja dibuat dan digunakan dalam pergaulan masyarakat hal ini bisa dilakukan dengan memahami teks itu sendiri atau dengan merujuk pada teks teks lain yang identik pemahaman atas teks juga bisa dengan menggunakan nalar rasional ihalah ala dalil al aql dan melalui indikasi indikasi pada sejumlah konteks isyarat isyarat simbol simbol rumuz perubahan perubahan harakat konteks sosial yang mendahuluinya al sawabiq dan yang sesudahnya lawahiq serta hal hal lain yang tidak terbatas

2170147 the problem of delayed justice continues even now the whole aim of fast justice in the childrens court is far from achieved the whole process is time consuming and it is a torture for the child who is expected to come after two years before the court and recollect everything and depose
2170148 till now the victim have not been called for deposition nor have the witnesses statement taken by the court witnesses are going to the court only to get a new date for deposition
2170149 but what i am more concerned about is the court ambience which is yet not sensitive enough or child friendly
2170150 attention also needs to be given to the provisions in the goa childrens act requiring a capacity development strategy for the training of judiciary so that they can be abreast with the developments in the child rights law nationally and internationally

2170154 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2170155 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2170156 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2170157 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2170158 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2170159 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2170160 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2170161 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2170162 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2170163 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2170164 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2170165 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2170166 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2170167 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2170168 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2170169 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2170170 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2170171 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2170172 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2170173 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2170174 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2170175 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2170176 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2170177 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2170178 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2170179 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2170180 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2170181 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2170182 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2170183 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2170184 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2170185 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2170186 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2170187 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2170188 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2170189 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2170190 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2170191 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2170192 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2170193 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2170194 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2170195 allahs heaven and hell are also in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2170196 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2170197 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2170198 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2170199 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2170200 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2170201 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2170202 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2170203 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2170204 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2170205 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2170206 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2170207 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2170208 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2170209 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2170210 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2170211 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2170212 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2170213 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2170214 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2170215 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2170216 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2170217 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2170218 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2170219 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2170220 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2170221 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2170222 oh allah you used to keep me hungry and naked like your friends but i do not know the reason that how i have got such a great position similar to your friends
2170223 i will advice you to become the king of this world and other world after death so you should become ascetic in the world and do not
2170224 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2170225 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be
2170226 do you know that who are you and i have bought your mother in 200 dirhams
2170227 one who know allah then he should get lost himself permanently in the condition of surprise that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2170228 which action will deliverance for the money we get and for this money we should see that it is coming from halal right source and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2170229 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the
2170230 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things all things depend upon two things first not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2170231 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2170232 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2170233 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2170234 due to his thinking his are visible on his body
2170235 inspite of this condition one pious person who was on his journey for the hajj came to his house in baghdad and at that time he was sleeping when he woke up and told came into his dream and conveyed his message that he should not over look his duties towards her mother which is better than performing the hajj
2170236 he saw her two eyes and was fallen in her love
2170237 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of
2170238 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2170239 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2170240 i have desire for pity on me on the day of judgement which is good for always the some days so if i face the difficulties of this world is better than the difficulties of the day of judgement
2170241 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2170242 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2170243 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i told him that many persons
2170244 his name is ghulam jabbar slave of jabbar so he is walking proudly and at the same time he became un conscious and fallen on the ground when they approached him to see
2170245 once in his student life he saw a beautiful boy with long his name is noman and his fathers name is thabit his position is very high in the mystic knowledge
2170246 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2170247 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2170248 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2170249 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2170250 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2170251 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2170252 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2170253 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2170254 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2170255 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2170256 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2170257 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2170258 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2170259 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2170260 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2170261 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2170262 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2170263 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2170264 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2170265 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2170266 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2170267 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2170268 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2170269 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2170270 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2170271 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2170272 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2170273 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2170274 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2170275 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2170276 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2170277 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2170278 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2170279 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2170280 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2170281 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2170282 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2170283 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2170284 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2170285 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2170286 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2170287 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2170288 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2170289 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2170290 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2170291 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2170292 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2170293 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2170294 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2170295 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2170296 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he
2170297 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2170298 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2170299 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2170300 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2170301 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2170302 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2170303 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2170304 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2170305 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2170306 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2170307 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2170308 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2170309 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2170310 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2170311 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2170312 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2170313 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2170314 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2170315 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2170316 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need
2170317 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2170318 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2170319 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2170320 he thought caliph a bad man but he never told this to the people in this matter so that people may not think me sincere and truthful and for this i will leave this world in insincere condition
2170321 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2170322 allah will reward you for giving me advice since many years
2170323 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep away us from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2170324 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and
2170325 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2170326 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2170327 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2170328 if a man busy himself in the worship then angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2170329 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2170330 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say
2170331 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2170332 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy so tell him to put the hand on place of pain
2170333 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2170334 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who
2170335 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2170336 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah after that he reached the house
2170337 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2170338 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2170339 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2170340 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2170341 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2170342 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2170343 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2170344 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2170345 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2170346 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2170347 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2170348 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2170349 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2170350 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2170351 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2170352 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2170353 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time
2170354 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2170355 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2170356 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today then the old man took me to his house and presented egg and bread when i was reluctant to eat the above food then i heard a divine call in which it
2170357 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2170358 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2170359 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2170360 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2170361 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval in any condition what ever he likes
2170362 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2170363 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2170364 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2170365 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2170366 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2170367 asking for more will cause difficulties to think sole as better will create proud
2170368 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2170369 he should not be angry with any body for the sake of matters of the world
2170370 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2170371 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that
2170372 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2170373 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2170374 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2170375 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2170376 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers
2170377 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is
2170378 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless
2170379 the best desire is that which will solve our problems
2170380 those who leave the sins and then they can hope from allah for his grace but others who the sins so they will have fear that allah will forgive them or not so such hope is false in which one who continuously commits the sins and seek forgiveness of allah the wrong doers have more fear than hope from allah true persons know the nature of all things he more important than others so for this thing leave every thing and then you allah so that you can see all others standing in need of you
2170381 we have created jinn and human beings for my worship
2170382 to sacrifice the and if you can not do this then leave to act upon the sayings of the mystic persons
2170383 he was regret to know that you had sold away your religion for the value of two particles of gold because at the time purchasing some thing from some body you told him the price five times less to the salesman which the owner of the shop told you and due to your status of dignity the salesman believed your statement and sold away the thing at the lesser price
2170384 to learn quran for worldly gains is not useful and it is
2170385 you are a slave so for the slave there will be no comfort
2170386 you got your punishment of your thought and if you thought more than this then you will get more punishment than this
2170387 as you looked other than us so we had taken back your dress of pious persons if then we will also take back your
2170388 here i find the recitation of quran and the worship style which is not as per my standard
2170389 i know well that you did not stolen my donkey but i
2170390 i do not blame you for this act and this is not from you and i think allah will not commit mistakes so i do not complain you
2170391 then the boy due to the fear of allah died suddenly
2170392 the shortage of wealth is useful in the both worlds and its increase is harmful in the both worlds
2170393 the best indigent person is one from whom the kings could not ask the back biting and bad talking
2170394 abu ali you always think for yourself and you did not think for others
2170395 we had sent the tiger for you so by holding the tigers legs you should come out of the well
2170396 due to this miracle he accepted the religion of islam and he
2170397 oh free man what do you want and he relied you are strange pious person who are looking other than
2170398 due to the respect of allah i never stretched my legs in the loneliness he gained knowledge from abdallah
2170399 one of our beloved person has asked you to bring some sweet but you ignore his request
2170400 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2170401 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2170402 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2170403 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2170404 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2170405 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave
2170406 why not every guy should buy their girlfriend a wii
2170407 these guidelines will benefit the patients in reducing the complications related to blood pressure such as vascular cardiac renal and eye complications these organs are often affected due to high blood pressure
2170408 an average indians salt intake per day is quite high because of our dietary habit of eating processed foods and salt containing foods such as pickles papads chips chutneys and preparations containing baking powder
2170409 my principal sister monica coelho has said that if i pass standard xii then i will be recruited at the pre primary school level as a teacher i will work under her guidance for three years
2170410 she didnt know how to take care of herself but today she is independent
2170411 the person whom i love the most is sister monica she is very nice just like a mother
2170412 when we play in asia we play to asian people and when we plan in south america we play to south american people but when we play in africa we play to european people following which they played
2170413 we love touring the most fucked up countries in the world and their most fucked up cities and johannesburg is definitely one of the most fucked places weve ever been to we played in australia once that was awesome you guys should go there except youve got some good cocaine here
2170414 when i got fired i felt my life fall apart woody was my idol and here he was telling people i acted retarded actually i was playing my character as if she was drunk but like most people who get fired i didnt get the chance to discuss the matter with my boss
2170415 enough friends and strangers related to my dismissal mostly by telling me tales of their own firings that i got the idea for the book everyone it seems who has been in any kind of workplace has been fired or knows someone who has
2170416 its as if they know either the person who fired them will be reading or seeing them tell their story or they want others to know you can have a great career despite being fired
2170417 the hardest part i had was stopping the flow of material were putting dvd extras together which are longer than the film itself because i had so many great stories that i wanted to share many of the people that i interviewed actually said they deserved to be fired theres a lot of humility in these stories
2170418 actors get fired all the time the truth is i was probably miscast in the role creative differences in my mind are just another way of saying you sucked
2170419 a worker in orlando said that when she was fired she was told she was being promoted to a customer someone else was fired with the words were freeing you up for your future nobody in show business ever is honestly told why theyre being fired
2170420 theyre told its because of creative differences as if that covers any excuse for saying we dont want you any more people prefer to be told the truth even if it hurts their feelings
2170421 if i saw woody again id tell him that im glad he didnt kill me which is what happens to an actress jennifer tilly plays in his film

2170431 the suffering and mental breakdown of the tortured detainees is traded against the wellbeing of middle america they must stay there in order topreserve the peace and prosperity of the citizenry security has become americas daily vitamin supplement
2170432 alone survives this wholesale obsolescence as a symbolic token over which essentially political struggles still help us to differentiate left and right thus utopian has come to be a code word on the left for socialism or communism while on the right it has become synonymous with totalitarianism or in effect with stalinism
2170433 the state an apex form in which the power of men is organized both among men and over women while purporting institutionalized peace and justice has been revealed as an institution of male dominance
2170434 a discussion in which reasons are advanced for and against some proposition or proposal
2170435 to achieve management control over local operation s but not have legal consequences due to local issues
2170436 it is easier to define domination oppression and torture if ones victims are imagined as inferior less human or merely objects who exist to serve subjects subordination oppression and subjectification undermine the very possibility of subjectivity address ability and response ability are what i identify with the process of witnessing subjectivity is the result of the process of witnessing the need to demand recognition from the dominant culture or group is a symptom of the pathology of oppression oppression creates the need and demand for recognition

2170443 im sorry i cant believe what ive done and almost done please i love you
2170444 god please if i am saved please let the rain stop falling into this puddle im looking at
2170445 you can get a large audience together for a strip tease act that is to watch a girl undress on the stage now suppose you came to a country where you could fill a theatre by simply bringing a covered plate on the stage and then slowly lifting the cover so as to let every one see just before the light went out that it contained a mutton chop or a bit of bacon wouldnt you think that in that country something had gone wrong with the appetite for food and wouldnt anyone who had grown up in a different world think there was something equally queer about the state of the sex instinct among us
2170446 while i cannot prevent the birds from flying over my head i can prevent them from making a nest in my hair
2170447 i made a covenant with my eyes not to look with lust upon a girl
2170448 i have thought much about your words and stored them in my heart so that they would hold me back from sin
2170449 if you value the approval of god fix your minds on the things which are holy and right and pure and beautiful and good
2170450 i have found that becoming a deeply committed christian does not keep one from being fully aware of beauty in the opposite sex and i do not think this recognition is in any sense sin or is an indication that one needs a spiritual check up in fact if you do not recognize physical beauty in the opposite sex and if you are my age you may need a physical check up and i am very serious recognition in my opinion is never sin as a matter of fact recognition of specific possibility for sinning is a prerequisite for the development of christian character for instance a blind man would not be considered honest for not stealing gold on a table before him only a man who saw the gold and recognized fully his drive for it but chose not to steal it it is what one does with that which is recognized that causes the problems
2170451 lord do not let me face temptation in this realm that i cannot overcome
2170452 trojans all of my life i have lived by a code and the code is simple honor the gods love your woman and defend your country troy is mother to us all fight for her
2170453 go home prince of trouble it is to early in the day for killing princes
2170454 bird signs u want to plan a strategy based on bird signs
2170455 every last one of us has a kingdom or a queendom or a government a realm that is uniquely our own where our choice determines what happens we are made to have dominion within an appropriate domain of reality this is the core of the likeness and the image of god in us and is the basis of the destiny for which we were formed our kingdom is simply the range of our effective will
2170456 now gods own kingdom or rule is the range of his effective will where what he wants done is done the person of god himself and the action of his will are the organizing principles of his kingdom but everything that obeys those principles whether by nature or by choice is within his kingdom
2170457 it existed from the moment of creation and will never end ps 145 13 dan 7 14 it can not be shaken hebr 12 27 and is totally good it has never been in trouble and never will be it is not something that human beings produce or ultimately can hinder we do have an invitation to be part of it but if we refuse we only hurt ourselves
2170458 accordingly the kingdom of god is not essentially a social or political reality at all indeed the social and political realm along with the individual heart is the only place in all of creation where the kingdom of god or his effective will is currently permitted to be absent that realm is the on earth of the lords prayer that is opposed to the in heaven where gods will is simply done
2170459 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh on account of sin he condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit
2170460 in him we live and move and have our being
2170461 come to me all who labour and are heavily laden and i will give you rest
2170462 seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
2170463 my idea of village swaraj is that it is a complete republic independent of its neighbours for its wants and yet interdependent for many others in which dependence is a necessity
2170464 our panchayat has become too politicized to function effectively in our interest we need to restore to it its true responsibility as a body to oversee the development of the village and villagers it shouldnt act as a branch office of the government in power nor the village cell of the constituencys mla
2170465 the sincerity of our panch members will be gauged by the alacrity with which they carry out the proposals in the peoples plan the gram sabha and all villagers of chandor cavorim expect the panchayat to immediately start working out the cost of implementing the proposals outlined here
2170466 after all the development and prosperity of our village is the responsibility of all chandorcars
2170467 sartre argues that 1 theres no god or meaning in life so 2 one can assert any meaning or no meaning as one pleases

2170472 but the limits of the poem are human and here in the world things are the poet says absolutely hopeless young people do not realize this because theyre not yet fully aware that they will die and not only they themselves will die but their whole civilization everything they love and believe in will die and sooner than they dream
2170473 there are basically two choices either you behave as if there were a god and try to determine whats right in other words you make up values you dream up a future better than the present and try to create it or else you accept the world as it seems to be
2170474 young people do not realize this because theyre not yet fully aware that they will die and not only that all
2170475 if there isnt a reachable god and if life has no inherent meaning how should one live on
2170476 there are basically two choices either you behave as if there were a god and try to determine whats right in other words you make up values you dream up a future better than the present and try to create it or else you accept the world as it seems to be and scoff at all values dreams for the future

2170478 he explores ever avenue of the question and he leaves the reader free
2170479 like murder the boy thought the flashlights made it happen dumb and dangerous and as a result his friends kiowa was dead
2170480 maybe he would just take a couple of practice swings and knock the ball down the the middle and pick up his clubs and walk off into the afternoon
2170481 ashit field you got to admit its pure world class irony
2170482 the best you can hope for is fame and the poet undercuts even that in many many ways starting with the poems first line which means literally
2170483 in my grendel the dragon presents the long range point of view everything will eventually die so you might as well go for short term gratification
2170484 in other words one of the main things beowulf is about is how in this world you simply cannot win no matter how noble you are
2170485 but the limits of poem are human and here in the world things are the poet says absolutely hopeless
2170486 its true that a good writer is indeed a careful philospher
2170487 in other words one of the main things beowulf is about is how in this world you simply cannot win no matter how noble you are
2170488 lo we have found out by search the glory of the speardanes
2170489 everything will eventually die so you might as well go for short term gratification seek out gold and sit on it

2170499 physically sick isolated paranoid vulnerable and no longer able to sleep in the bedroom
2170500 far from the beast who has been depicted by the complainants he is extremely vulnerable from time to time suicidal almost permanently tearful and thoroughly inadequate
2170501 because of his inadequacy he needs to emphasise his sexuality at all times to those he deals with
2170502 the shame disgust and lasting unease will persist in some of those young women for the rest of their lives
2170503 this was a prolonged and detailed investigation that mixed hi tech investigation techniques with traditional police work
2170504 through the hard work and dedication of the investigating officers and with the co operation and courage of victims and witnesses what began as a straight forward burglary inquiry rapidly expanded into a major investigation into numerous sexual offences against multiple victims across several years
2170505 we are very pleased that we were able to bring together all the evidence in such a way that batchelor had no choice but to admit to 14 offences many of them extremely serious
2170506 though the investigation was complex and convoluted at times one thing to come out of it is crystal clear anthony batchelor was and remains a sexual predator and a danger to the public
2170507 we are pleased that the sentence handed out today means that he is where he should be behind bars and likely to stay there for a considerable period of time

2170510 the mayor is keen to improve the oyster card to make it even more attractive for londoners and tfl will work to make sure this happens both quickly and in a way that represents the best value
2170511 transport for london is committed to delivering value for money across all of its services as part of this we are looking at more cost effective ways to manage and develop the oyster card system that we expect will save millions over the next few years
2170512 the savings will be reinvested to deliver further improvements in londons transport system
2170513 as with the majority of pfis private finance initiatives the prestige contract which has been in existence since 1998 and includes oyster incorporates a 10 year break clause element
2170514 the london transport system has changed dramatically over the past 10 years for the benefit of all stakeholders contract negotiations have been taking place over the last year between transys and tfl the transys consortium will continue to operate and deliver for the next two years

2170550 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
2170551 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2170552 the use of some cbrn materials has the potential to have very serious and widespread consequences
2170553 an example would be the use if a nuclear device
2170554 there is no historical precedent for this type of terrorist attack
2170555 this should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2170556 the government is collaborating actively with international partners on prevention detection and research and is taking every practical step to ensure that the uk is prepared to limit the internal spread of a pandemic and to minimise health economic and social harm as far as possible
2170557 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things
2170558 a thing like the flu pandemic its very difficult to gauge exactly what the scale of it will be
2170559 we have done a great deal of work on it and i hope when people read this they will be reassured by the amount of work that we have done within government
2170560 we have been urging the government to be more open about the risks the uk faces for some time
2170561 however the real value of it will depend on how good the information supporting it is and if the government actually deals with the threats it highlights
2170562 for example while the resilience of supply chains is crucial we compare extremely poorly with comparable advanced economies when it comes to stockpiling oil and gas resources to sustain us through an emergency
2170563 on cyber crime a lords select committee has condemned the governments head in the sand approach
2170564 in the next few months we will publish a national security green paper
2170565 this green paper will set out an effective national security strategy dealing among other things with the resilience of the uk to withstand emergencies
2170566 for the generation which arrives at the gate in the 1960s felt to be the establishment and the enemy dead stifling canonical the reified monuments one has to destroy to do anything new this means that there will be as many different forms of postmodernism as there were high modernisms in place
2170567 one of the most significant features or practices in postmodernism today is pastiche pastiche is like parody the imitation of a peculiar or unique style the wearing of a stylistic mask speech in a dead language but it is a neutral practice of such mimicry without parodys ulterior motive without the satirical impulse without laughter without that still latent feeling that there exists something normal compared to which what is being imitated is rather comic pastiche is blank parody parody that has lost its sense of humor

2170579 dan yang mempersatukan hati mereka orang orang yang beriman walaupun kamu membelajakan semua kekayaan yang berada dibumi niscaya kamu tidak dapat mempersatukan hati mereka akan tetapi allah telah mempersatukan hati mereka sesungguhnya dia maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
2170580 yang saya maksud dengan ukhuwah adalah terikatnya hati dan ruhani dengan ikatan aqidah aqidah adalah sekokoh kokoh ikatan dan semulia mulianya ukhuwah adalah saudaranya keimanan sedangkan perpecahan adalah saudara kembarnya kekufuran
2170581 maka apakah mereka tidak merenungkan al quran ataukah hati mereka telah terkunci
2170582 siapapun yang mencari saudara tanpa salah dan cela maka ia tidak akan menemukan saudara
2170583 tidak sempurna keimanan seorang mukmin hingga ia mencintai saudaranya seperti ia mencintai dirinya
2170584 diantara ciri kebaikan keislaman seseorang adalah meninggalkan yang sia sia
2170585 dan barang siapa yang meminta kesyahidan dengan penuh kejujuran maka allah akan menyampaikanya walaun ia meninggal diatas tempat tidurnya
2170586 ya allah sesungguhnya engkau maha mengetahui bahwa hati hati ini telah bersatu berkumpul untuk mencurahkan mahabbah hanya kepadamu bertemu untuk taat kepada mu bersatu dalam rangka menyeru dijalan mu dan berjanji setia untuk membela syariat mu maka kuatkanlah ikatan pertaliannya ya allah abadikanlah kasih sayangnya tunjukkanlah jalannya dan penuhilah dengan cahay mu yang tidak pernah redup lapangkanlah dadanya dengan limpahan iman dan keindahan tawakkal kepada mu hidupkanlah dengan dan matikanlah dalam keadaan syahid di jalan mu sesungguhnya engkau sebaik baik pelindung dan sebaik baik penolong
2170587 tidaklah suatu kaum berkumpul di salah satu rumah rumah allah untuk melantunkan ayat ayat suci al quran dan mempelajarinya melainkan akan turun kepada mereka ketenangan dilingkupi pada diri mereka rahmat dilingkari para malaikat dan allah pun akan menyebut memuji mereka pada makhluk yang ada di dekat nya
2170588 sesungguhnya allah tidak mengubah keadaan sesuatu kaum sehinga mereka mengubah keadaan yang ada pada jiwa mereka sendiri
2170589 dan kami turunkan dari alquran suatu yang menjadi obat dan rahmat bagi orang orang yang beriman dan alquran itu tidaklah menambah kepada orang orang zalim selain kerugian
2170590 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dan berimanlah kepada rasul nya niscaya allah memberikan rahmat nya kepadamu dua bagian dan menjadikan untukmu cahaya yang dengan cahaya itu kamu dapat berjalan dan dia mengampuni kamu dan allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang

2170611 this is overdue recognition that this neighbourhood needs this scheme and shows a landmark shift away from the dogma of percentages and towards delivering the homes and community facilities that individual neighbourhoods really need
2170612 this area already has high levels of social housing fifty one per cent of local homes are for social rent it is sandwhiched between two large estates white city and wormholt estates which have more than 1 800 homes for social rent between them
2170613 white city is amongst the most deprived neighbourhoods not just in the borough but in the country one in three adults in the area have no educational qualifications at all and over 50 per cent of ward residents are on housing benefit
2170614 this scheme will provide white city residents with a badly needed foot on the home ownership ladder and produce a more mixed and balanced community
2170615 a census of all council tenants in 2007 identified that 72 per cent of people living in council housing would like to own their own homes if they could afford it
2170616 this development helps make their aspirations a reality by providing 70 homes for low cost sale and it delivers a badly needed health centre and other vital neighbourhood improvements
2170617 the people of white city have been waiting for a new health centre for many years now they will have a first class centre offering top rate care and they deserve to reap the fantastic benefits that it will bring
2170618 our message today is simple dont bury your head in the sand the right help at the right time can make the difference between losing your home and keeping it
2170619 being in debt can bring misery to a lot of people but losing your home on top would be harder still that is why i am so pleased to see the norwich scheme stops people from sliding deeper into debt
2170620 the scheme reaches out to people who may simply have felt overwhelmed by the rent arrears enabling them to talk to the rent office about any problems they are having with the help of an independent mediator
2170621 the norwich scheme is exactly is an example of people getting together to solve a problem without going to court
2170622 some people are genuinely fearful of dealing with their affairs and sometimes lack the life skills and confidence to do so
2170623 this scheme enables us to help many particularly vulnerable people avoid losing their homes and all the trauma that entails particularly when there are children involved
2170624 the scheme also helps people avoid increasing their debt through having to pay court fees many of our clients have said that without our support they would have lost their property
2170625 we are delighted that this scheme has been so successful and we are looking at how we can build on that success in the future our aim is to work effectively in partnership with our tenants to achieve positive outcomes

2170630 chinatown will be adapting to the challenges of the 21st century using the best of both chinese and british craftsmanship to ensure the area retains its distinctive mix of both traditions
2170631 the traditional buildings and street pattern of this part of georgian london have adapted incredibly throughout the last century to accommodate the emerging chinese life and culture and now plans are underway to make it even more vibrant
2170632 we are working towards the goal of making londons chinatown the best in the world and although it clearly has its own distinct identity these plans will help to make it become more authentic
2170633 these would form part of the next exciting phase for chinatown following the multi million pound programme of improvements already carried out in the area
2170634 i have been overwhelmed by the knitty noras determination to help at the hospital
2170635 we hope to continue working with them and with genesis community to raise enough money to buy some important equipment for some of our older patients in the psychiatric ward
2170636 it is wonderful to see our knitted items help such good causes
2170637 the knitty noras will continue knitting to raise money for older patients on the psychiatric ward and are also planning some fundraising events in the autumn to help sponsor a new bench for the hospital
2170638 genesis community is committed to creating opportunities that make a real difference to its residents and their communities these community champions make a wonderful contribution to their community also knitting together rather than on their own we are delighted to support projects like this
2170639 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2170640 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
2170641 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2170642 this was a deliberate attack requiring a long chase with revenge in mind
2170643 this was really arrogant group violence and the result is totally unacceptable
2170644 it was an attack carried out without any regard to the standards and rules that we live by and no thought for the victim his friends and his family
2170645 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone on before and no mercy was shown
2170646 i have little doubt that you are a wilful individual you are prone to anger you have shown a tendency to use violence when it suits you
2170647 immaturity coupled with a misguided sense of principality and loyalty
2170648 martin was a charming loving boy who has left us with cherished memories that will remain with us forever
2170649 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken
2170650 we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin
2170651 it was extremely sad to be burying martin at the tender age of 14
2170652 we thank god for the strength that he has given us throughout this whole unimaginable experience
2170653 then i saw what seemed to be a stabbing motion rather than a punching motion four or five times in very rapid succession
2170654 martin probably did not know when he began running away that he was running for his life pursued for such a distance by these defendants on cycles and mopeds
2170655 allah berfirman apabila hamba ku senang untuk bertemu dengan ku aku juga senang untuk bertemu dengannya dan jika dia tidak suka untuk bertemu dengan ku aku juga tidak suka untuk bertemu dengannya

2170657 bukan itu yang aku maksud melainkan orang mukmin ketika dijemput oleh kematian ia mendapatkan kabar gembira bahwa ia memperoleh ridha dan karamah allah maka tidak ada sesuatu yang lebih ia sukai daripada apa yang ada di hadapannya sehingga ia amat senang untuk bertemu dengan allah allah pun senang untuk bertemu dengannya adapun orang kafir ketika dijemput oleh kematian maka ia mendapatkan kabar gembira bahwa ia akan mendapatkan azab dan siksa allah maka tidak sesuatu yang paling ia benci daripada apa yang ada di hadapannya sehingga ia tidak senang untuk bertemu dengan allah allah pun tidak senang untuk bertemu dengannya
2170658 barangsiapa senang untuk bertemu dengan allah maka allah juga senang untuk bertemu dengannya dan barangsiapa tidak senang untuk bertemu dengan allah maka allah juga tidak senang untuk bertemu dengannya
2170659 barangsiapa senang untuk bertemu dengan allah niscaya allah juga senang untuk bertemu dengannya dan barangsiapa tidak senang untuk bertemu dengan allah niscaya allah juga tidak senang untuk bertemu dengannya kematian itu datang sebelum seseorang bertemu allah
2170660 barangsiapa senang untuk bertemu dengan allah maka allah juga senang untuk bertemu dengannya dan barangsiapa benci untuk bertemu dengan allah maka allah juga benci untuk bertemu dengannya
2170661 wahai nabi allah apakah yang dimaksud dengan benci untuk bertemu dengan allah adalah membenci kematian setiap kita membenci kematian
2170662 bukan seperti itu melainkan orang mukmin ketika mendapatkan kabar gembira bahwa ia memperoleh rahmat ridha dan surga allah maka ia senang untuk bertemu dengan allah alah pun senang untuk bertemu dengannya adapun orang kafir ketika mendapatkan kabar gembira bahwa ia akan mendapatkan azab dan murka allah maka ia benci untuk bertemu dengan allah allah pun benci untuk bertemu dengannya
2170663 allah swt berfirman apabila hamba ku senang untuk bertemu dengan ku aku pun senang untuk bertemu dengannya dan jika dia tidak suka untuk bertemu dengan ku aku pun tidak suka untuk bertemu dengannya

2170686 the trial of a taylorsville police officer charged over a year ago with misdemeanor negligent homicide has been put on hold while the defense requests an interlocutory appeal
2170687 the statute is supposed to give police officers some limited immunity or privileges but it requests the presence of all those factors that are delineated in the statute so it has no effect
2170688 any police officer that engages in a chase does so at his or her own risk
2170689 corbett has no way to predict the standard of care expected of him in an emergency vehicle pursuit
2170690 conform with the rule established by the department of public safety
2170691 do the flaws in trial courts constitutional analysis leave corbett and other officers at unfair risk of criminal and civil liability and leave the public at risk of the dangers of non uniform standards governing high speed chases and other emergency vehicle operations
2170692 has failed to fulfill its duty of drafting clear legislation but instead has delegated that duty to the department of public safety
2170693 the fact that there are no minimum rules enacted by the department of public safety is a ripe and ongoing problem which must be remedied by the courts otherwise officers and other emergency vehicle operators like corbett will be engaging in high speed chases and other emergency vehicle operations without any uniform safety standards to protect the public and without exemption laws aimed at protecting emergency responders

2170710 we aim to keep increases in council tax below inflation levels for the next four years it may not seem dramatic or exciting but it is very good news for pensioners and anyone else on a fixed income we have raised nearly 500 000 a year through managing our assets better and have saved a further 400 000 by working more efficiently doing the right thing means hard work not soundbites

2170753 kepada ku telah diberikan segala kuasa di sorga dan di bumi karena itu pergilah jadikanlah semua bangsa murid ku dan baptislah mereka dalam nama bapa dan anak dan roh kudus dan ajarlah mereka melakukan segala sesuatu yang telah kuperintahkan kepadamu dan ketahuilah aku menyertai kamu senantiasa sampai kepada akhir zaman

2170761 kita tidak usah malu malu bahwa terdapat berbagai kekhilafan di dalam alkitab kekhilafan kekhilafan tentang angka angka perhitungan tahun dan fakta

2170763 jadi benarlah daud itu pengarang mazmur yang 73 jumlahnya hal itu belum tentu sudah beberapa kali kita suci menjumpai gejala bahasa orang israel suka menggolongkan karangan karangan di bawah nama orang yang termasyhur oleh karena itu tentu tidak mustahil pengumpulan pengumpulan mazmur mazmur itu atau orang orang yang hidup lebih kemudian memakai nama daud karena raja itu termasyhur sebagai pengarang mazmur mazmur dengan kata lain perkataan pemakaian nama daud musa salomo itu merupakan tradisi kuno yang patut diperhatikan tetapi tradisi itu tidak mengikat

2170771 christmas was not among the earliest festivals of the church it was not instituted by christ or the apostles or by bible authority it was picked up of afterward from paganism
2170772 christmas it was according to many authorities not celebrated in the first centuries of the christian church as the christian usage in general was to celebrate the death of remarkable persons rather than their birth
2170773 a feast was established in memory of this event christs birth in the fourth century in the fifth century the western church ordered it to be celebrated forever on the day of the old roman feast of the birth of sol as no certain knowledge of the day of christs birth existed

2170776 it was an ancient custom among jews of those days to send out their sheep to the field and desert about the passover early spring and bring them home at commencement of the first rain
2170777 adalah kebiasaan lama bagi orang orang yahudi untuk menggiring domba domba mereka ke padang menjelang paskah yang jatuh awal musim semi dan membawanya pulang pada permulaan hujan pertama
2170778 during the time they were out the sepherds watch them night and day as the first rain began early in the month of marchesvan which answers to part of our october and november begins sometime in october we find that the sheep were kept out in the open country during the whole summer and as these sepherds had not yet brought home their flocks it is a presumptive argument that october had not yet commenced and that consequently our lord was not born on the 25th of december when no flock were out in the fields nor could he have been born later than september as the flocks were still in the fields by night on this very ground the nativity in december should be given up the feeding of the flocks by night in the fields is a chronological fact see the quotation from the talmudists in lightfoot
2170779 selama domba domba berada di luar para penggembala mengawasinya siang dan malam
2170780 how much the date of the festival depended upon the pagan brumalia dec 25 following the saturnalia dec 17 24 and celebrating the shortest day of the year and the new sun can not be accurately determined the pagan saturnalia and brumalia were too deeply entrenched in popular custom to be set aside by christian influence the pagan festival with its riot and merrymaking was so popular that christians were glad of an excuse to continue its celebration with little change in spirit and in manner christian preachers of the west and the near east protested against the unseemly frivolity with which christs birthday was celebrated while christians of mesopotamia accused their western brethren of idolatry and sun worship for adopting as christian this pagan festival
2170781 certain latins as early as 354 may have transferred the birthday from january 6th to december which was then a mithraic feas or birthday of the unconquered sun the syrians and armenians who clung to january 6th accused the romans of sun worship and idolatry contending that the feast of december 25th had been invented by disciples of cerinthus
2170782 katakan dengan lantang dan jangan menghiraukan penghinaan mereka kumandangkan suaramu seperti terompet dan tunjukkan di depan umatku tentang kesesatan mereka
2170783 the holly the mistletoe the yule log are relics of pre christian times
2170784 rangkaian bunga holly pohon mistletoe dan batang pohon yule yang dipakai sebagai penghias malam natal adalah warisan dari zaman sebelum kristen
2170785 the use of christmas wreath is believed by authorities to be traceable to the pagan customs of decorating buildings and places of worship at the feast which took place at the same time as christmas the christmas tree is from egypt and its origin date from a period long anterior to the christian era
2170786 hiasan yang dipakai pada upacara natal adalah warisan dari adat agama penyembah berhala paganisme yang menghiasi rumah dan tempat peribadatan mereka yang waktunya bertepatan dengan malam natal sekarang sedangkan pohon natal berasal dari kebiasaan mesir kuno yang masanya lama sekali sebelum lahirnya agama kristen
2170787 janganlah menjadi saksi palsu dan ada cara yang menurut manusia betul tetapi sebenarnya itu adalah ke jalan kematian dan kesesatan
2170788 hal itu tidak usah mengherankan sebab iblis pun menyamar sebagai malaikat terang jadi itu bukanlah hal yang ganjil jika pelayan pelayannya menyamar sebagai pelayan pelayan kebenaran kesudahan mereka akan setimpal dengan perbuatan mereka
2170789 janganlah biasakan dirimu dengan tingkah langkah bangsa bangsa janganlah gentar terhadap tanda tanda di langit sekalipun bangsa bangsa gentar terhadapnya sebab yang disegani bangsa bangsa adalah kesia siaan
2170790 bukankah berhala itu pohon yang ditebang orang dari hutan yang dikerjakan dengan pahat oleh tangan tukang kayu orang memperindahnya dengan emas dan perak orang memperkuatnya dengan paku dan palu supaya jangan goyang
2170791 pohon itu tidak bisa berbicara dan orang harus mengangkatnya karena ia tidak bisa berjalan sendiri
2170792 janganlah takut kepadanya sebab ia tidak dapat berbuat jahat juga tidak dapat berbuat baik
2170793 bukankah bibel alkitab telah menceritakan kepada kita untuk ditiru lupakah kita kisah 3 orang dari timur yang datang ke betelhem untuk memberikan hadiah ketika yesus lahir
2170794 the interchange of presents between friends is alike characteristic of christmas and the saturnalia and must have been adopted by christians from the pagan as the admonition of tertullian plainly shows
2170795 tukar menukar hadiah antar teman di hari natal serupa dengan adat agama saturnalia kemungkinan besar kebiasaan ini diadopsi oleh orang orang kristen dari agama pagan sebagaimana yang dilakukan oleh orang orang tertulianus
2170796 sesudah yesus dilahirkan di betlehem di tanah yudea pada zaman raja herodes datanglah orang orang majus dari timur ke yerusalem dan bertanya tanya
2170797 di betlehem di tanah yudea karena demikianlah ada tertulis dalam kitab nabi dan engkau betlehem tanah yudea engkau sekali kali bukanlah yang terkecil di antara mereka yang memerintah yudea karena daripadamulah akan bangkit seorang pemimpin yang akan menggembalakan umatku israel
2170798 pergi dan selidikilah dengan seksama hal hal mengenai anak itu dan segera sesudah kamu menemukan dia kabarkanlah kepadaku supaya aku pun datang menyembah dia
2170799 verse 11 they presented unto him gifts the people of the east never approach the presence of kings and great personages without a present in their hands the custom is often noticed in the old testament and still prevails in the east and in some of the newly discored south sea islands
2170800 ayat 11 mereka memberi hadiah kepadanya adalah kebiasaan orang orang timur apabila menghadap raja atau orang orang terkemuka mereka selalu membawa hadiah kebiasaan seperti ini juga tercantum dalam kitab perjanjian lama dan masih berlaku di timur juga dapat ditemuka di south sea islands kepulauan laut selatan
2170801 walaupun kita tidak mengetahui secara tepat hari kelahiran yesus apa salahnya kita memilih hari untuk merayakan ulang tahunnya
2170802 sinners alone not saints celebrate their birthday hanya orang kafir bukan orang orang suci yang merayakan hari ulang tahun mereka
2170803 walaupun natal itu kebiasaan orang orang kafir pagan yang menyembah dewa matahari tetapi kita tidak menyembah dewa tersebut melainkan untuk menghormati yesus kristus
2170804 maka hati hatilah supaya jangan engkau kena jerat dan mengikuti mereka setelah mereka dipunahkan dari hadapanmu dan supaya jangan engkau menanya nanya tentang tuhan mereka dengan berkata
2170805 allah itu roh dan barang siapa yang menyembah dia harus menyembahnya dalam roh dan kebenaran sebab bapa menghendaki penyembah penyembah demikian
2170806 percuma mereka beribadah kepadaku sedangkan ajaran yang mereja ajarkan ialah perintah manusia
2170807 sungguh kamu telah menolak ajaran tuhan tetapi kamu mengikuti ajaran tradisimu sendiri
2170808 pergilah kamu hai umatku pergilah dari padanya supaya kamu jangan mengambil bagian dalam dosa dosanya dan supaya kamu jangan turut ditimpa malapetaka malapetakanya
2170809 created man out of a mere clot of congealed blood
2170810 we created man from sounding clay from mud moulded into shape 15 26

2171006 dan menjual kecantikanmu menjadi kekejian dengan meregangkan kedua pahamu bagi setiap orang yang lewat sehingga persundalanmu bertambah tambah
2171007 engkau bersundal juga dengan orang asyur oleh karena engkau belum merasa puas ya engkau bersundal dengan mereka tetapi masih belum puas
2171008 engkau yang memberi hadiah 1 umpan kepada semua yang mecintai engkau sebagai bujukan supaya mereka dari sekitarmu datang kepadamu untuk bersundal
2171009 sosok tubuhmu seumpama pohon korma dan buah dada gugusannya aku ingin memanjat pohon korma itu dan memegang gugusan gugusannya kiranya buah dadamu seperti gugusan anggur

2171012 kita tidak usah malu malu bahwa terdapat berbagai kekhilafan di dalam alkitab kekhilafan kekhilafan tentang angka angka perhitungan tahun dan fakta
2171013 dalam naskah aslinya tentu tidak terdapat kesalahan kesalahan tetapi kekhilafan itu barulah kemudian terjadi di dalam turunan naskah itu isi alkitab juga dalam bentuknya yang asli telah datang kepada kita dengan perantaraan manusia
2171014 jadi benarlah daud itu pengarang mazmur yang 73 jumlahnya hal itu belum tentu sudah beberapa kali kita suci menjumpai gejala bahasa orang israel suka menggolongkan karangan karangan di bawah nama orang yang termasyhur oleh karena itu tentu tidak mustahil pengumpulan pengumpulan mazmur mazmur itu atau orang orang yang hidup lebih kemudian memakai nama daud karena raja itu termasyhur sebagai pengarang mazmur mazmur dengan kata lain perkataan pemakaian nama daud musa salomo itu merupakan tradisi kuno yang patut diperhatikan tetapi tradisi itu tidak mengikat
2171015 susunan semesta alam diuraikan dalam kitab kejadian i tidak dapat dibenarkan lagi oleh ilmu pengetahuan modern
2171016 pandangan kejadian i dan seluruh alkitab tentang susunan semesta alam adalah berdasarkan ilmu kosmografi bangsa babel pandangan itu sudah ketinggalan jaman
2171017 dengan pandangan bahwa kitab suci hanya catatan saja dari orang maka diakui juga bahwa di dalam kitab suci mungkin sekali ada kesalahan oleh karena itu kitab suci mungkin sekali ada kesalahan oleh karena itu kitab suci denganbentuk sekarang masih dapat diperbaiki
2171018 di dalam perjanjian baru pun ada kitab kitab yang diragukan antara lain surat wahyu dan yakobus yang disebut surat jeram
2171019 in the scriptures no one is recorded to have kept a feast or held a great banquet on his birthday it is only sinners like paraoh and herod who make great rejoicings over the day in which they were born into this world
2171020 christmas was not among the earliest festivals of the church it was not instituted by christ or the apostles or by bible authority it was picked up of afterward from paganism
2171021 christmas it was according to many authorities not celebrated in the first centuries of the christian church as the christian usage in general was to celebrate the death of remarkable persons rather than their birth
2171022 a feast was established in memory of this event christs birth in the fourth century in the fifth century the western church ordered it to be celebrated forever on the day of the old roman feast of the birth of sol as no certain knowledge of the day of christs birth existed
2171023 di daerah itu ada gembala gembala yang tinggal di padang menjaga kawanan ternak mereka pada waktu malam
2171024 jangan takut sebab sesungguhnya aku memberitakan kepadamu kesukaan besar untuk seluruh bangsa hari ini telah lahir bagimu juruselamat yaitu kristus di kota daud
2171025 it was an ancient custom among jews of those days to send out their sheep to the field and desert about the passover early spring and bring them home at commencement of the first rain
2171026 adalah kebiasaan lama bagi orang orang yahudi untuk menggiring domba domba mereka ke padang menjelang paskah yang jatuh awal musim semi dan membawanya pulang pada permulaan hujan pertama
2171027 during the time they were out the sepherds watch them night and day as the first rain began early in the month of marchesvan which answers to part of our october and november begins sometime in october we find that the sheep were kept out in the open country during the whole summer and as these sepherds had not yet brought home their flocks it is a presumptive argument that october had not yet commenced and that consequently our lord was not born on the 25th of december when no flock were out in the fields nor could he have been born later than september as the flocks were still in the fields by night on this very ground the nativity in december should be given up the feeding of the flocks by night in the fields is a chronological fact see the quotation from the talmudists in lightfoot
2171028 selama domba domba berada di luar para penggembala mengawasinya siang dan malam
2171029 how much the date of the festival depended upon the pagan brumalia dec 25 following the saturnalia dec 17 24 and celebrating the shortest day of the year and the new sun can not be accurately determined the pagan saturnalia and brumalia were too deeply entrenched in popular custom to be set aside by christian influence the pagan festival with its riot and merrymaking was so popular that christians were glad of an excuse to continue its celebration with little change in spirit and in manner christian preachers of the west and the near east protested against the unseemly frivolity with which christs birthday was celebrated while christians of mesopotamia accused their western brethren of idolatry and sun worship for adopting as christian this pagan festival
2171030 certain latins as early as 354 may have transferred the birthday from january 6th to december which was then a mithraic feas or birthday of the unconquered sun the syrians and armenians who clung to january 6th accused the romans of sun worship and idolatry contending that the feast of december 25th had been invented by disciples of cerinthus
2171031 katakan dengan lantang dan jangan menghiraukan penghinaan mereka kumandangkan suaramu seperti terompet dan tunjukkan di depan umatku tentang kesesatan mereka
2171032 the holly the mistletoe the yule log are relics of pre christian times
2171033 rangkaian bunga holly pohon mistletoe dan batang pohon yule yang dipakai sebagai penghias malam natal adalah warisan dari zaman sebelum kristen
2171034 the use of christmas wreath is believed by authorities to be traceable to the pagan customs of decorating buildings and places of worship at the feast which took place at the same time as christmas the christmas tree is from egypt and its origin date from a period long anterior to the christian era
2171035 hiasan yang dipakai pada upacara natal adalah warisan dari adat agama penyembah berhala paganisme yang menghiasi rumah dan tempat peribadatan mereka yang waktunya bertepatan dengan malam natal sekarang sedangkan pohon natal berasal dari kebiasaan mesir kuno yang masanya lama sekali sebelum lahirnya agama kristen
2171036 janganlah menjadi saksi palsu dan ada cara yang menurut manusia betul tetapi sebenarnya itu adalah ke jalan kematian dan kesesatan
2171037 hal itu tidak usah mengherankan sebab iblis pun menyamar sebagai malaikat terang jadi itu bukanlah hal yang ganjil jika pelayan pelayannya menyamar sebagai pelayan pelayan kebenaran kesudahan mereka akan setimpal dengan perbuatan mereka
2171038 janganlah biasakan dirimu dengan tingkah langkah bangsa bangsa janganlah gentar terhadap tanda tanda di langit sekalipun bangsa bangsa gentar terhadapnya sebab yang disegani bangsa bangsa adalah kesia siaan
2171039 bukankah berhala itu pohon yang ditebang orang dari hutan yang dikerjakan dengan pahat oleh tangan tukang kayu orang memperindahnya dengan emas dan perak orang memperkuatnya dengan paku dan palu supaya jangan goyang
2171040 pohon itu tidak bisa berbicara dan orang harus mengangkatnya karena ia tidak bisa berjalan sendiri
2171041 janganlah takut kepadanya sebab ia tidak dapat berbuat jahat juga tidak dapat berbuat baik
2171042 bukankah bibel alkitab telah menceritakan kepada kita untuk ditiru lupakah kita kisah 3 orang dari timur yang datang ke betelhem untuk memberikan hadiah ketika yesus lahir
2171043 the interchange of presents between friends is alike characteristic of christmas and the saturnalia and must have been adopted by christians from the pagan as the admonition of tertullian plainly shows
2171044 tukar menukar hadiah antar teman di hari natal serupa dengan adat agama saturnalia kemungkinan besar kebiasaan ini diadopsi oleh orang orang kristen dari agama pagan sebagaimana yang dilakukan oleh orang orang tertulianus
2171045 sesudah yesus dilahirkan di betlehem di tanah yudea pada zaman raja herodes datanglah orang orang majus dari timur ke yerusalem dan bertanya tanya
2171046 di betlehem di tanah yudea karena demikianlah ada tertulis dalam kitab nabi dan engkau betlehem tanah yudea engkau sekali kali bukanlah yang terkecil di antara mereka yang memerintah yudea karena daripadamulah akan bangkit seorang pemimpin yang akan menggembalakan umatku israel
2171047 pergi dan selidikilah dengan seksama hal hal mengenai anak itu dan segera sesudah kamu menemukan dia kabarkanlah kepadaku supaya aku pun datang menyembah dia
2171048 verse 11 they presented unto him gifts the people of the east never approach the presence of kings and great personages without a present in their hands the custom is often noticed in the old testament and still prevails in the east and in some of the newly discored south sea islands
2171049 ayat 11 mereka memberi hadiah kepadanya adalah kebiasaan orang orang timur apabila menghadap raja atau orang orang terkemuka mereka selalu membawa hadiah kebiasaan seperti ini juga tercantum dalam kitab perjanjian lama dan masih berlaku di timur juga dapat ditemuka di south sea islands kepulauan laut selatan
2171050 walaupun kita tidak mengetahui secara tepat hari kelahiran yesus apa salahnya kita memilih hari untuk merayakan ulang tahunnya
2171051 sinners alone not saints celebrate their birthday hanya orang kafir bukan orang orang suci yang merayakan hari ulang tahun mereka
2171052 walaupun natal itu kebiasaan orang orang kafir pagan yang menyembah dewa matahari tetapi kita tidak menyembah dewa tersebut melainkan untuk menghormati yesus kristus
2171053 maka hati hatilah supaya jangan engkau kena jerat dan mengikuti mereka setelah mereka dipunahkan dari hadapanmu dan supaya jangan engkau menanya nanya tentang tuhan mereka dengan berkata
2171054 allah itu roh dan barang siapa yang menyembah dia harus menyembahnya dalam roh dan kebenaran sebab bapa menghendaki penyembah penyembah demikian
2171055 percuma mereka beribadah kepadaku sedangkan ajaran yang mereja ajarkan ialah perintah manusia
2171056 sungguh kamu telah menolak ajaran tuhan tetapi kamu mengikuti ajaran tradisimu sendiri
2171057 pergilah kamu hai umatku pergilah dari padanya supaya kamu jangan mengambil bagian dalam dosa dosanya dan supaya kamu jangan turut ditimpa malapetaka malapetakanya
2171058 gak usah mencari kesalahan karena kesalahan itu pasti ada kesempurnaan itu hanya milik tuhan allah bantahan saya diatas hanya untuk menyadarkan anda agama cuma buatan manusia untuk pedoman supaya kehidupan manusia itu tidak menyimpang jauh dari kodratnya
2171059 agama islam tidak mengajarkan kasih namun mengajarkan kebencian dan ketakutan

2171065 negara berpenduduk mayoritas islam lebih berakhlak mulia daripada negara berpenduduk mayoritas hindu
2171066 negara berpenduduk mayoritas islam lebih berakhlak mulia daripada negara berpenduduk mayoritas kristen

2171068 memangnya kalo wikipedia bisa diedit berarti isinya pasti salah si jelasenggak aja tuh yg ngeles mulu
2171069 rasain loe makanya jangan pake pakaian minim ngundang berahi tau akibatnya sekarang loe
2171070 urusan puasa kan urusan diri sendiri ke tuh n kenapa fpi mengatasnamakan islam agama untuk memaksa pemilik warung untuk menghormati orang yang puasa tidak dewasa dalam beriman kepada agamanya sendiri
2171071 semua itu berpulang ke pengendalian diri sendiri diri sendiri harus yang lebih di utamakan bukan pengendalian orang lain diri sendiri adalah pokok pembicaraan disini
2171072 setelah dikasih tau supaya jangan pake pakaian minim tapi masih aja pake pakaian minim
2171073 islam tidak memikirkan anggapan pihak lain dalam kegiatannya melakukan kebenaran
2171074 emang loe sebagai kakak tau apakah adik mau ke tempat yang bener atau ke tempat yang ngga bener
2171075 tapi one way or another kakak harus tetap melarang adik memakai baju seksi terlepas adik mau kemana karena seperti gw udah pernah jelasin sebelumnya kakak tidak mau mengambil risiko sesuatu yg jelek tejadi pada adiknya sepanjang perjalanan ke dr dan di mall itu sendiri kan masih ada kemungkinan hal yg tidak baik terjadi
2171076 kakak tidak mau mengambil risiko sesuatu yg jelek tejadi pada adiknya sepanjang perjalanan ke dr dan di mall itu sendiri kan masih ada kemungkinan hal yg tidak baik terjadi
2171077 emang seorang muslim pria tau hati seorang cewe yang sedang pake pakaian minim bahwa dia si cewe sengaja berpakaian begitu buat menarik lawan jenis berahi lawan jenis bukannya karena alasan lain
2171078 btw emang larangan untuk memakai baju minim di dalam islam ada parameternya yaa nitt misal islam melarang wanita memakai baju minim kalau islam tau apa yang ada di benak si wanita adalah untuk pergi ke tempat ngga bener ahh anehh
2171079 fpi tanpa tau alasan yang jelas secara membabi buta membongkar warung makan padahal warung makan buka bukan untuk menghina orang puasa tapi untuk sekedar menyambung hidup orang keluar rumah pake celana minim bisa aja karena celana panjang dan jlbab lagi dicuci semua
2171080 dalam pencegahan yang gw paparkan diatas agar kita melakukan dengan cara yang benar bila ada yg melakukan dengan cara yg tidak benar kekerasan fpi maka dia akan mempertanggungjawabkannya kelak jadi jangan pernah berpikir bahwa fpi mewakili hukum islam meskpun mereka pakai atribut islam coba tanya sama quraish shihab atau arifin ilham atau abu sangkan ulama2 yang memang telah mendapat pengakuan karena ilmu agamanya apakah mereka akan membenarkan tindakan kekerasan tersebut
2171081 melarang kan ngga harus dengan kekasaran pls jgn mulai kasih contoh orang2 yang kasar sama perempuan dgn mengatasnamakan hukum islam negara islam bukan cuman afghanistan era taliban loh sampe sekarang juga afghanistan masih pake hukum islam loh begitu juga iran mesir arabsaudi brunei darussalam uni emirat arab dll
2171082 jadi begini karena saya punya uang banyak maka saya belikan narkoba dan mabuk2an terus kenapa punya uang banyak nggak diharamkan kan bisa mencegah kejahatan juga
2171083 in case loe ga nangkep maksud gw bilang negara islam bukan cuman afghanistan era taliban maksud gw negara iran mesir arabsaudi brunei darussalam uni emirat arab ngga memukuli kaki perempuan dgn sepotong kayu kecil melakukan kekerasan seperti loe dan gw sering liat di tv tv pada negara afghanistan era taliban padahal negara2 tersebut memberlakukan hukum islam
2171084 ah bingung gw mungkin gw bacanya harus berkali2 yaa biar nyambung dan meminjam istilahnya howard stern
2171085 jadi jangan pernah berpikir bahwa fpi mewakili hukum islam meskpun mereka pakai atribut islam
2171086 ooooooo itu toh maksud loe gue kira kita sedang membahas boleh atau tidak kita melarang wanita yang berpakaian minim tanpa tau alasan sang wanita berpakaian spt itu hmmmm kayanya contoh2 gw di posting di atas mengarah ke bahasan itu deh tapi coba gw minta tolong orang lain buat mastiin
2171087 apa sih hukuman buat wanita yang berpakaian minim di negara2 selain afganistan era taliban tsb
2171088 islam itu ajaran yang melarang orang melakukan hal yang ngga baik contoh 1 melarang wanita berpakaian minim 2 melarang pembakaran gereja 3 melarang pembunuhan masal 4 melarang pemboman gedung dll
2171089 pohon bisa memberi nutrisi yang jelek ke buah sehingga buah berfikir dan menentukan tindakannya sendiri itu berdasarkan bimbingan dari pohon
2171090 jadi analoginya ajaran islam itu pohon dan muslim itu buah
2171091 jadi alegorinya ajaran islam itu pohon dan muslim itu buah
2171092 semacam ini adalah lumrah dilakukan oleh masyarakat arab pada zaman itu
2171093 rasulullah meniggal dunia di rumahku pada giliranku berada dalam rengkuhan dadaku bahwa allah menyatukan antara ludahku dan ludah beliau saat wafat
2171094 meninggal dalam rengkuhan dadaku saat meninggal dan allah menyatukan ludahku dan luda beliau
2171095 mengapa kamu memikirkan hal hal yang jahat di dalam hatimu manakah lebih mudah mengatakan dosamu sudah diampuni atau mengatakan bangunlah dan berjalanlah tetapi supaya kamu tahu bahwa di dunia ini anak manusia berkuasa mengampuni dosa

2171118 since 1984 when my obsession with cheese began ive had recipes in my head but never found the right time or person to make the cheese until last year when i met my neighbour alex james
2171119 his boundless curiosity excellent palate and fascination for cheese blew me away and in his column in the observer the following week he dubbed cheese
2171120 everyone is talking about my cheese and i dont have one what can i do
2171121 this years great british cheese festival will be a great opportunity to showcase the wallops and i cant wait
2171122 there is certainly a buzz about the olympic games and having mark around has definitely heightened the excitement he brings the games to life for the estates young people and has also proved a talking point among the parents
2171123 its my way of giving something back and i am enjoying it the kids here seem great and i really hope i can teach them some of what i have learnt being back in walsall is also good as this is home i do get back regularly and am glad of that
2171124 mark is very pleased with the level of discipline the kids display and is enjoying working with them and sharing his skills and experience i am delighted that he has joined the kabs team and shown a keen interest in the community of beechdale
2171125 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2171126 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head
2171127 make a real difference in ensuring that repossession is only ever used as a last resort
2171128 whilst the rate of repossessions is not on the same scale as the early 90s we want to ensure that the right support is in place for those who might need it now because of global economic pressures
2171129 current elevated inflation levels and risks mean that the bank of england is unlikely to provide any help to financially stretched individuals by cutting interest rates any time soon
2171130 indeed there is still a genuine possibility that the bank of england could even raise interest rates which would be an alarming prospect for a number of households
2171131 the relatively low level of repossession activity does not justify complacency on the housing market
2171132 to help breathe fresh life into both the residential market and the economy we believe there is a strong case for a stamp duty holiday allied to more fundamental reform of the planning process to enable housebuilders to respond more rapidly when demand for new stock re emerges
2171133 o que lle de a gana o alcalde e o seu grupo do psoe
2171134 life has changed for me i have lost weight feel weak and easily tired
2171135 i got medicines for a week later when i went to the clinic i was insulted and denied medicines because there was no doctor or nurse on duty this went on for more than a week and my condition deteriorated and i had to be hospitalised
2171136 i am going to the std clinic because i get medicines free of cost
2171137 at present there is no doctor at the baina std clinic we are trying to cover up for it with the help of auxiliary workers and they are doing good work but there is an obvious lack of doctor which shows
2171138 it is really difficult times for us each time i have fought to rebuild my life now i am tired
2171139 if they had tb it would have been very difficult for them to access dot services and even more difficult for services and ngos to find them an additional factor is that the demolition led to a further erosion of the womens trust towards both public health services as well as ngos for the baina women felt let down by these services agencies
2171140 now it is also difficult for ngos to have access to tb patients as the trafficked victims have spread around their behavioural pattern fear of discrimination and stigma make it difficult for them to come for treatment
2171141 often patients are dumped at the tb hospital for months together because no one is ready to take them back home due to stigma we wanted to fix responsibility and therefore we insist that someone should accompany the patient to the tb hospital and stay with them this ensures family support and takes care of patients needs besides the nursing part
2171142 as no one was ready to stay with me i made an excuse that my little child was alone at home and as there is no one to look after him i would prefer to stay at home
2171143 when you have the strong medicines to cure tb you need to have nutritious food and vitamin supplements for this they have to prostitute and to prostitute they drink alcohol alcoholism added with the kind of job they indulge in ensures that they have no discipline in life further they are stressed out depressed and have suicidal tendencies as they have no expectation from life so it is difficult to convince them to continue with the medicines
2171144 sometimes they dont reveal their proper address neither do they inform us when they go out of station this is the case with many here stopping the medicines abruptly and re starting has resulted in many cases of drug resistance in baina
2171145 with this case i was put in a peculiar situation immediate medical check up is essential under section 15 5 a of itpa and i had asked for her to be sent for medical check up had we got the reports on time there wouldnt have been any problem further i was in a fix once the state protective home in charge expressed their inability to keep her and so i had to seek the help of an ngo asro

2171149 i was talking with my co workers as well as my sister alice and we realized that there were a lot of us who liked seeing someone who dared to dress just as she pleased the idea of the wig out came to us as the perfect way for all of us to take ourselves a little less seriously to lighten up and build some community around just having fun we found some other like minded folks and the wigsters were born
2171150 world research organizations competitiveness rankings includes universities and research centers
2171151 some friends of mine work in an office they were getting really nervous from their coffee breaks so they started to have wig breaks they tried on wigs for 15 minutes they found this relaxing so thats wig therapy
2171152 all the good music has already been written by people with wigs and stuff
2171153 you know if i tell the press that i like long blonde hair the next day there will be girls with long hair wigs outside waiting for me
2171154 i had a total of 38 wigs for a start
2171155 no wigs for me with my luck id sneeze and it would come flying off me with a wig would be a disaster waiting to happen

2171228 its something that i have been struggling with for awhile believe you me aint no easy chore knowing that the survival of mankind lies right here
2171229 the messiah must be a single man a lonely hunter in order to concentrate on the task at hand which is saving the world from global warming
2171230 in my fathers house there is much global warming if it were not true i would have told you so
2171231 it was a cold tennessee night in december my earthly father albert gore sr hadnt been a senator long enough to make money from political favors so we were very poor i was born in a tobacco barn in carthage as there was no room in the highway 70 luxury lounge inn during my birth i was surrounded by very exotic animals such as goats chickens a jersey cow and a pitbull we borrowed from one of our old neighbors in the trailer park this was done so that the prophecies may be fulfilled
2171232 my mother laid me in a tobacco manger soon a bright star appeared over the tobacco barn and beckoned wisemen from the east which were mining lobbyists from washington d c so that the prophecies may be fulfilled king harold was the governor of tennessee in those ancient times king harold was afraid that i might usurp his power so he sent out a decree that every newborn male child with a watermelon sized head be put in childrens protected services so my parents took me and fled to washington d c and very rarely since then have i returned to the biblical land of tennessee
2171233 i leave you now but in my place i leave the holy global warming spirit to comfort you until my return
2171234 i might stand for election myself to be honest ive worked this out and i reckon i could sort out the country in a year and a half id definitely bring back hanging thats for starters all these violent offenders you get convicted three times by three separate juries then youre going to the gallows if by any off chance some evidence comes up that you might have been innocent and could prove it beyond reasonable doubt then your next of kin gets 500 000 vote for me the streets would be a lot safer and i could sort public transport out half a year that would take
2171235 allowing empty homes to be used in more creative ways than in the past
2171236 the general down turn in the housing market is causing the first significant rise in empty homes for many years the effects of this are already being felt in places like oldham
2171237 initiatives like property xchange are an excellent response to a changing housing market and enable empty homes to be re used by people who need homes
2171238 i think the property xchange scheme provides a fantastic support to residents im extremely pleased with my new property and am now living closer to friends and family they did a lot of work to my kitchen and bathroom before i moved in to make them more modern
2171239 the home plus plan along with the property xchange scheme took all the stress out of looking for a new home
2171240 its great being just a five minutes walk away from work and i can go for walks in the countryside now as well as sitting out in the garden which i couldnt do before ive really benefited from the move
2171241 this is one example of what we can do in response to peoples concerns giving more choice to residents has resulted in them being much more satisfied with the service we are offering them
2171242 the scheme arose from the concerns of residents affected by regeneration proposals to provide more options to help them relocate it provides a way to deal with this while at the same time bringing empty properties back into use
2171243 several properties that have been empty for a long time have successfully been returned to use enabling affected residents to relocate to an area of their choice you could say that for the council this has definitely produced a win win situation
2171244 we believe the phasing plan represents the best way forward for the aylesbury scheme which is a complex and multi faceted programme
2171245 when devising the phasing plan we have had to take a number of factors into consideration these include the physical condition of homes and how best to maintain them the physical infrastructure of the estate and how we will build around this to ensure residents receive essential services throughout the scheme we also have to regenerate the new area in the most economically viable way to ensure that we can afford to build the social housing for our tenants
2171246 we are pleased to have been able to respond to residents needs and reduce the aylesbury rehousing programme down to 15 years
2171247 our first priority in regenerating the aylesbury is ensuring residents move to good quality homes that meet their needs i am confident we will be able to achieve that goal through the implementation of this phasing programme

2171275 the langley estate has thrived from the positive working partnership between bowlee park housing and g amp j seddon
2171276 demand for langley homes is at an all time high since the turnaround of the estate it is fantastic that the work is completed and has made valuable improvements to tenants day to day lives we will continue to listen to our tenants and invest time and money into the community
2171277 it has been a pleasure to work on the langley estate with the team from bowlee park housing to improve the community for local people

2171282 in terms of numbers the number of sputum cases that are investigated has increased we are now getting cases from the remote areas even without holding medical camps or door to door medical check ups this shows that people are becoming more and more aware of the possibility of them having tb
2171283 the stigma about tb has now come down considerably it now exists only amongst the migrant or illiterate people
2171284 once you start later its always a question of catching up because its an on going process and the number of cases keep coming up
2171285 women in rural areas dont have a dominant voice in the family and due to this they fear that if detected with tb they may be isolated or rejected by family members

2171329 tb is not just a public health problem it is a social problem and the patient is stigmatised and isolated in society the failure of the health authorities to create awareness about the advances in treatment of tb has added to the woes

2171403 in americas partnership with israel we have both given support and drawn strength we are both nations founded to be beacons of democracy forged by pioneers and fulfilled by immigrants in search of a better tomorrow i join you today because we share a common cause a safe and secure jewish israel living in peace with her neighbors achieving that goal is in americas national interest the united states will stand with israel now and forever
2171404 iran is the main threat to the state of israel in the history of the state there has never been such a brutal direct threat
2171405 worst of all they may use nuclear weapons iran may be the first non deterable nuclear nation to ahmadinejad the concept of mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent but a catalyst for action this is how he gets to the messianic apocalyptic age the return of the mahdi and the establishment of islamic rule over israel millions would die on both sides but the muslim millions the believers would go to heaven iran is more dangerous as a nuclear nation than any state we have seen before
2171406 to address extremism is to address iran this is a regime which calls for the destruction of a state a member of the united nations my home israel it is a regime which denies the holocaust while threatening the world with a new one it is a regime driven by a radical religious ideology with the goal of dominating the region exporting terror and preventing peace extremists are not fighting for their own rights they are fighting to deprive others of theirs
2171407 for too long leaders of both parties in the u s have not done nearly enough to confront the threat of iran let us be very clear iran must not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon it threatens the security of israel the stability of the region and the safety of the world without hesitation or equivocation we must leverage all our economic political and diplomatic power to put pressure on iran
2171408 iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons the un security council has approved sanctions but these sanctions must be implemented and the world must keep pressure on iran
2171409 the moderate arab states know that if the palestinian conflict disappeared the iranian threat would not
2171410 an enemy with fantasies of martyrdom is not going to sit down at a table for negotiations
2171411 anyone who calls the holocaust a fairy tale is not going to recognize israel
2171412 you have an opportunity and imperative here in washington this week to fight the fallacy that we can withdraw from the fight against radical islam and make peace by sweet talking people who shout death to america and call for the destruction of israel this has never worked and it never will
2171413 senator mcconnell and i have had our public disagreements but when it comes to the peace security and freedom of israel we stand side by side the israeli people have no stronger friend than america

2171434 there is something profoundly wrong when opposition to the war in iraq seems to inspire greater passion than opposition to islamist extremism
2171435 its time to step back and start thinking together about our national interest again to say
2171436 its time to step back and remember that there is a real enemy out there an enemy violently opposed to human rights and womens rights and gay rights and the basic political rights of each one of us its time to step back and see that americas interests lie with the interests of free people everywhere and that the response to radical islam is not to abandon them but to stand with them whether they are in baghdad or teheran or jerusalem

2171483 a unity government based on hamas that will not recognize the principles of the quartet will not be recognized by the state of israel
2171484 mahmoud abbas was a guest in my home in jerusalem we had a candid and friendly talk i told him regardless of political circumstances as long as he is the elected leader of the palestinian people i will continue my cooperation with him
2171485 i believe in dialogue but some things are not up for negotiation like our right to exist we cannot and we will not negotiate our right to exist no one has the right to do so in our name further we will not negotiate about the need to accept former agreements they are the outcome of tough negotiations and mutual concessions they are not a menu to choose from and of course we will never negotiate over terror israeli lives are not bargaining chips
2171486 stagnation is not in our interest and is not our policy this is the reason that despite our disappointment from the mecca agreement we have not closed the door to dialogue with the moderates but we must understand that the chance for peace depends on a clear distinction between the moderates and the extremists being a moderate is a title that has to be earned a moderate is someone who is ready to confront terror someone who believes in the two state vision and accepts its true meaning israel remains willing to work with the moderates if they are willing to empower themselves and distinguish themselves from the enemies of peace this includes undertaking genuine efforts to release of gilad shalit who is in our prayers every day it includes bringing an end to daily attacks on israeli homes and the smuggling of weapons across the gaza egypt border and it includes preparing the palestinian people for the compromises and historic reconciliation that any true peace will require from both sides
2171487 there are those who contend that the israeli palestinian conflict is caused by israels occupation of the west bank and gaza in truth the conflict has never been about the occupation it is about the fundamental right of israel to exist peace efforts are at a standstill because of hamas failure to meet the most basic standards of the international community
2171488 never should the state of israel contract with the palestinians unless their government hamas included recognizes the sovereignty of israel and agrees to stop fomenting violence
2171489 direct foreign aid is not an entitlement unless the palestinian authority meets these basic demands of recognizing israels right to exist stopping terrorism and living up to prior agreements it will not get a dime from us
2171490 both of them have been beating me up for three months now for unknown reason i have been taking good care of their four children and doing all the household chores
2171491 i used to work in a micro financing office in the philippines but the salary was not enough to make both ends meet
2171492 the kids have grown close to me especially the youngest kid who sometimes come to me at night in the kitchen where i sleep since we only have two rooms in the flat that we are staying
2171493 she then started telling her kids not to go near me and she started slapping me on the face and hurting me i felt she was jealous of me then she began telling things to her husband which i didnt understand and he also started beating me he kicked me in my stomach

2171526 the iranian economy is dependent on a single crop 80 of the governments revenue come from oil and gas yet oil production has been shrinking 10 over the last three years iran desperately needs new investment
2171527 if this money is pulled out it does nothing for the pension funds its a drop in the bucket but for the iranians it would be enormous they have to shore up their economy or this regime will not survive perhaps ahmadinejads own rule will come tumbling down for those who say we dont want military action i say what else are you doing if we do this and it succeeds well have nullified the need for something else
2171528 divestment against israel is wrong because the target is wrong israel is a democratic country that wants peace with all its neighbors it is not a regime that is preaching genocide divestment is the right tool for iran because it openly contravenes international law
2171529 the preaching of genocide is unjust it is evil the ability to form alliances against this evil is within our reach my message to you today is very simple divest from iran divest from sudan invest in peace
2171530 talk to your governor your state treasurer your state assembly person and tell them thats its unconscionable that americans would be funding a regime that says america and israel should not exist who is building icbms to target the american mainland and who talks openly about wiping israel off the map

2171543 the annual risk of tb infection is 1 5 per cent in rest of india while in the western region especially goa the risk of tb infection is 1 9 per cent
2171544 in terms of numbers the number of sputum cases that are investigated has increased we are now getting cases from the remote areas even without holding medical camps or door to door medical check ups this shows that people are becoming more and more aware of the possibility of them having tb
2171545 the stigma about tb has now come down considerably it now exists only amongst the migrant or illiterate people
2171546 once you start later its always a question of catching up because its an on going process and the number of cases keep coming up
2171547 women in rural areas dont have a dominant voice in the family and due to this they fear that if detected with tb they may be isolated or rejected by family members

2171551 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism

2171556 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter

2171561 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
2171562 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
2171563 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
2171564 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
2171565 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space

2171580 i was shocked at the dearth of good part time work available the positions i found were clearly for entry level or unskilled workers employers must start to realize that flexible part time employment with purpose positions that utilize an employees skills and expertise while providing a work life balance will be the employment track of the future
2171581 full time positions could easily be broken up into various short term projects or as a part time job share opportunity arrangements like this enable employers to think outside the box be more flexible and hire the right talent for specific tasks
2171582 i had seen a quote from bill beattie the aim of education should be to teach us rather how to think than what to think rather to improve our minds so as to enable us to think for ourselves than to load the memory with thoughts of other men i think emep gets full points in this regard
2171583 this programme is for those who aspire to hone their skills and learn the modern management techniques and jargon but cannot devote full time for studies as the participating students are from wide spectrum of industry with rich practical experience the knowledge that is shared on the platform is of immense value which gives different dimension and approach to various issues that are discussed most importantly it needs commitment well in terms of effort time and money from the participant learning does not happen just like that as you spend years at work
2171584 it has been a year long journey of learning suddenly lazy laidback weekends were hectic hotspots for discussions quizzes and challenges while the topics covered were broadbased the biggest takeaway has been the basic tools and analytic techniques imparted that will i hope will sustain the learning process that we typically put on the backburner due to the hectic demands corporate and family life
2171585 emep had been the corner stone of my career and could not have a expected a better executive management programme than emep the highlight of the programme had been its rigor strenuous schedule comprehensive reading and grueling evaluation mechanism passion and approach demonstrated by the iimk faculty has been worth appreciating and their approach towards the programme has been the same as it has been towards the pgp course and making us and the world realize that distance doesnt matter when it comes to grooming gen nex of india
2171586 introspecting into my expectations from emep i had clearly defined tangible and intangible expectations from the emep starting with the intangibles i wanted to have a better perspective of all the functions of an organization rather that specializing into a specific one undoubtedly this course had added a huge lot of value in this regard and exceeded my expectations i also had the priviledge of comapring emep from iimk to a few other similar cources offered by other iims since a couple of very close friends and colleagues are doing it from other iims but the rigour content seriousness and pedagogy of emep is simply uncomparable at the end i am proud that i choose iimk coming to tangibles i was obviously looking at roi in terms of better job profile and a better pay cheque but to be a little frank and direct i am not very sure of exceeding my expectations on this parameter i would sum up saying that if you want an iim tag in your cv in addition to pleanty of learning and hard work sign up for emep from iimk blindly but if you are just looking for a decorative certificate there are many other cources

2171631 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2171632 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2171633 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2171634 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2171635 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2171654 stillness as an accusation of certain choreographic choices being a kind of anti dance what is provoked in the spectator when they see a dancer not dancing why the imperative for the danser to be moving all the time
2171655 one is that in moving into stillness a shape materialises a containement of energy within shape
2171656 sth that delinates the structure of the dance that little bit of space after a paragraph makes the paragraph become a paragraph and gives the shape to what preceded it
2171657 is a dance without a support no music no narrative just the dance
2171658 it intigrates force time and spacepatterns into a meaningfull whole

2171661 a source of movement for choreographers generated from the everyday behaviour and functional motion of ordinary people going aout their business
2171662 tiny muscular movements such as the raising of the brow the jerrking of the hand the tapping of the foot which have none other than expressive value

2171697 he didnt think being away from the office for a week would be worth it
2171698 and when he looked at how much it was going to cost his pac to help get him and a staff member to the convention he decided hed rather give the money to house democrats
2171699 variation sounds perky and inviting if operators do it right theyre almost certain to be successful
2171700 who is in charge of the woeful incompetence at dwp
2171701 who loves money is a scam i thought lets check who wrote this and i found out its authors are kyle and arson really i thought
2171702 what hurts the most was being so close and having so much to say and watching you walk away and never knowing what could have been and not seeing that loving you is what i was tryin to do
2171703 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2171704 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2171705 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true sen mccain continues to lie about sen obamas plan
2171706 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2171707 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2171708 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2171709 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2171710 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
2171711 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
2171712 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
2171713 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2171714 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
2171715 the u s is looking to streamline the command and control by making mckiernan essentially in charge of all u s forces in afghanistan so that one person can deploy them in support of the overall mission
2171716 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2171717 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
2171718 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2171719 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2171720 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2171721 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2171722 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2171723 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2171724 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2171725 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2171726 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2171727 secretaries of the senate have presided occasionally throughout history when for one reason or another the presiding officer either wasnt there or the senate wasnt organized
2171728 if a senator is available a senator will preside there wasnt this time
2171729 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2171730 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2171731 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2171732 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2171733 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2171734 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2171735 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2171736 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2171737 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
2171738 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
2171739 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management
2171740 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2171741 i knew the time was right and i felt i was the right person to do it
2171742 ive been to d c several times with my sister for school davis kind of gave us a cold shoulder
2171743 i think your representative should take the time of day to come out and shake your hand i like roes people not politics platform
2171744 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2171745 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know steve cohens complete record
2171746 basically the way well be appealing it is well be appealing it in the streets
2171747 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2171748 should this happen dhl will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors consumers all over america would suffer
2171749 government is too big he wants to grow it taxes are to high he wants to raise them
2171750 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2171751 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2171752 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2171753 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2171754 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2171755 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2171756 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2171757 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2171758 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2171759 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2171760 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2171761 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2171762 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2171763 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2171764 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2171765 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2171766 i will always always always put my country first i have done that from the time i was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades
2171767 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2171768 while theres no doubt senator mccain has served his country with honor the agenda hes supported over the last eight years has not served the nation as well
2171769 i dont think its about john mccain its about making obama different foreign other
2171770 these people are running a bad version of the last campaign 2008 is not 2004
2171771 i said at that time i would much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war senator obama took a different path
2171772 when we didnt work as a team they broke us down we were a team and we had leaders
2171773 half a world away another kind of love of country john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured
2171774 if you grow up here where we have no majority and theres a complete ethnic mix people have learned how to get along with others who look different and are from different places
2171775 in hawaii because we have a confined space in terms of being an island state we perhaps have to learn how to cooperate and compromise more
2171776 we learn how to listen to each other and work on things in a positive manner
2171777 hawaiis spirit of tolerance might not have been perfect or complete but it was and is real
2171778 the opportunity that hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect became an integral part of my world view and a basis for the values that i hold most dear
2171779 he himself is a child of diversity and hawaii gave him that opportunity
2171780 he believes diversity defines you rather than divides you thats the central message of change hes bringing its nothing to be afraid of
2171781 im going to see my grandma who i havent seen in 18 19 months
2171782 shes getting to the age where i want to make sure that im spending time with her on a consistent basis and so that she can see her great grandchildren i want to spend some time with those children as well
2171783 there was not even a thread of doubt in my mind
2171784 if they thought we were involved in any way they would have never left us alone we would have wound up in gitmo or some place
2171785 since things quieted down hes put his life back together again and hes in a stable environment right now
2171786 as far as i know he just wants his name cleared as publicly as it was smeared
2171787 if they had just wanted to pin this on someone we were the ideal target and they didnt do that
2171788 the one thing that everybody in the game respects about the yankees is that they play the game right they play the game hard thats what theyre known for theyre a class operation

2171842 during the past nine months alone from july 2006 to april 2007 california added roughly 2700 new autism cases what used to take 16 years in caseload growth now takes 9 months
2171843 my baby was developing typically he was a normal child and then something did happen

2171910 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2171911 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2171912 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2171913 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2171914 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2171915 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2171916 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2171917 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2171918 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2171919 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2171920 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2171921 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2171922 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2171923 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2171924 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2171925 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2171926 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2171927 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2171928 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2171929 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2171930 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2171931 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2171932 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2171933 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2171934 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2171935 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2171936 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2171937 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2171938 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2171939 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2171940 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2171941 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2171942 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2171943 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2171944 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2171945 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2171946 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2171947 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2171948 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2171949 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2171950 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2171951 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2171952 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2171953 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2171954 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2171955 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2171956 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2171957 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2171958 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2171959 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2171960 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2171961 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2171962 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2171963 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2171964 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2171965 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2171966 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2171967 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2171968 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2171969 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2171970 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2171971 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2171972 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2171973 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2171974 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2171975 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2171976 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2171977 whoever like the following three things for him hell will be near to nerve of his neck
2171978 take me to that person so that i can see him
2171979 oh man the shroud and the grave has kept you away from the allah and these two things are disturbing on your way
2171980 safety is in loneliness the person who is single and alone and who do not think about others in his heart is safe and secured because it is not good to think about others in loneliness satan devil will run away when two persons meet each other
2171981 one who is content on this then he will not require any thing from the mankind
2171982 a man is successful one who wake up hungry and sleep hungry but he should not forget the remembrance allah in that condition
2171983 one person requested him to advice him and he told him
2171984 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2171985 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be praise for himself or there will be complain against allah
2171986 one who know allah then he should get lost himself permanently in the condition of surprise
2171987 allah will give respect to that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2171988 for the money we get and for this money we should see that it is coming from halal right source and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2171989 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the pleasure of allah then one should take care of it otherwise he will not be successful in the other world after the death
2171990 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things of the heaven
2171991 all things depend upon two things first thing that is made for us and other thing which is not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2171992 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2171993 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2171994 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2171995 due to his thinking his body become thin and bones are visible on his body
2171996 inspite of this condition he is enough for the insects in the grave
2171997 the prophet came into his dream and conveyed his message that he should not over look his duties towards her mother which is better than performing the hajj
2171998 he saw her two eyes and was fallen in her love
2171999 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of two angels who are writing mens good and bad deeds
2172000 once people saw him in the winter in one simple shirt and his body was with sweat
2172001 long time ago some guests were in his house who took some soil from the neghbours wall without the permission of the owner so from that time to up till now when ever i look on the wall i regret for the act of my guests and this is the reason of my sweat even though the neighbor already forgiven me for this mistake
2172002 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2172003 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2172004 oh otaiba be pity on your condition and he replied her
2172005 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2172006 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2172007 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i will not look at the world
2172008 once some body told him that many persons used to ask about your affairs
2172009 that person asked for the fresh dates and as there was no season of dates at that time but at the same time he gave him a bag full of dates to him
2172010 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2172011 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2172012 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his
2172013 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2172014 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2172015 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2172016 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2172017 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2172018 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2172019 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2172020 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2172021 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2172022 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2172023 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2172024 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2172025 it was reported that a fire worshipper once imprisoned him
2172026 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2172027 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2172028 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2172029 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2172030 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2172031 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2172032 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind
2172033 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2172034 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2172035 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2172036 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2172037 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2172038 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2172039 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2172040 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2172041 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him
2172042 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2172043 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2172044 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2172045 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2172046 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2172047 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2172048 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2172049 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2172050 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2172051 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2172052 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2172053 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2172054 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects
2172055 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2172056 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2172057 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2172058 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he died in the year 204 a h at the age of 54 years 19 th
2172059 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2172060 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2172061 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2172062 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2172063 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2172064 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2172065 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same
2172066 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2172067 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2172068 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2172069 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2172070 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2172071 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2172072 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from
2172073 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2172074 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2172075 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2172076 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2172077 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the private or public place and in both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2172078 he rewarded for raising one of his hand and if he raised the another one then we will have given the reward for that hand also
2172079 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2172080 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the weeping there were tears in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2172081 he thought caliph a bad man but he never told this to the people in this matter so that people may not think me sincere and truthful and for this i will leave this world in insincere condition
2172082 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2172083 some persons asked with saleh bin abdul karim which thing is good in the following
2172084 both are good but hopefulness is better than the fear
2172085 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep us away from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2172086 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and do not keep too much hopefulness for which you will be out of fear from the punishment
2172087 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2172088 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2172089 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2172090 if a man busy himself in the worship then in the meadows of heaven the angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2172091 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2172092 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say the meaning of humility which is as follows
2172093 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons were used to get cure but the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2172094 in the past in which the preachers think preaching a difficult task same like the persons of present time find difficulty to act upon the knowledge in the present time there is shortage of learned people like the shortage of preachers in the past
2172095 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy
2172096 awouze billah min shaitan nirjaim wa bilhaqe nazalna wa bilhaque nazal
2172097 so when i came back to him and explained him all the details which happened on the way
2172098 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2172099 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who are married in that world and suffered difficulties to maintain them
2172100 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2172101 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah
2172102 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2172103 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2172104 to day i will be free from the worldly grief and sorrow
2172105 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2172106 as he left over the worldly affairs so there is no such great learned person like him
2172107 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2172108 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2172109 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents and for telling this i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2172110 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2172111 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2172112 as per tradition of the prophet if some body get some thing without his desire then he should accept it otherwise it will be regarded as ungratefulness of allahs grace
2172113 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2172114 he acquired knowledge from abdals an order of saints for a period of 30 years and they advised me to keep away from the mankind and eat less
2172115 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2172116 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2172117 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2172118 oven is hot and so it will be done as per his order
2172119 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2172120 he is too much busy in the worship of allah so how he will look at them
2172121 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2172122 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2172123 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2172124 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time he used to eat in makkah
2172125 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2172126 you will not get mysticism because i have promised with allah that i will not put forward my hands toward haram illlegal things
2172127 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2172128 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today
2172129 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2172130 what is your opinion about revelation and miracles of your disciples
2172131 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2172132 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2172133 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2172134 one person invited him but he did not accepted his invitation and for this punishment he did not ate any thing for fourteen days
2172135 a true person is one who feels pleasure of action before action is done sincerity is an action in which there is pleasure of worship
2172136 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval and so allah can keep me in any condition what ever he likes
2172137 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2172138 my bravery demands me to wear the dress of mysticism and follow their ways the bravery which require from you is to take down the dress of mysticism and in this way by remembrance of allah you can attain good position so that the world may not attract you
2172139 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2172140 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2172141 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2172142 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2172143 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2172144 he should not be angry with any body for the sake of matters of the world
2172145 the meaning of zahed mysticism is to be content for what ever one gets and do not desire more than that
2172146 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2172147 he will widen the means for his wisdom and sagacity as he respected his name
2172148 first he wanted to be free andsecond may allah grant repentance for his master and third he should get reward for the helping the darwesh person so he may get returned back his four dirhams
2172149 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that meeting and mansur amer
2172150 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2172151 oh the people of faith protect yourself your family members and your sole from the fire of hell
2172152 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2172153 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2172154 the heart of mystic saint is the center of remembrance of allah
2172155 the heart is source of light and if the desire of the world enters into ones heart then that light will finish in him and darkness will cover it
2172156 allah blessed him and asked him to do praise and eulogy for him in presence of angels same as he used to praise and eulogy for him in the other world
2172157 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2172158 prophet younus pbuh thought that allah will not be angry with him but for him allah sent a great difficulty on him
2172159 to have faith in allahto be away from the mankindto speak sincerelyto bear the hardships of endurance for the right way
2172160 belief is the gift of light of allah with which one can observe the affairs of the next world as there will be no curtains for him
2172161 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers than wealth and children
2172162 due to the blessing of allah man got the following four things
2172163 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is good for the next world
2172164 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless
2172165 the best desire is that which will solve our problems
2172166 those who leave the sins and then they can hope from allah for his grace
2172167 if you want to become more important than others so for this thing leave every thing and then you can keep trust in allah so that you can see all others standing in need of you
2172168 we have created jinn and human beings for my worship
2172169 to sacrifice the life for the sake of allah and if you can not do this then leave to act upon the sayings of the mystic persons
2172170 he was regret to know that you had sold away your religion for the value of two particles of gold because at the time purchasing some thing from some body you told him the price five times less to the salesman which the owner of the shop told you and due to your status of dignity the salesman believed your statement and sold away the thing at the lesser price
2172171 to learn quran for worldly gains is not useful and it is very bad thing
2172172 the truthful worship of one night is better than the incursion
2172173 you are a slave so for the slave there will be no comfort at all availabe to him
2172174 during the worship pray with more attention and take care so that you can get the benefit from it
2172175 you got your punishment of your thought and if you thought more than this then you will get more punishment than this
2172176 for a period of 13 years as per his thinking as an abstinent he had performed hajs but upon his re thinking he find all his hajs were based upon the psychological desires because once my mother told me to bring the water pot and that order was unpleasant for me so i think all my hajs were not free from the psychological desires
2172177 as you looked other than us so we had taken back your dress of pious persons if you do this mistake again then we will also take back your dress of the innermost
2172178 here i find the recitation of quran and the worship style which is not as per my standard
2172179 say if it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred the wealth that ye have gained the commerce in which ye fear a decline or the dwellings in which ye delight
2172180 quran 9 24 the signs of love of allah are as follows revelations miracles piety he met many great pious personalities of his time he left his native place busanji and lived in
2172181 i know well that you did not stolen my donkey but i know also that allah will accept your prayers and will not accept my prayers so i caused you trouble for it
2172182 i do not blame you for this act and this is not from you and i think allah will not commit mistakes
2172183 he is kidher for which you were eager to meet with me
2172184 then the boy due to the fear of allah died suddenly
2172185 how sad this thing is that the boy died due to the fear of one verse upon its reading but there was no effect upon me as i am reading the holy quran since many years
2172186 due to the fear of allah he will not stay in the mosque for the longer time after his regular prayers
2172187 the shortage of wealth is useful in the both worlds and its increase is harmful in the both worlds
2172188 the position of humility because i do not have strength to bear such difficulties of the prophets
2172189 i can convert a muslim to disbeliever within seconds and for this i will make him greedy of harm illegal things and prevalence of desires in him and then he will commits sins and after that i will put into him misgiving of the disbelief
2172190 the man was created by many things but two items of water and soil are more in him
2172191 in the water many colors and tastes are there and for this reason it is difficult for us to know its taste
2172192 we have given life to all things by the water
2172193 the best indigent person is one from whom the kings could not ask the revenue and on the day of judgment allah will not ask for his accountability
2172194 abu ali you always think for yourself and you did not think for others
2172195 you asked me to recite kalima but i swear in the name of grace of allah that in between us nothing is there except his dignity and by saying this he left this world
2172196 we had sent the tiger for you so by holding the tigers legs you should come out of the well
2172197 due to your trust we had helped you by your killer
2172198 due to this miracle he accepted the religion of islam
2172199 he find no religion better than the religion of islam
2172200 he used to tell one who will get happiness from other than allah then he will not get the real happiness
2172201 oh free man what do you want and he relied you are strange pious person who are looking other than allah
2172202 due to the respect of allah i never stretched my legs in the loneliness
2172203 one of our beloved person has asked you to bring some sweet but you ignore his request
2172204 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2172205 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years

2172207 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2172208 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family

2172210 i have not seen such a flood in the river kaveri in the first week of may ever in my life oh treacherous of mysore you should have waited for one more day as the god was willing to help us but you have missed that chance on that day if you had not opened the doors of srirangapatnam then we could have defeated the enemy without wasting our single bullet
2172211 oh my friends for this day the sultan was waiting how unfortunate we are that the clouds which would have witnessed our success they are washing the tears of our defeated soldiers

2172217 the more i look at it the more i like it the typography along with the increased use of screen has made a visual improvement making it clearer and easier to read or skim i dont like the fact that the homepage feels like a very very long sheet of paper which is
2172218 one of the main complaints from people in less economically developing countries is the fact that they cant help themselves having to rely on help from others to survive

2172292 this article is presented as a last gap effort to derail the zba permitting process should either of the previous two articles not receive 2 3 votes of those attending town meeting the intent here is to nullify the memorandum of understanding by adding editing and omitting a vast number of minute details related to construction of the residential buildings the nursing rehabilitation facility set backs vehicular access waste water treatment indemnification and numerous other components carefully negotiated by sharon s board of selectmen under guidance from town counsel
2172293 all three initiatives share the same objective to reverse the will of town meeting and terminate the project each article requires 2 3 majority vote to pass these articles appear as citizen initiatives but are being legally and tactically advised by non residents if you want sharons future to be financially stable our police and fire departments to meet increasing service demands expanded water capacity and our schools able to provide urgently needed resources then you mst come to town meeting 7pm monday november 05 and vote down all three articles

2172323 this has got the fingerprints of the governor all over it
2172324 we made sure the appropriate legislative staff were made aware that this project was proceeding
2172325 hes very concerned about maintaining good communication with the legislature
2172326 the issue for the administration was getting the chamber into compliance with the judges order and we were clear that that needed to happen as quickly as possible
2172327 a death chamber just doesnt get built on its own
2172328 we need for the governor to come clean on who directed this who authorized this and at what point
2172329 we need to really understand their intent to evade and deceive
2172330 if they want to outlaw the death penalty start gathering signatures
2172331 do not use legislative hearings as bully pulpits to subvert the will of the people and circumvent state law
2172332 we think this shows the emphasis of cdcr will always be about punishment
2172333 cdcr is trying to find a humane way to commit an inhumane act and we just dont think thats possible
2172334 i think we have to question the oversight the accountability the truthfulness of this administration and this department in handling and properly managing the taxpayers dollars
2172335 i think from what we have found we should have serious concerns about money that is allocated to this department

2172340 we are enjoying the moment but they are sad i have good feelings for them the game was amazing and they were a big part of the game
2172341 it is a big big final between the first and second in the premiership

2172451 institusi agama tertinggi di mesir universiti al azhar bercadang untuk mengeluarkan fatwa rasmi mengharuskan pengambilan faedah bank yang dipanggil dengan istilah baru pulangan bukan lagi faedah kerana istilah itu lebih difahami sebagai riba atau bunga menurut istilah perbankan yang diguna pakai pada hari ini fatwa berani al azhar ini dijangka ditentang oleh banyak pihak sama ada di dalam mahupun di luar mesir bagaimanapun tidak dapat dinafikan bahawa banyak juga pihak yang menyokong fatwa al azhar itu ini kerana faedah bank itu sendiri sebenarnya merupakan masalah hilafiah yang menyebabkan perbezaan pandangan di kalangan ulama sejak bank bank mula diperkenalkan kepada umat islam malah apa yang dianggap riba dan bukan riba itu juga menjadi tajuk perbezaan pandangan para ulama sejak beratus ratus tahun ini kerana ayat ayat al quran yang memperuntukkan pengharaman riba itu tergolong daripada ayat ayat terakhir yang diturunkan kepada rasulullah s a w iaitu ayat ayat yang memutuskan hukuman terhadap orang yang makan atau mengambil riba tetapi rasulullah tidak sempat melaksanakan peruntukan hukum yang mengandungi ayat ayat berkenaan dengan memberi contoh di alam nyata secara lebih sempurna seperti dengan peruntukan peruntukan hukum yang lain al qurtubi dalam kitab tafsirnya menceritakan bahawa ayat ayat riba tergolong daripada ayat ayat al quran terakhir yang diturunkan al qurtubi tafsir al qurtubi juz 1 muka surat 152 hal demikian menjadi masalah dan kemusykilan bukan sedikit kepada ulama dengan itu ibn kathir dalam kitab tafsirnya berkata bab riba merupakan bab yang paling bermusykil bagi ramai ulama tafsir ibn kathir juz 1 muka 328 itulah antara punca yang menyebabkan berlaku perbezaan pandangan ulama terdahulu mengenai riba dan seterusnya berlaku pada zaman ini mengenai faedah bank sesetengah ulama berkata riba itu haram secara mutlak sesetengah yang lain berpendapat ada riba yang halal seperti memberi lebihan wang kepada orang yang meminjamkan wang kepada kita sebagai hadiah atau sedekah mengenai faedah bank pula ada yang mengatakan ia merupakan bunga yang haram seperti pendapat ramai ulama zaman ini termasuk dr yusuf al qaradawi tetapi ada pula yang berkata faedah bank itu halal tetapi bukan secara mutlak seperti syeikh al azhar syeikh dr mohammed sayed tantawi dan ulama ulama sebelum beliau seperti bekas syeikh al azhar syeikh mahmoud shaltut syeikh rashid redha syeikh mohammad abduh dan lain lain kembali kepada fatwa terbaru al azhar badan penyelidikan akademik al azhar majma al buhuth al islamiah yang mengadakan perjumpaan pada 31 oktober lalu memutuskan bahawa faedah bank adalah halal dan al azhar akan mengeluarkan fatwa rasmi mengenainya tidak lama lagi perjumpaan yang dipengerusikan oleh dr tantawi itu dihadiri oleh menteri wakaf mesir dr mahmoud hamdi zaqzouq rektor universiti al azhar dr omar hashim mufti rumah fatwa mesir dr ahmad al taiyyeb syeikh mohammed al rawi bekas rektor al azhar dr abdel fattah al syeikh dr badr al meniyawi dr abdel muti baiyumi dr abdel rahma al adawi dr mohammad rafat othman dr sofi abu taleb dr taha abu krisha dr mohammed ibrahim al faiyumi dr ragab al baiyumi dan dr hassan zaki abbas dua daripada ahli majma al buhuth al islamiah persidangan kajian islam iaitu dr al syeikh dan dr othman menentang fatwa menghalalkan faedah bank itu bagaimanapun dr al syeikh tidak menentang sepenuhnya fatwa berkenaan kerana pada dasarnya beliau bersetuju dengannya tetapi tidak bersetuju menghalalkannya secara mutlak kerana beliau menganggap transaksi kewangan berbeza daripada satu bank dengan bank yang lain beliau menuntut dinilai setiap transaksi kewangan sesetiap bank itu secara objektif di mana jika ia tidak bercanggah dengan hukum islam diharuskan dan jika sebaliknya diharamkan beliau berkata melaburkan wang dalam bank itu harus kerana bank tersebut dianggap menjadi wakil pelabur tetapi bank tidak melaburkan wang yang diamanah kepadanya itu untuk projek projek yang bercanggah dengan hukum islam seperti mendirikan kilang arak ladang pemeliharaan babi dan perkara perkara haram yang lain pandangan dr al syeikh ini sebenarnya tidak begitu berbeza dengan pandangan lama dr tantawi ketika beliau masih menjadi mufti rumah fatwa mesir darul ifta pada tahun 1980 an dan 1990 an ini kerana dr tantawi juga berpendapat bahawa hanya bank bank nasional yang faedahnya dianggap halal sedangkan bank bank yang dimiliki oleh orang luar terutama yahudi dianggap haram ahli majma al buhuth al islamiah kedua yang menentang fatwa menghalalkan faedah bank iaitu dr mohammed rafat othman pula menolak fatwa tersebut secara mutlak ini kerana beliau menganggap faedah bank dalam semua bentuk adalah haram belaka walaupun diandaikan ia bukan riba kerana mudarabahnya dianggap tidak sah mudarabah bermaksud kongsi untung rugi profit loss sharing dalam pelaburan atau perniagaan menurut pandangan fiqh yang dipegang oleh dr othman ini pelaburan atau perniagaan itu mesti ada unsur untung dan rugi atau berisiko baru boleh dianggap sah dari segi hukum dr tantawi dan majoriti ahli majma al buhuth al islamiah tidak berpegang pada pandangan fiqh itu sebaliknya mereka mengikut pandangan fiqh yang lain yang memperuntukkan bahawa pelabur atau penyimpan wang dalam bank untuk pelaburan berhak memperoleh jaminan bahawa pelaburannya selamat dan pulangannya terjamin menurutnya tidak berlaku penganiayaan jika berlaku sesuatu terhadap bank kerana ia milik negara atau dijamin olehnya dengan itu mereka mengharuskan pelaburan wang dalam bank yang menetapkan kadar pulangan keuntungan terlebih dahulu kerana perbuatan itu dianggap sebagai al wikalah perwakilan yang bermaksud bank menjadi wakil kepada pelabur dalam melaburkan wangnya dalam projek projek pembangunan ekonomi negara pelaburan dalam bank seperti itu tidak dianggap bersubahat dengan riba dan tidak dianggap seseorang itu menindas ke atas orang lain dr baiyumi berkata bahawa apa yang diputuskan oleh majma al buhuth al islamiah ialah dibenarkan melaburkan wang dalam bank yang ditetapkan pulangan terlebih dulu untuk dilaburkan ini bererti wang yang dilaburkan dalam bank itu bertujuan untuk pelaburan dan bukan untuk mengambil faedah tanpa pelaburan menurut dr abdel muti al baiyumi seseorang yang melaburkan wang untuk mendapatkan pulangan dalam bank seperti itu tergolong daripada al wikalah yang tidak bercanggah dengan hukum syarak selain itu ia menetapkan pulangan juga dapat memberi perlindungan kepada penyimpan atau pelabur dan ia tidak dianggap riba kerana perkara itu berlaku antara kerajaan bank bank kerajaan atau bank bank jaminannya dan rakyat fatwa majma al buhuth itu dianggap bercanggah dengan keputusan persidangan majma al buhuth al islamiah kedua yang diadakan di kaherah pada tahun 1965 persidangan yang dihadiri 35 buah negara itu memutuskan secara konsensus bahawa faedah bank dalam segala bentuk dianggap haram berdasarkan nas nas yang muktamad daripada al quran dan sunah malah ia juga dianggap bercanggah dengan keputusan persidangan kedua majlis perhimpunan fiqh islam majlis majma al fiqh al islami yang diadakan di jeddah pada 22 28 disember 1985 perhimpunan fiqh islam adalah salah satu pertubuhan dalam pertubuhan persidangan islam oic begitu juga dengan ketetapan persidangan majlis fiqh islam yang diadakan di mekah pada 23 30 mac 1989 perlu diterangkan bahawa semua keputusan persidangan tersebut dibuat berdasarkan pandangan fiqh yang dipegang oleh dr othman seperti yang disebut di atas ia tidak sama sekali berdasarkan nas nas yang muktamad seperti didakwa dr yusuf al qaradawi dan ramai ulama lain di dunia arab turut berpegang dengan pandangan fiqh yang sama malah jika kita merujuk kepada perdebatan antara dua golongan yang berpegang dengan pandangan fiqh berbeza ini didapati bahawa dr al qaradawi adalah penentang dr tantawi dr tantawi ketika itu belum lagi dilantik menjadi syeikh al azhar tetapi beliau telah pun menjadi mufti rumah fatwa mesir penulis pernah membincangkan mengenai perdebatan antara dua ulama besar mesir itu dalam tulisan tulisan yang lalu jadi tidak perlu diulang perbincangan di sini sekali lagi pokoknya ketika itu ramai yang menyokong dr al qaradawi termasuk bekas syeikh al azhar al marhum syeikh gadul had ali gadul haq ulama ulama dalam majma al buhuth al islamiah yang terlibat dalam mengeluarkan fatwa menghalalkan faedah bank di atas walaupun ada yang dikenali menyokong dr tantawi ketika itu tetapi semuanya berdiam diri kerana tidak dapat melawan arus tetapi selepas lebih 15 tahun baru mereka berani muncul bersama dr tantawi dan menyediakan fatwa yang mungkin sedikit masa nanti menjadi kecoh di seluruh dunia islam selain itu dr al qaradawi sendiri semakin kurang menyerang dr tantawi selepas dr tantawi dilantik menjadi syeikh al azhar pada pertengahan tahun 1990 an malah dr al qaradawi juga semakin kurang membincangkan tentang faedah bank selepas beliau turut mengkritik apa yang dipanggil bank islam atau bank muamalat penubuhan cawangan muamalat di bank bank konvensional yang menggunakan konsep riba juga dikritik oleh beliau
2172452 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
2172453 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
2172454 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
2172455 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
2172456 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
2172457 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
2172458 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
2172459 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
2172460 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
2172461 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
2172462 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
2172463 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
2172464 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
2172465 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
2172466 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
2172467 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
2172468 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
2172469 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
2172470 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
2172471 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
2172472 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
2172473 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
2172474 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
2172475 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
2172476 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
2172477 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2172478 if were trying to build a normal modern democratic european society there is no excuse for holding onto weapons and ive already started that debate
2172479 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
2172480 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2172481 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2172482 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
2172483 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
2172484 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
2172485 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
2172486 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
2172487 aku berwasiat kepada kamu untuk bertakwa kepada allah taat dan patuh kepada pemimpin walaupun yang memimpin kamu seorang hamba abdi berkulit hitam sesungguhnya sesiapa di antara kamu yang masih hidup setelah aku tiada dia akan melihat banyak perselisihan maka hendaklah kamu berpegang teguh kepada sunnahku dan sunnah khulafa al rasyidun yang mendapat petunjuk gigitlah ia dengan geraham iaitu berpeganglah dengan kuat dan hendaklah kamu menjauhi perkara yang baru kerana setiap perkara baru itu adalah bidaah dan setiap bidaah itu sesat

2172635 public opinion will be led to adopt without knowing it the proposals that we dare not present to them directly all the earlier proposals will be in the new text but will be hidden and disguised in some way

2172643 many of us have noticed that suddenly after 9 11 and the american response of war in afghanistan the hunger for information about muslim women seems insatiable
2172644 i ask myself about the very strong appeal of this notion of
2172645 the point about womens veiling is of course too complicated to lay out here
2172646 the precepts of liberal political philosophy were introduced into non western societies including muslim societies through colonial rule and an expanding system of global capitalist power through institutions of law governance trade and commerce over the course of two centuries
2172647 a second example i want to give here of the hegemony liberalism commands in discourses of resistance is the prominence given to the ideal of individual freedom and autonomy within postcolonial feminist projects
2172648 the remarks i made that you quote from were a product of the dissatisfaction i had come to feel with feminist analyses of the islamic movements in particular and conservative religious movements in general
2172649 i think one of the reasons why the burqa or the veil took such center stage in the feminist mobilization against the taliban in the united states is due to the overdetermined status of the veil in western history particularly the colonial and orientalist legacy that made the veil a symbol of islams inferior status vis vis
2172650 is womens adoption of regimes of dieting exercising and various body enhancement techniques in euro american societies simply an expression of their false consciousness or is ones relationship to cultural values its standards of sexual physical and personal worth more complicated than the false consciousness thesis allows

2172680 why doesnt the fst do a better job helping the officers reach the correct decision
2172681 again it should be pointed out that all the evidence from these data suggest it is unrealistic to attempt to use behavioral tests to discriminate bacs in a 02 margin around a given level
2172682 obviously an error rate of 46 5 percent in making arrests is not acceptable
2172683 nystagmus on the other hand was not a highly rated test first burns and moskowitz evaluated tests with respect to the relationship between performance on the test and blood alcohol concentration bac a close relationship between these two variables does not necessarily imply a close relationship between performance on the nystagmus test and driving performance or between test performance and accidents specifically it is not apparent that performance on the nystagmus test reflects any skills related to driving in addition examining a driver for nystagmus may be difficult operationally and somewhat unsafe scoring is quite subjective and would require careful training for the test administrator

2172737 what do you think what do you see how can we get past this
2172738 because water evaporates and creates clouds and they become cold and it rains
2172739 reality is a perpetual becoming it makes or remakes itself but it is never something made
2172740 i e the development of an organism exactly mirrors the evolutionary development of the species the early version of this hypothesis has since been rejected as being oversimplified 13
2172741 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2172742 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2172743 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2172744 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2172745 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2172746 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2172747 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2172748 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2172749 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2172750 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2172751 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2172752 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2172753 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2172754 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2172755 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2172756 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2172757 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2172758 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2172759 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2172760 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2172761 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2172762 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2172763 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2172764 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2172765 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2172766 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2172767 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2172768 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2172769 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2172770 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2172771 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2172772 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2172773 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2172774 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2172775 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2172776 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2172777 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2172778 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2172779 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2172780 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2172781 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2172782 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind he looks after camels and gets some money for the food and clothes for his mother
2172783 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2172784 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2172785 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2172786 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2172787 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2172788 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2172789 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2172790 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2172791 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2172792 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2172793 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2172794 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2172795 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2172796 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2172797 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2172798 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2172799 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2172800 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2172801 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2172802 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2172803 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2172804 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2172805 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2172806 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2172807 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2172808 whoever like the following three things for him hell will be near to nerve of his neck
2172809 take me to that person so that i can see him
2172810 oh man the shroud and the grave has kept you away from the allah and these two things are disturbing on your way
2172811 safety is in loneliness the person who is single and alone and who do not think about others in his heart is safe and secured because it is not good to think about others in loneliness satan devil will run away when two persons meet each other
2172812 one who is content on this then he will not require any thing from the mankind
2172813 a man is successful one who wake up hungry and sleep hungry but he should not forget the remembrance allah in that condition
2172814 i will advice you to become the king of this world and other world after death so you should become ascetic in the world and do not greed and temptation with others and think that all creations are given every thing from allah and then he will be free from the needs and resigned from all others in this way he will become the king of the two worlds
2172815 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2172816 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be praise for himself or there will be complain against allah
2172817 one who know allah then he should get lost himself permanently in the condition of surprise
2172818 allah will give respect to that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2172819 for the money we get and for this money we should see that it is coming from halal right source and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2172820 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the pleasure of allah then one should take care of it otherwise he will not be successful in the other world after the death
2172821 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things of the heaven
2172822 all things depend upon two things first thing that is made for us and other thing which is not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2172823 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2172824 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2172825 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2172826 due to his thinking his body become thin and bones are visible on his body
2172827 inspite of this condition he is enough for the insects in the grave
2172828 the prophet came into his dream and conveyed his message that he should not over look his duties towards her mother which is better than performing the hajj
2172829 he saw her two eyes and was fallen in her love
2172830 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of two angels who are writing mens good and bad deeds
2172831 long time ago some guests were in his house who took some soil from the neghbours wall without the permission of the owner so from that time to up till now when ever i look on the wall i regret for the act of my guests and this is the reason of my sweat even though the neighbor already forgiven me for this mistake
2172832 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2172833 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2172834 oh otaiba be pity on your condition and he replied her
2172835 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2172836 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2172837 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i will not look at the world
2172838 that person asked for the fresh dates and as there was no season of dates at that time but at the same time he gave him a bag full of dates to him
2172839 his name is ghulam jabbar slave of jabbar so he is walking proudly and at the same time he became un conscious and fallen on the ground
2172840 once in his student life he saw a beautiful boy with long beard and moustaches
2172841 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2172842 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2172843 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his
2172844 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2172845 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2172846 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2172847 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2172848 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2172849 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2172850 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2172851 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2172852 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2172853 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2172854 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2172855 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2172856 it was reported that a fire worshipper once imprisoned him
2172857 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2172858 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2172859 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2172860 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2172861 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2172862 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2172863 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind
2172864 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2172865 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2172866 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2172867 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2172868 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2172869 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2172870 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2172871 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2172872 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him
2172873 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2172874 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2172875 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2172876 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2172877 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2172878 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2172879 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2172880 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2172881 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2172882 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2172883 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2172884 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2172885 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects
2172886 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2172887 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2172888 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2172889 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he died in the year 204 a h at the age of 54 years episode from
2172890 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2172891 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2172892 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2172893 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2172894 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2172895 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2172896 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same
2172897 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2172898 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2172899 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2172900 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2172901 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2172902 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2172903 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from
2172904 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2172905 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2172906 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2172907 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2172908 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the private or public place and in both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2172909 he rewarded for raising one of his hand and if he raised the another one then we will have given the reward for that hand also
2172910 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2172911 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the weeping there were tears in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2172912 he thought caliph a bad man but he never told this to the people in this matter so that people may not think me sincere and truthful and for this i will leave this world in insincere condition
2172913 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2172914 some persons asked with saleh bin abdul karim which thing is good in the following
2172915 both are good but hopefulness is better than the fear
2172916 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep us away from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2172917 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and do not keep too much hopefulness for which you will be out of fear from the punishment
2172918 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2172919 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2172920 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2172921 if a man busy himself in the worship then in the meadows of heaven the angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2172922 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2172923 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say the meaning of humility which is as follows
2172924 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons were used to get cure but the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2172925 in the past in which the preachers think preaching a difficult task same like the persons of present time find difficulty to act upon the knowledge in the present time there is shortage of learned people like the shortage of preachers in the past
2172926 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy so tell him to put the hand on place of pain and recite this verse
2172927 awouze billah min shaitan nirjaim wa bilhaqe nazalna wa bilhaque nazal
2172928 so when i came back to him and explained him all the details which happened on the way he recited the verse and put the hand on the place of pain and he was recovered from the illness at once and told him he was khizer as
2172929 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2172930 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who are married in that world and suffered difficulties to maintain them
2172931 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2172932 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah
2172933 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2172934 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2172935 to day i will be free from the worldly grief and sorrow
2172936 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2172937 as he left over the worldly affairs so there is no such great learned person like him
2172938 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2172939 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2172940 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents and for telling this i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2172941 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2172942 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2172943 as per tradition of the prophet if some body get some thing without his desire then he should accept it otherwise it will be regarded as ungratefulness of allahs grace
2172944 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2172945 he acquired knowledge from abdals an order of saints for a period of 30 years and they advised me to keep away from the mankind and eat less
2172946 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2172947 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2172948 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2172949 oven is hot and so it will be done as per his order
2172950 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2172951 he is too much busy in the worship of allah so how he will look at them
2172952 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2172953 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2172954 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2172955 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time he used to eat in makkah
2172956 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2172957 you will not get mysticism because i have promised with allah that i will not put forward my hands toward haram illlegal things
2172958 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2172959 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today
2172960 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2172961 what is your opinion about revelation and miracles of your disciples
2172962 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2172963 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2172964 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2172965 one person invited him but he did not accepted his invitation and for this punishment he did not ate any thing for fourteen days
2172966 a true person is one who feels pleasure of action before action is done sincerity is an action in which there is pleasure of worship
2172967 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval and so allah can keep me in any condition what ever he likes
2172968 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2172969 my bravery demands me to wear the dress of mysticism and follow their ways the bravery which require from you is to take down the dress of mysticism and in this way by remembrance of allah you can attain good position so that the world may not attract you
2172970 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2172971 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2172972 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2172973 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2172974 asking for more will cause difficulties to think sole as better will create proud if one who follows his sole then he will become blind so he will be away from the right path always think yourself as worst and due to fear do not look at sottis person because there will be affected from him
2172975 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2172976 he should not be angry with any body for the sake of matters of the world
2172977 the meaning of zahed mysticism is to be content for what ever one gets and do not desire more than that
2172978 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2172979 he will widen the means for his wisdom and sagacity as he respected his name
2172980 first he wanted to be free andsecond may allah grant repentance for his master and third he should get reward for the helping the darwesh person so he may get returned back his four dirhams
2172981 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that meeting and mansur amer
2172982 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2172983 oh the people of faith protect yourself your family members and your sole from the fire of hell
2172984 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2172985 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2172986 the heart of mystic saint is the center of remembrance of allah
2172987 the heart is source of light and if the desire of the world enters into ones heart then that light will finish in him and darkness will cover it
2172988 allah blessed him and asked him to do praise and eulogy for him in presence of angels same as he used to praise and eulogy for him in the other world
2172989 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2172990 prophet younus pbuh thought that allah will not be angry with him but for him allah sent a great difficulty on him
2172991 to have faith in allahto be away from the mankindto speak sincerelyto bear the hardships of endurance for the right way
2172992 belief is the gift of light of allah with which one can observe the affairs of the next world as there will be no curtains for him
2172993 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers than wealth and children
2172994 due to the blessing of allah man got the following four things
2172995 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is good for the next world
2172996 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless
2172997 the best desire is that which will solve our problems
2172998 those who leave the sins and then they can hope from allah for his grace
2172999 if you want to become more important than others so for this thing leave every thing and then you can keep trust in allah so that you can see all others standing in need of you
2173000 we have created jinn and human beings for my worship
2173001 to sacrifice the life for the sake of allah and if you can not do this then leave to act upon the sayings of the mystic persons
2173002 he was regret to know that you had sold away your religion for the value of two particles of gold because at the time purchasing some thing from some body you told him the price five times less to the salesman which the owner of the shop told you and due to your status of dignity the salesman believed your statement and sold away the thing at the lesser price
2173003 to learn quran for worldly gains is not useful and it is very bad thing
2173004 the truthful worship of one night is better than the incursion
2173005 you are a slave so for the slave there will be no comfort at all availabe to him
2173006 during the worship pray with more attention and take care so that you can get the benefit from it
2173007 you got your punishment of your thought and if you thought more than this then you will get more punishment than this
2173008 for a period of 13 years as per his thinking as an abstinent he had performed hajs but upon his re thinking he find all his hajs were based upon the psychological desires because once my mother told me to bring the water pot and that order was unpleasant for me so i think all my hajs were not free from the psychological desires
2173009 as you looked other than us so we had taken back your dress of pious persons if you do this mistake again then we will also take back your dress of the innermost
2173010 here i find the recitation of quran and the worship style which is not as per my standard
2173011 say if it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred the wealth that ye have gained the commerce in which ye fear a decline or the dwellings in which ye delight
2173012 quran 9 24 the signs of love of allah are as follows
2173013 i know well that you did not stolen my donkey but i know also that allah will accept your prayers and will not accept my prayers so i caused you trouble for it
2173014 i do not blame you for this act and this is not from you and i think allah will not commit mistakes
2173015 he is kidher for which you were eager to meet with me
2173016 then the boy due to the fear of allah died suddenly
2173017 how sad this thing is that the boy died due to the fear of one verse upon its reading but there was no effect upon me as i am reading the holy quran since many years
2173018 due to the fear of allah he will not stay in the mosque for the longer time after his regular prayers
2173019 the shortage of wealth is useful in the both worlds and its increase is harmful in the both worlds
2173020 the position of humility because i do not have strength to bear such difficulties of the prophets
2173021 i can convert a muslim to disbeliever within seconds and for this i will make him greedy of harm illegal things and prevalence of desires in him and then he will commits sins and after that i will put into him misgiving of the disbelief
2173022 the man was created by many things but two items of water and soil are more in him
2173023 we have given life to all things by the water
2173024 the best indigent person is one from whom the kings could not ask the revenue and on the day of judgment allah will not ask for his accountability
2173025 abu ali you always think for yourself and you did not think for others
2173026 you asked me to recite kalima but i swear in the name of grace of allah that in between us nothing is there except his dignity and by saying this he left this world
2173027 we had sent the tiger for you so by holding the tigers legs you should come out of the well
2173028 due to your trust we had helped you by your killer
2173029 due to this miracle he accepted the religion of islam
2173030 he find no religion better than the religion of islam
2173031 oh free man what do you want and he relied you are strange pious person who are looking other than allah
2173032 due to the respect of allah i never stretched my legs in the loneliness he gained knowledge from abdallah tastari
2173033 one of our beloved person has asked you to bring some sweet but you ignore his request
2173034 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2173035 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years

2173044 i really dont see anything romantic in proposing it is very romantic to be in love but there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal why one may be accepted one usually is i believe then the excitement is all over the very essence of romance is uncertainty if i ever get married ill certainly try to forget the fact

2173061 today ron paul demonstrated how deeply his message of freedom and limited government is resonating across the nation
2173062 ron paul has generated more grassroots excitement and support than any other candidate in the race
2173063 i dont see how any republican candidate can possibly win next year as being proponents of war and with the intention of spreading war into iran
2173064 yknow if i can just muster the faith to heal someone then ill know that im the son of god
2173065 if we would just spend a little time helping believers understand who they are we wouldnt have to spend so much time telling them what to do

2173135 all businesses need to consider business continuity but instances such as these are great examples of how certain sectors risk making huge in some cases crippling financial losses if they fail to realise the importance of implementing a bc system
2173136 this depends on what is meant by business continuity and also what you mean by smbs
2173137 obviously companies with 10 staff have very different needs from those with 500 although technically both are smbs
2173138 in addition to this applications such as exchange have become critical to the continued operation of many businesses as a result application that need some form of bc solution are more varied and more common across all businesses this has pushed business continuity higher on all businesses list of priorities than 10 years ago

2173210 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2173211 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2173212 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2173213 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2173214 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2173215 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2173216 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2173217 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2173218 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2173219 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2173220 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2173221 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2173222 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2173223 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2173224 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2173225 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2173226 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2173227 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2173228 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2173229 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2173230 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2173231 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2173232 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2173233 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2173234 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2173235 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2173236 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2173237 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2173238 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2173239 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2173240 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2173241 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2173242 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2173243 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2173244 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2173245 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2173246 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2173247 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2173248 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2173249 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2173250 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2173251 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2173252 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2173253 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2173254 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2173255 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2173256 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2173257 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2173258 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2173259 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2173260 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2173261 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2173262 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2173263 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2173264 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2173265 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2173266 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2173267 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2173268 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2173269 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2173270 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2173271 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2173272 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2173273 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2173274 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2173275 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2173276 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2173277 whoever like the following three things for him hell will be near to nerve of his neck
2173278 take me to that person so that i can see him
2173279 oh man the shroud and the grave has kept you away from the allah and these two things are disturbing on your way
2173280 safety is in loneliness the person who is single and alone and who do not think about others in his heart is safe and secured because it is not good to think about others in loneliness satan devil will run away when two persons meet each other
2173281 one who is content on this then he will not require any thing from the mankind
2173282 a man is successful one who wake up hungry and sleep hungry but he should not forget the remembrance allah in that condition
2173283 one person requested him to advice him and he told him
2173284 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2173285 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be praise for himself or there will be complain against allah
2173286 one who know allah then he should get lost himself permanently in the condition of surprise
2173287 allah will give respect to that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2173288 for the money we get and for this money we should see that it is coming from halal right source and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2173289 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the pleasure of allah then one should take care of it otherwise he will not be successful in the other world after the death
2173290 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things of the heaven
2173291 all things depend upon two things first thing that is made for us and other thing which is not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2173292 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2173293 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2173294 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2173295 due to his thinking his body become thin and bones are visible on his body
2173296 inspite of this condition he is enough for the insects in the grave
2173297 the prophet came into his dream and conveyed his message that he should not over look his duties towards her mother which is better than performing the hajj
2173298 he saw her two eyes and was fallen in her love
2173299 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of two angels who are writing mens good and bad deeds
2173300 once people saw him in the winter in one simple shirt and his body was with sweat
2173301 long time ago some guests were in his house who took some soil from the neghbours wall without the permission of the owner so from that time to up till now when ever i look on the wall i regret for the act of my guests and this is the reason of my sweat even though the neighbor already forgiven me for this mistake
2173302 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2173303 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2173304 oh otaiba be pity on your condition and he replied her
2173305 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2173306 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2173307 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i will not look at the world
2173308 once some body told him that many persons used to ask about your affairs
2173309 that person asked for the fresh dates and as there was no season of dates at that time but at the same time he gave him a bag full of dates to him
2173310 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2173311 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2173312 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his
2173313 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2173314 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2173315 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2173316 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2173317 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2173318 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2173319 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2173320 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2173321 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2173322 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2173323 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2173324 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2173325 it was reported that a fire worshipper once imprisoned him
2173326 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2173327 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2173328 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2173329 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2173330 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2173331 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2173332 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind
2173333 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2173334 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2173335 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2173336 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2173337 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2173338 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2173339 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2173340 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2173341 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him
2173342 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2173343 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2173344 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2173345 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2173346 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2173347 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2173348 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2173349 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2173350 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2173351 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2173352 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2173353 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2173354 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects
2173355 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2173356 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2173357 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2173358 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he died in the year 204 a h at the age of 54 years 19 th
2173359 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2173360 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2173361 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2173362 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2173363 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2173364 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2173365 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same
2173366 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2173367 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2173368 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2173369 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2173370 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2173371 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2173372 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from
2173373 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2173374 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2173375 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2173376 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2173377 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the private or public place and in both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2173378 he rewarded for raising one of his hand and if he raised the another one then we will have given the reward for that hand also
2173379 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2173380 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the weeping there were tears in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2173381 he thought caliph a bad man but he never told this to the people in this matter so that people may not think me sincere and truthful and for this i will leave this world in insincere condition
2173382 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2173383 some persons asked with saleh bin abdul karim which thing is good in the following
2173384 both are good but hopefulness is better than the fear
2173385 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep us away from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2173386 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and do not keep too much hopefulness for which you will be out of fear from the punishment
2173387 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2173388 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2173389 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2173390 if a man busy himself in the worship then in the meadows of heaven the angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2173391 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2173392 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say the meaning of humility which is as follows
2173393 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons were used to get cure but the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2173394 in the past in which the preachers think preaching a difficult task same like the persons of present time find difficulty to act upon the knowledge in the present time there is shortage of learned people like the shortage of preachers in the past
2173395 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy
2173396 awouze billah min shaitan nirjaim wa bilhaqe nazalna wa bilhaque nazal
2173397 so when i came back to him and explained him all the details which happened on the way
2173398 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2173399 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who are married in that world and suffered difficulties to maintain them
2173400 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2173401 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah
2173402 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2173403 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2173404 to day i will be free from the worldly grief and sorrow
2173405 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2173406 as he left over the worldly affairs so there is no such great learned person like him
2173407 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2173408 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2173409 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents and for telling this i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2173410 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2173411 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2173412 as per tradition of the prophet if some body get some thing without his desire then he should accept it otherwise it will be regarded as ungratefulness of allahs grace
2173413 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2173414 he acquired knowledge from abdals an order of saints for a period of 30 years and they advised me to keep away from the mankind and eat less
2173415 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2173416 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2173417 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2173418 oven is hot and so it will be done as per his order
2173419 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2173420 he is too much busy in the worship of allah so how he will look at them
2173421 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2173422 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2173423 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2173424 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time he used to eat in makkah
2173425 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2173426 you will not get mysticism because i have promised with allah that i will not put forward my hands toward haram illlegal things
2173427 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2173428 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today
2173429 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2173430 what is your opinion about revelation and miracles of your disciples
2173431 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2173432 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2173433 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2173434 one person invited him but he did not accepted his invitation and for this punishment he did not ate any thing for fourteen days
2173435 a true person is one who feels pleasure of action before action is done sincerity is an action in which there is pleasure of worship
2173436 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval and so allah can keep me in any condition what ever he likes
2173437 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2173438 my bravery demands me to wear the dress of mysticism and follow their ways the bravery which require from you is to take down the dress of mysticism and in this way by remembrance of allah you can attain good position so that the world may not attract you
2173439 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2173440 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2173441 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2173442 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2173443 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2173444 he should not be angry with any body for the sake of matters of the world
2173445 the meaning of zahed mysticism is to be content for what ever one gets and do not desire more than that
2173446 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2173447 he will widen the means for his wisdom and sagacity as he respected his name
2173448 first he wanted to be free andsecond may allah grant repentance for his master and third he should get reward for the helping the darwesh person so he may get returned back his four dirhams
2173449 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that meeting and mansur amer
2173450 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2173451 oh the people of faith protect yourself your family members and your sole from the fire of hell
2173452 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2173453 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2173454 the heart of mystic saint is the center of remembrance of allah
2173455 the heart is source of light and if the desire of the world enters into ones heart then that light will finish in him and darkness will cover it
2173456 allah blessed him and asked him to do praise and eulogy for him in presence of angels same as he used to praise and eulogy for him in the other world
2173457 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2173458 prophet younus pbuh thought that allah will not be angry with him but for him allah sent a great difficulty on him
2173459 to have faith in allahto be away from the mankindto speak sincerelyto bear the hardships of endurance for the right way
2173460 belief is the gift of light of allah with which one can observe the affairs of the next world as there will be no curtains for him
2173461 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers than wealth and children
2173462 due to the blessing of allah man got the following four things
2173463 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is good for the next world
2173464 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless
2173465 the best desire is that which will solve our problems
2173466 those who leave the sins and then they can hope from allah for his grace
2173467 if you want to become more important than others so for this thing leave every thing and then you can keep trust in allah so that you can see all others standing in need of you
2173468 we have created jinn and human beings for my worship
2173469 to sacrifice the life for the sake of allah and if you can not do this then leave to act upon the sayings of the mystic persons
2173470 he was regret to know that you had sold away your religion for the value of two particles of gold because at the time purchasing some thing from some body you told him the price five times less to the salesman which the owner of the shop told you and due to your status of dignity the salesman believed your statement and sold away the thing at the lesser price
2173471 to learn quran for worldly gains is not useful and it is very bad thing
2173472 the truthful worship of one night is better than the incursion
2173473 you are a slave so for the slave there will be no comfort at all availabe to him
2173474 during the worship pray with more attention and take care so that you can get the benefit from it
2173475 you got your punishment of your thought and if you thought more than this then you will get more punishment than this
2173476 for a period of 13 years as per his thinking as an abstinent he had performed hajs but upon his re thinking he find all his hajs were based upon the psychological desires because once my mother told me to bring the water pot and that order was unpleasant for me so i think all my hajs were not free from the psychological desires
2173477 as you looked other than us so we had taken back your dress of pious persons if you do this mistake again then we will also take back your dress of the innermost
2173478 here i find the recitation of quran and the worship style which is not as per my standard
2173479 say if it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred the wealth that ye have gained the commerce in which ye fear a decline or the dwellings in which ye delight
2173480 quran 9 24 the signs of love of allah are as follows revelations miracles piety he met many great pious personalities of his time he left his native place busanji and lived in
2173481 i know well that you did not stolen my donkey but i know also that allah will accept your prayers and will not accept my prayers so i caused you trouble for it
2173482 i do not blame you for this act and this is not from you and i think allah will not commit mistakes
2173483 he is kidher for which you were eager to meet with me
2173484 then the boy due to the fear of allah died suddenly
2173485 how sad this thing is that the boy died due to the fear of one verse upon its reading but there was no effect upon me as i am reading the holy quran since many years
2173486 due to the fear of allah he will not stay in the mosque for the longer time after his regular prayers
2173487 the shortage of wealth is useful in the both worlds and its increase is harmful in the both worlds
2173488 the position of humility because i do not have strength to bear such difficulties of the prophets
2173489 i can convert a muslim to disbeliever within seconds and for this i will make him greedy of harm illegal things and prevalence of desires in him and then he will commits sins and after that i will put into him misgiving of the disbelief
2173490 the man was created by many things but two items of water and soil are more in him
2173491 in the water many colors and tastes are there and for this reason it is difficult for us to know its taste
2173492 we have given life to all things by the water
2173493 the best indigent person is one from whom the kings could not ask the revenue and on the day of judgment allah will not ask for his accountability
2173494 abu ali you always think for yourself and you did not think for others
2173495 you asked me to recite kalima but i swear in the name of grace of allah that in between us nothing is there except his dignity and by saying this he left this world
2173496 we had sent the tiger for you so by holding the tigers legs you should come out of the well

2173536 orang itu mencuri adakah kerja kita nak buat hudud potong tangan dia saja
2173537 apabila hukum rejam dengan batu sampai mati kepada penzina dan potong tangan kepada pencuri nescaya ramailah rakyat islam yang mati dan kudung tangan ini sangat memalukan umat islam kerana orang bukan islam akan sempurna sifatnya dan boleh meneruskan kerja
2173538 kerajaan kelantan harus dipertanggungjawab jika berlaku huru hara ketidakstabilan politik perpecahan dikalangan umat islam dan kegelisahan rakyat apabila hukum hudud dilaksanakan di negeri itu rakyat harus menyoal perlaksanaan hukum itu menguntungkan atau menyebabkan perpecahan pertentangan dan ketidakstabikan politik tidak semua negara islam mengamalkan hukum hudud bahkan ada negara islam lebih makmur tanpa hukum itu
2173539 bagaimana kita boleh maju kalau orang islam sudah tidak ada tangan dan kaki bagaimana mereka mahu bersaing dengan bangsa bangsa lain kalau sifatnya sudah tidak cukup hukum hudud tidak sesuai dilakukan di negara ini yang mempunyai rakyat berbilang kaum dan agama
2173540 kalau hukum potong tangan dilaksanakan maka macam mana mereka hendak bekerja untuk menyara keluarga mereka nanti kan lebih baik mereka diberi kerja dari potong tangan mereka

2173553 gardiner threw in his lot with the wrong crew of shitheads he made the wrong friends see they elect the board every two years he got his information wrong and sided with the wrong team now that this crew is in they want him out

2173600 barely three years after he was pictured in the press with loyal wife and kids
2173601 a month after he broke down on the steps of the adelaide court
2173602 i would like to talk to you about a few students and their report cards
2173603 jane wants me to talk to all of the parents of students who are failing today so that i can phone parents
2173604 so first of all i am curious as to why over half of your students are failing
2173605 because they are chronically lazy and dont do any work its pretty simple actually
2173606 well i think that it is strange that only one or two of these kids are failing in other classes yours is the class by far with the most failures in all of middle school
2173607 i guess ill just have to tell elaine that you dont want to cooperate
2173608 hi buddy nice to know that i have screwed u before my appearance
2173609 jungle jungle baat chali hai pata chala hai chaddi pehan ke phool khila hai
2173610 look at that guys pants they look like they were quilted
2173611 who these people are is not important what they do and what they know is
2173612 id also point out that what the media says is of little consequence in comparison to what the science says and science is not a matter of opinion but of research testing analysis and deduction

2173625 that manager tried to pull a real dick move by making me clean the bathrooms which i didnt
2173626 only me is not enough everyone is making it worse so whats the point to do it
2173627 we didnt really love each other yet instead there was a mental commitment between us a realization that we were accepting each other as husband and wife totally and for always in a way i realized that bond was stronger than love though i certainly did not and do not want to be seen as an advocate of arranged marriages i realized there was something to a relationship based on acceptance we were coming into our marriage with no preconceptions no expectations of each other than good will and respect in love marriages i imagined the expectations were so high they were bound to be somewhat dashed
2173628 i fetched my wife home u dun believe u go ask her

2173634 i dont want to do it again i hate moving to move again is almost like uh no
2173635 its the old clich that growth in phoenix is like automobiles in detroit its the major industry
2173636 if you want to build a tract house then there are five or six of the best outfits in the world here
2173637 a real good assembly line manufacturing process the builders here are big builders and they can put a lot of homes down in a fast way
2173638 a steady flow of production everybody has web sites where they can log on and see where theyre supposed to be when
2173639 were taking a fresh look at it theres really an opportunity out here to do things differently
2173640 if we had everybody who was living out here driving into phoenix every day
2173641 you couldnt sustain the pace that was happening a year ago the price increases the rising land costs the housing costs it was driving people out of the market now were getting back to what the phoenix market really was
2173642 we think theres demand for maybe 45 000 single family units a year
2173643 its like ok youve gotta trust me this is going to be great
2173644 property is subject to assessments imposed by the central arizona water conservation district cawcd for membership in the central arizona groundwater replenishment district cagrd the cagrd costs will be a part of the annual property tax billing from the county treasurer a lot purchasers share of the costs will depend on the amount of water used
2173645 theres nuances but it will at least outlast my mortgage and you need that to protect your property values
2173646 when they sign their name to the title of that house they are taking on the responsibility of paying for whatever it costs to get that water supply replenished
2173647 i gotta be honest with you this year looks like a record year
2173648 unlike los angeles the area has enough water from underground rivers aqueducts and nearby mountains to support all the new residents
2173649 what people are basically saying is well take the 1 3 million acre feet on the river and well just carve it up
2173650 i think the indian communities will be the opec of the southwest
2173651 weve always been talking about competing demands for a limited water supply weve always been planning for it and now out in the west valley theres all these houses going up and it kind of became visible
2173652 weve got to be involved because you never know where the next source is and we want to make sure were protecting our sources today
2173653 an issue that we as a state have to get figured out
2173654 whatever the political process decides well try to make it work
2173655 they say there is no limit because we can get californias 4 4 million acre feet share of the colorado river by building them desalination plants well build desalination plants on the coast to get them water and well take their water in exchange and well build our third cap canal
2173656 pretty soon youve got a huge war chest of money
2173657 of all the megapolitan regions that are emerging this is the newest and this is the smallest
2173658 theres going to be some limit to the carrying capacity of this region
2173659 air quality might be what kills the goose that laid the golden egg
2173660 make a bit of difference if people say yeah phoenix thats like mexico city in the 80s
2173661 i would say in the next two years itll be just exactly the same
2173662 if you think its gonna be a workable situation if all these red dots are isolated individuals
2173663 once youre aware of these things its all about figuring out solutions
2173664 we need to know what is going into the aquifer
2173665 it is protecting everyone irrigators sportsmen it is providing for responsible groundwater use
2173666 it comes down to how many straws you have in the ground
2173667 its much better to be proactive and protect the resource
2173668 the issue is whether youre using groundwater faster than youre renewing it
2173669 jefferson county is more advanced than others in studying the groundwater and looking at letting growth be determined by that
2173670 science went out the window when this went to the planning commission
2173671 we agree that its an important issue but we just cant agree on the approach
2173672 its so obvious that as the population increases we must find alternative sources of water
2173673 if we dont do that we will have havoc in the economy and not have orderly development
2173674 this is to the detriment of the county and will mean more work for us
2173675 i used to create my own player and try to make it look as much like me as possible
2173676 when i was a little kid everybody could do the same dunks and lay ups
2173677 i remember last year the game version of me was doing the same hand gestures i do
2173678 as a youngster i never pictured myself being in a video game
2173679 one of my favorite game players growing up was terrell davis in the madden games
2173680 davis never looked like he was running that fast yet no one could catch him our running styles are similar
2173681 games are relaxing its pure entertainment this is the way you kill four five hours
2173682 you have your boys over you have your kids over and you have a big tournament we might have three tvs going
2173683 i played ea sports mvp baseball 2004 all summer long and rasheed marshall and i played mariokart on ninetendo gamecube for a week straight
2173684 i could play games like that all day 10 straight
2173685 video games can be a positive influence for younger kids who might not have started skating yet
2173686 if you get into the realism of the video games kids might try street hockey and eventually graduate to the rink
2173687 its tough to replicate the battles along the boards in video games
2173688 but if kids dont know anything about hockey video games are fun to play because its up and down action and scoring goals
2173689 thats precisely what i am doing by reading this article
2173690 its up to you how much you really want it do you really believe in it it shows
2173691 when you look for some information how do you do to get your information needed
2173692 see it isnt easy to hit those notes is it i didnt hear too many of them

2173694 oh youll have to speak up a bit louder the next time im a trifle deaf in this ear
2173695 well i always tell my daughter that my favourite animal is a giraffe but that isnt true laughs i dont know why i told her that but i guess it is probably a she either said groundhog or hedgehog i cant remember i was too busy laughing
2173696 weve been here a few times before but i dont remember you guys being so funny

2173711 what really bemused me was that one of the flautists i shant say who for fear of being murdered was tapping her feet and shaking her body to the beat throughout the concert

2173719 this will help us purchase the new computer we plan to use in our house
2173720 god is this a regulation shot this is lasting longer than i anticipated
2173721 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2173722 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2173723 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
2173724 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
2173725 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
2173726 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
2173727 this being a national process there is no way the trc can give an accurate account of aggrieved happenings without hearing from the people themselves we need those stories to enable us do our job
2173728 we have begun talking with some in question and they have assured the commission of their willingness and prepareness when needed to deal with the trc
2173729 i think the only thing it can do to be successful is to go about preaching peace in all parts of liberia
2173730 i figured things would be different but instead im stuck working at a job below my level of potential
2173731 the first 10 seconds of the interview is the most important part most people who my colleagues and i have added on to our staff make great first impressions proper traditional work attire is always mandatory for my taste even though we tell people to dress casual going the extra distance with a dress shirt and tie goes a long way professionalism is something we look for in all our workers

2173788 hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
2173789 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
2173790 if we were to say that god predetermined that adam sinned then we would have to say that god caused sin i would have to say that would be blaspheme god gave man the will to do freely as he willed adam chose sin just as each everyone else does sin sends man to hell

2173797 its better to be paranoid and prepared and have nothing happen than to not be prepared and something does happen
2173798 i assume what is meant is an oblique reference to some sort of systematized in which privileged white offspring descend into the depths of savagery to sprinkle hope and salvation to the poor and oppressed paternalist perhaps but not colonialist

2173805 ill be the one whos different ill show them respect and theyll respect me for it theyll want to please me because im the first person whos ever smiled at them and shown i care
2173806 during summer school youll be told to manage your classroom in a way that seems dehumanizing and demeaning do it
2173807 your students in your classrooms come from families that are chaotic and tragic beyond your wildest imagination
2173808 examine the ideas of rules rewards and consequences before you dismiss them outright as unnecessarily harsh and or demeaning
2173809 ill be the one whos different ill show them respect and theyll respect me for it theyll want to please me because im the first person whos ever smiled at them and shown i care
2173810 they need to know responsibility organization dedication and that if they work and try hard enough theres a better life for them out there
2173811 we have a lot of potential but not the chance to show it
2173812 when parents say that sports is sinful for girls it really upsets me because theyre depriving their daughters of something thats very good for them

2173815 because true conservatives are pessimists they are happier than liberals for three reasons first pessimists are rarely surprised second when they are wrong they are delighted to be so third pessimists do not put their faith in princes in government they understand that happiness is a function of fending for oneself happiness is an activity it is inseparable from the pursuit of happiness

2173819 may the god of peace who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep
2173820 john 6 39 we can conclude from this that god had in mind a certain people whom would be his elect since god knows all things he knows those whom he has chosen hence they are predestined from the very beginning of time
2173821 eph 2 3 this is not to say that we are as evil as we can be rather that all of what we are is affected by sin
2173822 out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks
2173823 mark 7 21 23 it follows then that mans understanding reflection feelings and experiences are all stained by sin
2173824 for when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness
2173825 eph 2 15 enmity is hatred bitterness and malice toward an enemy that was our relationship to god prior to salvation there was enmity between us
2173826 with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible
2173827 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him
2173828 for though the twins had not done anything good or bad in order that gods purpose according to his choice might stand not because of works but because of him who calls it was said to her the older will serve the younger just as it is written jacob i loved but esau i hated
2173829 rom 9 15 16 18 this is sovereignty it is god who is in control
2173830 for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word and to this doom they were also appointed
2173831 what if god although willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction and he did so in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy which he prepared beforehand for glory
2173832 rom 9 22 23 it seems quite clear that god prepares some for mercy and not others that is sovereignty
2173833 for whom he foreknew he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren and whom he predestined these he also called
2173834 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
2173835 i do not speak of all of you i know the ones i have chosen
2173836 but now that you have come to know god or rather to be known by him
2173837 it is obvious from this verse that the ones who believe are the ones who are appointed by god to believe
2173838 god grants that the elect believe that is why we are born again not of our wills but of the will of god john 1 12 13
2173839 for christs love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died
2173840 jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent
2173841 i probably wont be able to paint as much as i used to but ill still do some of the things i like the best
2173842 still do some of the things you like the best
2173843 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned

2173850 this was a watershed moment in the history of humankind
2173851 when you make a choice to lay down your life sometimes freight trains run over you i dont know my brain is fried and my heart is torn and ministry all seems messy today
2173852 times changed underlying philosophies shifted and so we all must adapt but sometimes it feels like we are under attack for remaining as faithful as we know how if a true dialogue is going to take place there must be a freedom from condemnation on both sides
2173853 have i not created all this long before you and these issues you wrestle with i formed these cliffs from the waters themselves they have been here thousands of years be still and know that i am god
2173854 hee hee hee you know i like you fairy boy youre really my type
2173855 if youre standing on the railroad track and the train is bearing down on you at 90 miles per hour dont stand there trying to decide whether the oncoming train is the midnight special or the wabash cannon ball just get the hell off the tracks which train was coming at you can be determined later right now thats not the problem
2173856 take substantive additional action as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks
2173857 us business confidence fell to a new record low at the start of 2008 and is consistent with recession sentiment is stronger elsewhere across the globe particularly in asia although it is down everywhere since the subprime financial shock began this past summer expectations regarding the first half of 2008 are especially bleak plunging to another new low last week businesses have also become notably cautious with respect to their inventories and office space needs hiring and fixed investment are soft but holding up better pricing pressures have risen with oil prices near 100 per barrel but remain very subdued compared to the pressures that prevailed during previous oil price spurts
2173858 the surge in oil prices toward the us 100 threshold adds to growth risks for many of the worlds economies
2173859 while strong oil demand especially in china and the middle east is contributing to the surge in crude prices the rising world oil bill is bearish for global growth this tax on growth adds to pressure for major central banks to ease monetary policy while rising oil prices have temporarily push up headline inflation the impact of crude on price pressures may already be peaking bottom line high oil prices will require more aggressive stimulus from policymakers in order to support economic growth
2173860 the us has entered its first full blown economic recession in 16 years according to investment bank merrill lynch merrill itself one of wall streets biggest casualties of the sub prime crisis is the first major bank to declare that a recession in the worlds biggest economy is now underway
2173861 david rosenberg the banks chief north american economist argues that a weakening employment picture and declining retail sales signal the economy has tipped into its first month of recession
2173862 his comments are the strongest sign yet that the gloom on wall street over the us economy is deepening as the sub prime mortgage crisis and the credit rout show little sign of easing
2173863 mr rosenberg points to a whole batch of negative data to support his analysis including the four key barometers used by the national bureau of economic research nebr employment real personal income industrial production and real sales activity in retail and manufacturing
2173864 it appears to have powers to support the markets in a crisis with a host of instruments mostly by through buying futures contracts on the stock indexes and key credit levers and it has the means to fry short traders in the hottest of oils
2173865 the team is led by treasury chief hank paulson ex goldman sachs a man with a nose for market psychology and includes fed chairman ben bernanke and the key exchange regulators
2173866 judging by a well briefed report in the washington post a mood of deep alarm has taken hold in the upper echelons of the administration
2173867 in terms of any stimulus package were considering all options said mr bush this should be interesting to watch the president is not one for half measures he has already shown in iraq and on biofuels that he will pursue policies a loutrance once he gets the bit between his teeth
2173868 chairman bernanke was crystal clear about the near term direction of monetary policy when he concluded his remarks with the following
2173869 these transparent comments have raised the probability of a 50 bps cut in the federal funds on january 30 to a nearly certain situation and movements in the federal funds futures market reflect this scenario
2173870 a sputtering job market has convinced economists at key us investment banks that the federal reserve will need to resort to a steeper half percentage point interest rate cut when it meets later this month
2173871 goldman sees three further rate cuts after january of 25 basis points each bringing the fed funds rate to 3
2173872 the fed already has cut the fed funds rate by a full percentage point since mid september as policy makers aimed to soften the blow to the us economy of a slumping housing sector and a global tightening of credit conditions
2173873 northern trust chief economist paul kasriel recalling the seinfeld festivus episode airs some grievances in his latest commentary particularly noting the ridiculous valuations houses have in relation to consumer income between 1980 and 2000 the price of a house averaged about 337 of consumer income but that rose to 469 in the 2000 2006 period in order to reestablish the old equilibrium he notes that housing prices would need to fall 22 but the median price of an existing home has not declined on a year over year basis between 1968 to 2006 so we are in uncharted waters here he writes
2173874 the risk of companies defaulting rose the most in more than two months this week after us reports showing a slowdown in jobs growth and manufacturing stoked concern that the economy will sink into a recession
2173875 defaults may rise almost seven fold to 2 25 percent this year analysts at new york based jpmorgan chase amp co the biggest underwriter of high yield high risk corporate bonds last year said in a report yesterday
2173876 the us economy is very close to recession if not there already bill gross who manages the worlds largest bond fund as pimcos chief investment officer said in an interview on bloomberg television
2173877 two of the biggest names on wall street are going hat in hand again to foreign investors
2173878 merrill is expected to get 3 billion to 4 billion much of it from a middle eastern government investment fund citi could get as much as 10 billion likely all from foreign governments
2173879 such large investments would be the latest sign big banks are undergoing a rapid recapitalization to stabilize their shaky financial foundations already foreign governments have invested about 27 billion in merrill citi ubs and morgan stanley
2173880 both citi and merrill are scrambling to nail down the details before they report earnings next week that are expected to include additional losses stemming from their exposure to mortgage related investments together these additional losses could reach as much as 25 billion
2173881 our view is that the current financial imbroglio is so massive that too big to fail will become too big to bail there is no conceivable way to bailout entities that might entail trillions of dollars
2173882 the us is at risk of losing its top notch triple a credit rating within a decade unless it takes radical action to curb soaring healthcare and social security spending moodys the credit rating agency said on thursday january 10 2008
2173883 the warning over the future of the triple a rating granted to us government debt since it was first assessed in 1917 reflects growing concerns over the countrys ability to retain its financial and economic supremacy
2173884 most analysts expect future governments to deal with the costs of healthcare and social security and there is no reflection of any long term concern about the us financial health in the value of its debt
2173885 but moodys warning comes at a time when us confidence in its economic prowess has been challenged by the rising threat of a recession a weak dollar and the credit crunch
2173886 the stock market is oversold short term which invites the potential for a spectacular clearing rally of the typical variety fast furious and prone to failure
2173887 the expectation of oncoming recession may be gaining some amount of sponsorship but it is still far from the consensus view and is therefore most probably far from being fully discounted in stock prices
2173888 though p e multiples have come down a bit they are still very rich on the basis of normalized profit margins
2173889 on the issue of whether the recent correction removes any further potential for market weakness jim stack of investech notes that prolonged correction less periods have generally been resolved by much deeper losses than 10 at 55 months the period since 2003 has been the second longest stretch in 80 years without a 10 correction the record was the 84 month period during the 1990s though that instance ultimately led to a series of 10 18 corrections between 1997 and 2000 before the market finally dropped in half the other most prolonged periods 40 months from oct 1962 feb 1966 and 37 months from jul 1984 aug 1987 were followed immediately by full bear markets
2173890 the operative thesis for investors at this time is that the primary trend has turned down
2173891 i dont know how far this bear market is fated to carry
2173892 through over half a century of experience ive learned to respect bear markets i dont trade them i dont fade them i dont short them i stay out of them ive learned to stay on the sidelines
2173893 s amp p 500 q3 y y earnings growth declined 4 3 expectations were 4 at the beginning of q3 this is the lowest quarterly growth rate for the s amp p 500 since q1 2002
2173894 what is astounding about the s amp p 500 earnings decline is that its with 4 9 gdp growth obviously something is not kosher with that gdp number and what will happen to earnings in a recession
2173895 anyone who has been paying a lick of attention to the world at large should be rightfully concerned about the health of their financial portfolios
2173896 for anyone who has any industry experience in the mortgage markets or leveraged finance this correspondent included its quite clear that the excesses of the past several years will take significant time to work off and will strongly impact the real economy in the process
2173897 while there are certainly some bears rumbling at the periphery much of the wall street selling machine continues to call for double digit gains in 2008 often touting the markets relatively undervalued p e ratio
2173898 investment bank economists also continue to tout the underlying strength of the domestic economy but economics isnt called the dismal science without reason while economic common sense is immensely valuable in explaining how and why individuals and firms make rational business decisions many economic prognosticators have a woeful track record in predicting future events given that the entire field is often predicated on the usage of backward looking indicators and data rather than common sense future observations predictions this isnt terribly surprising
2173899 a better way to think of gold may be as central bankers used to before america dropped the gold standard not as a commodity but as another currency as long as the dollar stays weak golds bull run will last
2173900 the arguments for further gains in the gold price are compelling it looks cheap despite climbing from a low of about 250 a troy ounce in 1999 when central banks were selling reserves the uks decision back then to sell 60 per cent of its official holdings looks particularly poor judgment
2173901 but it is the relationship between the dollar and the reaction of the worlds central banks to the credit squeeze that some bulls would say really makes gold an attractive bet
2173902 the worlds major economies have experienced rapid money supply growth of 10 per cent plus per annum in recent years
2173903 moreover a sharp decline in us real interest rates financial markets expect another half percentage point cut this month means that the low yield on gold matters less it may have been a poor hedge against inflation in the past but the combination of rising consumer prices and economic stagnation may make it a better store of value
2173904 what can i buy today at 1979 1980 prices russell youve got to be kidding everything is much more expensive today forget those prices of 1979 1980 get into reality man
2173905 wait there is one thing that i can buy today at around 1979 1980 prices
2173906 hey russell does that mean that gold is a bargain my answer is that i dont think of gold in terms of it being bargain priced i simply think of it as real money that is catching up to the times i cant buy the dow at its 1980 price of 850 hardly the dow is selling at 14 times its 1980 prices well then how is it that gold is still under 900 thats a long story but lets just say that i really dont know i do know that gold is underpriced compared with almost anything else so yeah when i think about it yes gold is a bargain and i like bargains particularly when the bargain happens to be real money
2173907 my only concern at the moment is that everyone is talking about gold including bullish forecasts aplenty i think they are right but sentiment is often a contrary indicator so golds advance may pause for a while
2173908 in precious metals the market climate appears extremely favorable featuring downward yield trends upward inflation trends and in combination a very hostile environment for the us dollar economic weakness evidenced by a weak ism purchasing managers index among other factors and a gold xau ratio that is well above 4 this combination of conditions has historically generated an unusually strong return risk profile for precious metals shares
2173909 gold has been an exceptional play having risen 36 since mid august
2173910 indeed when it seems like things cannot get any better they often do not and for example if china were to really liberalize its capital markets gold prices could lose a lot of steam however until something significant knocks off this surge in demand it is hard to see gold retreating
2173911 a new crisis is emerging a global food catastrophe that will reach further and be more crippling than anything the world has ever seen
2173912 its not a matter of if but when he warned investors its going to hit this year hard
2173913 mr coxe said the sharp rise in raw food prices in the past year will intensify in the next few years amid increased demand for meat and dairy products from the growing middle classes of countries such as china and india as well as heavy demand from the biofuels industry
2173914 the greatest challenge to the world is not us 100 oil its getting enough food so that the new middle class can eat the way our middle class does and that means weve got to expand food output dramatically he said
2173915 the peoples bank of china may at last be substantially revaluing its currency even if officially it has told no one
2173916 the changes this month alone would see a 15 16 hike on an annualised basis and markets are starting to estimate that the gain may be as much as 9 over the year that would bring the total change since the government abandoned the fixed peg in july 2005 to nearly 20
2173917 the move may have striking repercussions for a global economy in which chinas currency policies have often come under fire for creating liquidity imbalances but which is now also fighting the threat of higher prices
2173918 most analysts say fear of domestic inflation is the prime reason for a policy change the consumer prices index rose 6 9 in november up from 6 5 despite government hopes that inflation had peaked it blamed big rises in food prices but there are also signs that inflation is creeping into the wider economy
2173919 i have often referred to china and india as the king and queen of emerging markets for their current and especially long term growth potential
2173920 my view is that chinas and indias stock markets will inevitably be volatile from time to for all the usual reasons but remain extremely attractive for the long term i have no intention of reducing my holdings in these markets but have often said that i prefer to buy following setbacks currently of the two this only applies to china
2173921 goldman sachs cut its economic growth estimate for japan and said theres a 50 chance of a recession in the worlds second largest economy
2173922 the probability of a recession in japan has risen to the danger level tetsufumi yamakawa chief japan economist at goldman said in a report to clients today we project weaker than expected growth in japan
2173923 the nations economy will continue to slow for the time being bank of japan deputy governor toshiro muto said today
2173924 yamakawa cut his 2008 growth estimate to 1 percent from 1 2 percent citing slower demand from emerging markets sluggish spending by consumers has left japan more dependant on overseas markets just as cooling us demand threatens to spread to asia where japan sells half its exports

2173926 export growth is slowing business activity and sentiment measures have eroded markedly and our industrial production model warns of a sharp deceleration in the coming months
2173927 the ecb will be slow to ease but below trend growth should erode inflation pressures in the coming months and help alleviate concerns of policymakers opening the door to rate cuts by the end of the first half of 2008
2173928 today it seems the cracks are finally starting to show in europe
2173929 what is perhaps even more telling is the fact that european retail sales have already started to falter
2173930 we are now evermore convinced that europe is heading for recession and to make matters worse europe does not excel at making the necessary adjustments at such transition points in the business cycle
2173931 all in all we see troubling times ahead for european markets
2173932 growth in the average house price as calculated from the mortgage portfolio of hbos rose 1 3 seasonally adjusted in december though on a year ago basis price growth slipped to 5 2 the monthly figures represent the first positive rate of month ago growth since august when prices grew 0 3 in that month the year ago rate stood at 11 4 overall the data continue to point to a softening in house price growth in the uk and follow a downwardly revised contraction of 1 3 m m in november

2173969 the stock market started the year with another bearish fall a lousy stock market in 2007 will look good compared to an awful stock market in 2008
2173970 a harbinger of a sizable correction or a bear market in the coming year
2173971 if santa claus should fail to call bears may come to broad amp wall
2173972 i think that we are in a recession for most of the first half of this year and that we begin a slow recovery in the second half it will be a muddle through economy for at least another year after that that would suggest that most companies will come under serious earnings pressure if history is any indicator that means we should see a bear market in the first half of this year how deep will depend on how fast the fed cuts but i dont think we are looking at anything close to the bear market of 2000 2001 still i wouldnt want to stand in front of a bear market train
2173973 the credit bubble is just beginning to unwind and while us borrowers are being blamed for the mess they were really just a pawn in a global game
2173974 emerging stock markets are definitely to be avoided he adds following their significant out performance over the last few years
2173975 in fabers opinion the gold bull market will come to an end when sovereign wealth funds sick and tired of their investments in financial stocks will finally purchase gold probably at above 3 000 per ounce
2173976 question russell youve been talking about a third phase to the stock market where are you now on this subject
2173977 answer as you know im guided at all times by the action of the stock market itself when the market doesnt agree with me i stop revise my thinking and get in harmony with the market which is what ive been doing over recent weeks
2173978 something has interrupted the major rising trend of the market
2173979 but i do know one thing the primary trend the great tide of the stock market appears to be in the process of turning down
2173980 the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5 0 in december from 4 7 in november the december reading is the highest since september 2005 the jobless rate has now risen from a cycle low of 4 4 in march 2007 the increase in the unemployment rate reflects a widespread loss of jobs historically sharp increases in the unemployment rate are associated with recessions
2173981 payroll employment rose only 18 000 in december the smallest gain since august 2003 revisions to october and november payroll estimates show a net gain of 10 000 jobs private sector payroll employment fell 13 000 in december the first monthly record of private sector job losses since july 2003 total payroll employment increases averaged 111 000 per month in 2007 versus a 189 000 per month in 2006 on a year to year basis total payroll employment slowed to a 0 9 gain down from a peak growth rate of 2 14 in march 2006 household survey data also show a similar decelerating trend in hiring
2173982 manufacturing activity contracted in december with the ism index falling 3 1 points to 47 7 this marks the sixth consecutive decline in the index the last time this occurred was between 2000 and 2001 also the latest decline puts the ism below its expansionary threshold of 50 for the first time since january with business confidence fragile and uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook growing it is clear that manufacturers are letting final demand set the pace of production todays report provides additional support for further fed easing
2173983 mortgage demand decreased 11 6 in the week ending december 28 purchase applications decreased 8 5 and refinance applications decreased 15 4 another week of declining activity suggests improving conditions in the nations housing market are still not in sight
2173984 us house prices would have to fall considerably to return to a normal relationship with rents says a study by one former and two current federal reserve economists
2173985 the study tracks rents and home prices back to 1960 and found annual rents fluctuated at around 5 to 5
2173986 that means the rent price ratio is about a third below its long term average to return to normal would require some combination of falling prices and rising rents the paper suggests house prices would need to fall about 3 a year if rents grew in line with their 4 average annual growth this decade
2173987 as expected a us recession is now unavoidable the combination of the worst housing recession ever getting worse a severe liquidity and credit crunch being worse now than in august oil close to 100 capex spending by the corporate sector falling for four months now commercial real estate being in serious trouble the labor market beginning its slack as initial claims and continuing claims are surging and a shopped out saving less and debt burdened consumer having stopped its shopping spree this holiday season will all lead to a severe rather than mild recession in 2008
2173988 according to bill gross this recession may have already started in december 2007 when eventually the nber business cycle dating committee will date in the next 12 months the peak of this business cycle december 2007 may indeed end up being the beginning of this recession or at the latest q1 of 2008
2173989 the december employment report confirms expectations of further easing of monetary policy a 25 basis point cut in the federal funds rate to 4 00 on january 30 is nearly certain a more aggressive 50 basis point cut is an even bet in our view
2173990 the ism manufacturing survey indicates a contracting factory sector to go along with a contracting housing sector
2173991 the nature of recent economic reports has raised the probability of a recession the fomc voting member hawks philadelphia fed president plosser and dallas fed president fisher will try to limit the reduction in the fed funds target to only 25 basis points by arguing that the past years run up in food and energy prices and the run down in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are clear and present inflation dangers however fomc voting member doves might counter with the argument that inflation is a lagging economic process and that a severe recession is the clearer and more present danger
2173992 president george w bush will meet with secretary henry paulson and federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke tomorrow as he considers whether to announce a new economic stimulus package amid slowing growth
2173993 bush will speak to reporters tomorrow after a 1 p m meeting at the white house with members of the presidents working group on financial markets press secretary dana perino said today
2173994 it will be a number of weeks before the president makes a decision on a stimulus package white house spokesman tony fratto said
2173995 the meeting tomorrow will come hours after the labor departments december employment figures which economists anticipate will show a weaker pace of job gains and higher unemployment reports in the past week showed a contraction in manufacturing and the weakest new home sales in 12 years
2173996 the administration will do what we think is appropriate to continue to foster economic growth ed gillespie senior counselor to the president told reporters jan
2173997 global business sentiment ended 2007 weak and fragile it fell sharply with last summers subprime financial shock and has never recovered us businesses are particularly on edge american confidence is consistent with a contracting economy expectations regarding the first half of 2008 are especially bleak falling to a record low last week on a 4 week moving average basis pricing pressures have risen with oil prices near 100 per barrel but remain very subdued compared to the pressures that prevailed during previous oil price spurts
2173998 ben s bernanke mervyn king and fellow central bankers may go on filling up the world economys punch bowl in 2008 even at the risk of an inflationary hangover
2173999 signs that the party is ending for global growth are keeping monetary policy leaning in the same direction at major central banks with those in the uk and canada likely to join bernankes federal reserve in cutting interest rates again
2174000 i expect 2008 to mark the beginning of another global liquidity cycle says joachim fels morgan stanleys london based co chief economist
2174001 signs have been mounting of a slowdown in britains property market so what are the prospects for 2008
2174002 a total 1 4 million people will see their fixed rate mortgage deal end in the early part of next year and each will be forced to pay an average of 200 pounds per month more to meet the cost of servicing their home loans
2174003 tighter lending conditions could add pain to consumers already mortgaged to the hilt outstanding housing debt stands at more than a trillion pounds and household finances look set to be stretched further by rising food and energy costs as wages fail to keep pace with inflation
2174004 house prices have risen 179 percent over the past 10 years from an average price of 70 000 pounds in late 1997
2174005 the surging price of oil from just over 10 a barrel a decade ago to 100 yesterday is altering the wealth and influence of nations and industries around the world
2174006 the long oil price boom is posing wrenching challenges for the worlds poorest nations while enriching and emboldening producers in the middle east russia and venezuela
2174007 no one can say for sure whether sky high oil part of a price boom in a wide range of commodities from gold to wheat is here to stay
2174008 the arrival of 100 a barrel oil adds to the pressure on the us economy which has sustained a big blow from a drop in housing prices and a wave of foreclosures even at todays prices though the oil spike alone isnt enough to push the world into recession economists say
2174009 gold has soared through resistance to touch an all time high of 861 20 an ounce in new york surpassing the record last seen at the height of the inflation crisis in 1980
2174010 bulls seized the initiative as oil spiked briefly to 100 a barrel and the dollar buckled on bad manufacturing data in the us the new year surge setting the tone for the year may be viewed with some alarm by central banks aware that gold often serves as a proxy for inflation fears
2174011 new conduits such as etfs have opened up giving investors access to a market that used to be off radar it has led to a slow glacial flow of big money into gold that is immune to profit taking on january 9 china will start trading gold futures in shanghai he said
2174012 mr norman the top forecaster for the london bullion market association over the past four years said gold would reach 1 200 an ounce this year veteran gold traders say the metal is enjoying a perfect storm of inflation fears geo strategic jitters over pakistan and mounting concerns that the dollar could lose its role as anchor of the international currency system as mid east and asian states break their dollar pegs
2174013 now that gold is at all time highs is there any way to tell where gold might be going
2174014 when a stock or a commodity advances into new territory or to prices which it has not reached for months or years it shows that the force or driving power is working in that direction
2174015 therefore it is very important to watch old levels of stocks and commodities
2174016 it took 28 years for gold to break out above its 1980 high of 850 in view of what gann says this should be a mighty interesting move coming up for gold
2174017 a continuing refrain heard over the last many years is that gold is not doing what it is supposed to do whatever that means golds value is in the eye of the beholder therefore sentiment will wax and wane just as it does for any other market
2174018 consequently a mantra at fullermoney is that gold and its sister precious metals are best purchased following setbacks psychologically this is not easy because the chart action may raise concerns and sentiment will have deteriorated
2174019 golds new all time numerical high today in usd and most other currencies is just a minor step within the overall upward trend its main significance is that it reaffirms the uptrend it may also improve sentiment and another momentum run is possible
2174020 i maintain that gold is in a secular bull market not least because in this era of ultra competitive pressures from globalisation no country wants a strong currency however some countries need a weak currency more than others and these include the us
2174021 food prices worldwide hit record highs in 2007 and all the signs are that they will go on rising this year and for the foreseeable future the era of cheap food the experts say is over and we are going to have to get used to it
2174022 two major trends have been pushing prices up faster than they have risen for more than 30 years
2174023 at the same time the world is drawing down its stockpiles of cereal and dairy products which makes markets nervous and prices volatile
2174024 industrial metals have been in a corrective phase for much of the year 2007 with nickel and zinc in particular posting significant declines but the longer term demand story for these and almost all other commodities hasnt changed at all asian infrastructure and consumer growth remain some of the most powerful elements affecting commodity markets and this is set to continue for a number of years yet some metals remain at relatively depressed levels although they firmed recently precious metals are setting new highs as are a number of agriculturals i see no evidence that this commodity bull market is over
2174025 emerging markets have weathered the us credit market calamity very well and the bull run will continue in 2008
2174026 the economic decoupling between emerging economies and the us is attributable to underlying fundamentals and is therefore sustainable unlike in the 1990s when emerging economies relied on foreign capital to finance their expansion many of these countries are now net creditors in global financial markets and are not vulnerable to a withdrawal of financing by g7 banks domestic interest rates are still very stimulative thanks to their strong currencies and vast savings which will continue to underpin domestic demand growth while exports to the us have been slowing trade among developing economies is booming as a result overall emerging market growth will not slow considerably even if the us economic slump continues bottom line we recommend that investors continue to overweight emerging equity markets within a global portfolio
2174027 thanks to a surge in recent weeks chinas yuan is set to end 2007 up nearly 7 against the dollar twice the amount it appreciated against the us currency in 2006 and economists forecast a similar pace of upward movement in 2008
2174028 some analysts see the apparent policy shift as a sign of confidence
2174029 i maintain that the yuan is a significantly undervalued currency therefore its long term appreciation potential is considerable this will increase chinas global purchasing power at some point within the next 20 years i assume that the yuan will become fully convertible that would usher in a new era including reserve currency status
2174030 the dollars share of global foreign exchange reserves fell to a record low in the third quarter as demand for us assets waned after the subprime mortgage market collapsed
2174031 the figures suggest central banks diversified out of the dollar as it fell to the lowest level in a decade investors sold a record amount of us securities in august when defaults on subprime mortgages rippled through financial markets and the federal reserve signaled it would cut interest rates
2174032 the dollar seems to be losing at least to some small extent its favored status
2174033 foreign central banks arent necessarily shunning dollar assets but they were more attracted to other currencies
2174034 china russia and other countries with trade surpluses or rising energy export earnings are setting up so called sovereign wealth funds to increase earnings on their reserves speculation also intensified in the third quarter that saudi arabia united arab emirates and other middle eastern nations would follow kuwait and end their currencies pegs to the dollar
2174035 i sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale
2174036 words from the wise for the week that was dec 31 2007 jan 6 2008

2174052 the battle to feed humanity is over in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now
2174053 hundreds of millions of people will soon perish in smog disasters in new york and los angeles the oceans will die of ddt poisoning by 1979 the u s life expectancy will drop to 42 years by 1980 due to cancer epidemics

2174064 it is appointed unto every man once to die and after this the judgment
2174065 i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
2174066 supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all who are in authority
2174067 from those too who call themselves christians we did take a covenant but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them so we estranged them with enmity and hatred between one and the other to the day of judgment

2174076 to me as a woman i think its more degrading to not express yourself to not be open than to show off your body or be confident
2174077 ive received five e mails from female engineers all very positive
2174078 most of the time when i talk to people and i tell them im in engineering i can feel them treating me as one of those nerds
2174079 when people think of engineers they always think of something along the lines of stay in their own cell never go out to meet anyone never do anything for fun their life revolves around a computer for a female engineer it is even worse
2174080 to be honest i am disappointed in the outcome of the calendar
2174081 the maker had a very sound concept to start with however when the focal point is sex instead of intelligence the calendar itself lost its meaning it is now another playboy ish calendar with amateur models that happen to be in engineering
2174082 whereas hundreds of guys had sent in pictures i got maybe four women

2174188 large organizations want the benefit of the saas software as a service and web 2 0 applications namely simplified installation and support but are nervous about running important business applications over the internet
2174189 the word we are hearing from the marketplace is that large corporations have concerns about using saas software as a service solutions for reasons of lack of control uncertain security and worries about the reliability and performance of the internet they want the benefits provided by web 2 0 and saas service providers but want to cut out the communications middle man namely the internet the solution in many cases is an internet appliance
2174190 global businesses in particular are nervous about increasing their reliance on the internet especially after experiences of christmas 2006 when an earthquake near taiwan cut undersea cables communications around the pacific rim were crippled for days and took weeks to return to normal many people are nervous now about relying on the internet for important business tasks the larger the company and the more global their presence the greater their degree of concern
2174191 when we were choosing the technology behind phinza the ability to deploy as an internet appliance was a fundamental requirement as it should be for anyone developing an enterprise level application
2174192 several development tools now allow the economical development of large scale browser based applications that can be deployed in a variety of configurations deployment as an appliance gives us cost efficiency and simplified installation whilst retaining the speed and reliability of a traditional locally installed application
2174193 we see phinza dcm as just part of a larger movement within the it community towards internet appliances
2174194 an saas solution provided using an isp located internet appliance gives customers all the benefits of current saas solutions but with more assured security and performance because it does not rely on the internet cloud over time the distinction between pc based intranet based internet based and isp based applications will become less clear

2174200 the global economy is stalling according to last weeks business confidence survey results sentiment is consistent with a contracting us economy soft european and south america economies and an asian economy that is expanding at the low end of its potential expectations regarding the six month outlook have never been as negative in the over five years of the survey confidence is weakest among real estate firms and financial institutions but it has declined considerably in recent weeks among business service firms and even heretofore more optimistic manufacturers
2174201 the united states has filled various roles at the world economic forum over the past decade dot com dynamo benevolent superpower feared aggressor and now wounded giant
2174202 george soros the financier who made a fortune betting against the pound went so far wednesday as to say that the downturn would put an end to the long status of the dollar as the worlds default currency
2174203 signs of a new economic order abounded in this swiss ski resort the minister of commerce and industry of india kamal nath noted that china had overtaken the united states as indias largest trading partner buttressing his view that india could largely sidestep an american recession
2174204 nouriel roubini an american economist whose frequent predictions of a downturn have made him something of a soothsayer in davos predicted the united states would suffer a recession lasting at least a year
2174205 the federal reserve made bad judgments said joseph stiglitz the nobel prize winning economist it looked the other way when investment banks packaged bad loans in non transparent ways the rate cut this week stiglitz said would be too little too late because monetary policy usually takes between six months and 18 months to be effective and the united states is in distress now
2174206 in a surprise inter meeting move the fomc lowered the federal funds rate and discount rate 75 bps to 3 5 and 4 0 respectively
2174207 the statement noted that 1 weakening economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth 2 deepening of the housing contraction and 3 some softening of labor markets were reasons for the easing of monetary policy
2174208 further easing of monetary policy is on the table but the magnitude and timing is less clear there could be preference to wait until the march 18 fomc meeting to assess the impact of the monetary and fiscal policy easing put in place the futures market has priced a 50 bps cut for the january 30 meeting for today we maintain a fed on hold at the january 30 fomc meeting with a small possibility of further easing
2174209 the fed does not like to act between meetings and todays rate cut was designed to send a signal that policymakers will do whatever is necessary to stop the slide in market confidence and minimize the damage to the economy
2174210 the initial market reaction has been volatile with downside risks remaining a huge concern it is too soon to assume that a bottom in equity prices and peak in financial strains has been reached near term caution is still warranted until credit spreads start to narrow
2174211 the us federal reserve responding to an international stock sell off and fears about a possible us recession cut its benchmark interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point tuesday an aggressive move that came a week ahead of a regularly scheduled meeting of the central bank
2174212 the move unusual in both its scale and its timing underscored the severity of the current strains facing the us economy
2174213 its a once in a generation event mark zandi chief economist at moodys economy com said in recent years the fed has rarely acted between scheduled meetings of the committee and almost always in increments of one quarter or one half point it was the biggest single cut since october 1984
2174214 jan hatzius chief us economist at goldman sachs said the timing of the cut which came after a significant sell off in asian and european stocks on monday may turn market performance into a referendum on the feds move
2174215 this is an effort to catch up and get ahead of flagging confidence in the weakening economy said zandi who has criticized the fed for not responding faster to the current crisis
2174216 its a sad testament to think the fed has to cut interest rates eight days in front of a meeting to salvage the equity markets said bill gross the founder and chief investment officer of pacific investment management co in a bloomberg interview
2174217 fears that americas bond insurance market could implode triggered the us federal reserves biggest interest rate cut for more than a quarter of a century wall street economists claimed yesterday
2174218 market analysts said that wall street had spent last week gradually realising the grave consequences of a major bond insurer defaulting on its commitments and attributed the surprise rate cut to averting such a crisis
2174219 as well as guaranteeing company debt issues the bond insurers underwrite paper from local government in the united states the failure of a bond insurer would reduce funding for state governments or increase its cost threatening infrastructure projects such as building of schools and roads slowing the us economy further
2174220 leading us banks are under pressure from new york states insurance regulator to provide as much as 15 billion to support struggling bond insurers people familiar with the matter said on wednesday night
2174221 there is widespread concern that rating agency downgrades of the specialist insurers known as monolines could force a fresh round of writedowns by banks which could damage already battered investor confidence
2174222 people familiar with the matter said the specifics of a possible capital infusion had yet to be decided
2174223 there are a total of 45 trillion credit default swaps cdss outstanding
2174224 i think the concern that there is the potential for a much worse credit crisis than we are currently experiencing is what is driving the fed
2174225 if i am wrong and the fed was responding to the stock market when cutting the fed funds rate by 75 basis points on january 22 then we will likely not see a cut next week
2174226 a 50 basis point cut takes the rate to 3 it they had cut the rate by 1 25 next week the market would have collapsed better to do it in two leaps is what i think they are thinking we will see and it is not just the fed that is concerned
2174227 the white house and the house leadership have reached an agreement on a plan to juice the economy this year with 140 billion in temporary stimulus measures the plan would give most us workers a tax rebate of 300 to 1 200 a vote in the house was promised at the earliest date
2174228 it would give businesses tax breaks to invest in new equipment this year and would boost the limit on mortgages eligible to be purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac house speaker nancy pelosi and republican leader john boehner said the plan was a true compromise with neither totally satisfied but both said they believed the plan was essential and would help the economy this year senate leaders have not agreed to the plan yet
2174229 even the fed is beginning to realise that although misguided monetary policy and inadequate financial regulation got the us into the mess reversing course will not get it out
2174230 but will the bush administration so long focused on helping the rich be willing to change course
2174231 this is an election year and anything is possible my betting is that the administration wont want to admit just how bad the economy is and that even if a compromise is achieved it will be too little too late
2174232 how about the clowns including bush who keep averring that the economy is sound and whatever downturn appears will be short and shallow then why are 3rd world countries bailing out the leading us financial institutions and the fed cannot allow a 20 decline in stocks
2174233 on a year to year basis the median price of an existing single family home fell 6 5 in december the second largest drop on record with the 6 7 year to year drop in october 2007 holding the record for the largest decline
2174234 the inventory of unsold existing homes fell to a 9 6 month supply from 10 1 month supply in november the high level of inventories suggests that additional price declines in 2008 are likely unlike the market of new homes sellers of existing homes can remove signs and postpone sales which is probably what is occurring
2174235 several indicators suggest that a recession is already priced into risky assets
2174236 similarly the collapse in the global stock to bond ratio is on par with previous recessions or crashes in risky asset prices many equity sectors have already experienced a bear market including us small caps which are down more than 20 from their highs
2174237 in addition the fed funds rate is expected to plunge to 2 by next january which leaves real short rates at similar levels to past mild recessions corporate bond spreads have also blown out to recessionary levels in both the us and europe in fact the gap between us corporate spreads and underlying fundamentals is now at a cyclical extreme bottom line market participants have adjusted rapidly in recent weeks and are already factoring in a recession
2174238 as was the case with japans problems in a very severe credit crisis the issue of which bank survives and which doesnt is more about politics than economic solvency
2174239 so what to buy im afraid cash is the ugly answer that no one ever wants to hear for the first time in many bear markets traditional value stocks are unlikely to help much and may even hurt as they entered the decline badly overpriced and once again if you literally cannot resist buying some stocks we recommend a mix of the highest quality us blue chips and emerging markets
2174240 the collapse of global equity markets on monday january 21 is not just an episode of financial contagion from the us stock market to other stock markets it rather signals that global stock markets are now beginning to price the following things
2174241 first the us recession is unavoidable and has already started and this recession will be ugly deep and severe much more severe than the mild 8 month recessions in 1990 91 and 2001
2174242 second the rest of the world will not decouple from the us since many trade financial currency policy confidence links lead to a transmission of negative growth shocks in the us to the rest of the world that will lead to a sharp global growth slowdown 2008 will be the year of recoupling rather than decoupling
2174243 third the us stock market has already started to reflect in the last few weeks the consequences on earnings and corporate profitability of a severe us recession
2174244 fourth a growing realization that even aggressive fed easing will not prevent this severe recession i e that we are at the last leg of the stock markets suckers rally and that the bernanke put has very little value as massive financial losses will increase regardless of what the fed does
2174245 fifth other global stock markets are now starting to price the effects of the us hard landing on the rest of the world growth the phenomenon of recoupling
2174246 thus the monday massacre in global stock markets is more than a case of financial contagion a revenge of economic fundamentals as investors are waking up from the delusion that the us would avoid a hard landing and that the rest of the world could decouple from such hard landing
2174247 last week treasury secretary paulson when referring to the potential economic stimulus plan averred this is not an emergency
2174248 and lo and behold in a surprise move the fed has panicked this morning and cut the fed funds target interest rates by 75 bp to 3 5 it will be interesting to see if like us the street interprets the fed move as panic whatever the outcome we think a change for the better is approaching so get ready get set
2174249 what will be the effect of this reactionary rather than anticipatory move to cut rates by the fed today
2174250 the uss economic problems are real and a serious concern but there is also a healthy multinational export sector profiting from stronger growth outside the states
2174251 assuming that the fed is now determined to catch up with the curve of events it isnt there yet but has taken a big step today further rate cuts would help a weak economy as would the emergency stimulus package this would lend support to the stock market
2174252 assuming that we see additional rate cuts of at least another 100 basis points in coming months which i believe are necessary and likely
2174253 todays move by the fed makes it much more likely that other central banks will also lower rates in regions where there are legitimate growth concerns this will do no harm to global stock market sentiment
2174254 technically todays rebounds from the days lows for stock market indices in europe and the americas suggest that we have seen climactic lows of at least near term significance
2174255 the rate cut is a big headwind for the us dollar but bullish for precious metals
2174256 the recent bull market began at the highest valuations of any prior bull market in history
2174257 the failure to understand the dynamics of market cycles is a major reason why investors repeatedly overextend their risk near market peaks hold onto their stocks over the full course of a bear market and finally abandon stocks near market troughs
2174258 its important to recognize that one fell swoop market plunges typically feature rising interest rates so even if the us market follows through on the international weakness we saw on monday a bear market under current conditions would in all likelihood be punctuated by some powerful recoveries though ultimately temporary probably several weeks in duration with additional failures later
2174259 given my view that the us economy has probably entered a recession it appears fairly unlikely that the full decline in the s amp p 500 will ultimately fall short of a minimal bear market decline of say 20 taken from the markets recent high that would set an initial expectation at about 1260 on the s amp p 500 of course the average bear market has typically exceeded 30 but i would be surprised if the market weakened below that level without producing a sustained clearing rally first
2174260 it is popular in the us to value equities by comparing the earnings yield on stocks with that available on treasury bonds a system known as the fed model because alan greenspan the former chairman once appeared to use it while giving evidence
2174261 once multiples are adjusted for the earnings cycle by comparing prices to average earnings over the previous 10 years the market no longer looks particularly cheap
2174262 earnings themselves are another source of uncertainty according to thomson financial analysts now expect s amp p 500 earnings to fall by 19 year on year in the fourth quarter when the quarter started they expected growth of 11 5 the sharp fall in apples share price in after hours trading on tuesday following its results showed that the market remained vulnerable to negative earnings surprises this suggested that the market had still not capitulated
2174263 and im wondering what if this bear market lasts four five or six years as you know the big mover in both bull and bear markets are the price earnings ratios the multiples people are willing to pay for stocks as of friday the price earning ratio for the s amp p 500 was over 18 in big bear markets the p e ratio can decline to as low as 5 lets hope this bear market doesnt end with a p e of 5 or 6 or 7 for the s amp p that would be an utter disaster
2174264 also theres been 12 discount rate cuts in presidential election years since 1960 from the close of the date of the cut until the end of the year the stock market in the united states has always always been up always never failed to work i expect that that will pan out too and were going to end the year on a higher note but i do believe were going to rally maybe make a high in march hit a low in july and then that will be it well be up and out from july to the end of the year and its based on history and thats the way these things play up
2174265 there has been extraordinary flight to safety over the past year this has fostered an enormous us treasury rally but soon especially as the recession intensifies investors focus will change from the credit concerns in the system to concern about the credit of the us
2174266 this could unleash a severe bear market in bonds that will be exponentially compounded by the 700 trillion derivatives market because over 2 3 of those derivatives are interest rate related
2174267 very soon getting short us bonds will be the trade of a lifetime and anyone with less than 25 years of experience in the financial industry has not seen a vicious bond bear market
2174268 the european economy may be starting to suffer collateral damage from the us subprime mortgage slump
2174269 there is a clear downtrend in the economy now said michael schubert an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt he revised his ecb forecast last week and predicts two cuts by october after previously projecting one in the final quarter
2174270 the ecb has so far refused to follow the federal reserve and the bank of england in lowering borrowing costs as contagion from the us housing recession spreads arguing that inflation pressures are too strong
2174271 europes manufacturing and services industries probably expanded at the slowest pace since june 2005 and german business confidence fell to the lowest in two years according to surveys of economists by bloomberg news
2174272 the fed has successfully brought its libor rate significantly down the same cannot be said in europe
2174273 the european central bank ecb has a history of lagging the curve but yesterdays comments were especially misguided and disruptive
2174274 specifically ecb president jean claude trichet stated particularly in demanding times of significant market correction and turbulences it is the responsibility of the central bank to solidly anchor inflation expectations to avoid additional volatility it is hardly the time to worry about price pressures the inflationary impact of food and energy prices has peaked and the world economy is experiencing a disinflationary shock from the us and potentially uk housing bear market and slowing global growth even the euro area economy has started to downshift materially in response to extremely tight monetary conditions bottom line stay cautious on risky assets until policymakers capitulate we also reiterate our overweight euro area bond call and preference over treasurys
2174275 while i suppose it is laudable of the european central bank ecb not to give in to peer pressure i also believe that they will have no choice but to cut rates before the end of the year the interest rate differential between the us dollar and the euro is only going to get larger and once the unwinding of leverage has run its course we are already seeing evidence of this then the euro is likely to set new highs depending on how large this move is european companies who consolidate their earnings in euros will have larger problems than is already the case the ecb may well then start to see the evidence of slowing growth they so far fail to recognize
2174276 signs emerged yesterday that china which will be the biggest single national contributor to global growth this year could be hit by serious losses at its banks from the us sub prime home loans debacle
2174277 chinas financial regulator said banks in his country had also built up substantial amounts of bad loans during an investment boom
2174278 japans inflation rate doubled in december to the fastest in more than nine years as companies passed rising oil and commodity costs to consumers core consumer prices which exclude fresh food climbed 0 8 from a year earlier the statistics bureau said today in tokyo
2174279 the global economy is slowing while prices of food and energy keep advancing said hiroshi shiraishi an economist at lehman brothers in tokyo who expects the central bank to keep interest rates on hold this year
2174280 the yen has been steadily appreciating against the us dollar since june and remains in an overall uptrend the yens appreciation of 14 26 is symptomatic of the gradual unwinding of carry trades in that currency and the gradual move to greater risk aversion amongst leveraged traders however carry trades have also been moved to other currencies such as the us dollar which remains in a long term downtrend and has the possibility of further rate cuts this may also be a factor in the continued strength of the yen as it removes a proportion of those who would have normally been short of the currency
2174281 japan is the only major market in the world to have experienced a savage bear market in small capitalized stocks says peter tasker analyst at dresdner kleinwort
2174282 what asset class in the worlds major market is as cheap
2174283 mr tasker says he is often asked what the catalyst is to release value in japanese equities
2174284 in bear markets valuations often overshoot on the downside but there are few asset classes in the world that can currently match the historically low valuations of small capital japan

2174382 una manera muy refinada de reemplazar la ausencia de relaci n sexual fingiendo que somos nosotros quienes ponemos un obst culo en su camino
2174383 en general se evoca el proceso de espiritualizaci n el cambio del anhelo sensual cruda al deseo espiritual elevado la dama es as percibida como un tipo de gu a espiritual en la alta esfera del xtasis religioso en el sentido de la beatriz de dante
2174384 la creaci n de la poes a cort s consiste en plantear seg n el modo de sublimaci n propio del arte un objeto al que designar a como enloquecedor un partenaire inhumano jam s la dama hablando con propiedad es calificada por tal o cual de sus virtudes reales y concretes por su sabidur a su prudencia incluso por su pertinencia si es calificada como sabia no es m s que en tanto participa de una especie de sabidur a inmaterial que m s representa de lo que ejerce sus funciones por el contrario el car cter esencial es el de ser tan arbitraria en sus exigencias de la prueba que impone a su gal n como sea posible es ser esencialmente cruel como se lo ha llamado m s tarde en el momento de los ecos pueriles de esta ideolog a y como se dir m s tarde semejante a las tigresas de hyrcanie
2174385 el contrato aparece como la forma ideal y la condici n necesaria de la relaci n amorosa del cuerpo a la obra de arte de la obra de arte a las ideas hay toda una ascensi n que debe cumplirse a latigazos un esp ritu dial ctico anima a masoch en otro sentido el h roe masoquista parece educado y formado por la mujer autoritaria pero en lo m s profundo es l que la forma y la disfraza y le sopla las duras palabras que ella le dirige
2174386 la aplicaci n de la ley paterna es devuelta a las manos de la mujer o la madre el masoquista persigue algo espec fico en esta transferencia que el placer que la ley le proh be le sea dado precisamente por medio de la ley porque l degustar a trav s de la ley el placer que la ley paterna veda en la medida en que la ley le sea aplicada con m xima severidad por la mujer su sumisi n total significa que l entrega al padre y a la ley paterna para que se haga escarnio de ambos la misma ley que me veda realizar un deseo so pena del castigo consecuente es ahora la que pone al castigo en primer plano y me ordena consecuentemente satisfacer mi deseo he aqu una variedad de humor verdaderamente masoquista
2174387 no se trata de que el masoquista regrese simplemente del nivel paterno al materno permaneciendo dentro del dominio de lo paterno contrato lo que hace es reintroducir a la mujer como socia en el contrato pero no para disfrutarla plenamente sino para burlarse de la autoridad paterna de esta manera el masoquista escenifica un cortocircuito siniestro un monstruoso travestismo de la ley al elevar a la mujer a la condici n de amo indiscutido cuyos caprichos el masoquista debe obedecer uno por uno la convierte en una marioneta controlada de hecho por su esclavo que es quien fija las reglas del juego la asimetr a expl cita del contrato masoquista la subordinaci n del hombre a la mujer descansa en una asimetr a opuesta en el nivel de la posici n de la enunciaci n por lo tanto el humor del masoquista no est dirigido nicamente a la figura del padre se apoya en la incompatibilidad o incongruencia rid cula y a la vez monstruosa entre el lugar simb lico del poder simb lico y el elemento que lo ocupa

2174390 es f cil comprobar que el valor ps quico de la necesidad de amor se hunde tan pronto como se le vuelve holgado satisfacerse hace falta un obst culo para pulsionar a la libido hacia lo alto y donde las resistencias naturales a la satisfacci n no bastaron los hombres de todos los tiempos interpusieron unas resistencias convencionales al goce del amor esto es v lido tanto para los individuos como para los pueblos
2174391 es el obst culo por el cual el hombre no llega a gozar del cuerpo de la mujer
2174392 la dama funciona entonces como un cortocircuito nico en el cual el objeto del deseo coincide con la fuerza que impide alcanzarlo

2174396 this trend has occurred regardless of the concentration of fluoride in water or the use of fluoridated salt
2174397 thus evidence on the potential benefits and harms of adding fluoride to water is relatively poor
2174398 this is especially important for water fluoridation as an uncontrollable dose of fluoride would be given for up to a lifetime regardless of the risk of caries and many people would not benefit
2174399 in the case of fluoridation people should be aware of the limitations of evidence about its potential harms and that it would be almost impossible to detect small but important risks especially for chronic conditions after introducing fluoridation
2174400 used the york reviews findings selectively to give an overoptimistic assessment of the evidence in favor of fluoridation
2174401 artificial fluoridation of drinking water probably does not reduce tooth decay proponents of fluoridation have censored most media ignored intelligent discussion of fluoridation slandered most opponents of fluoridation and overturned legal judgments against fluoridation in a manner that demonstrates their political power many published studies that had conclusions favoring fluoridation were later found unsupported by their raw data
2174402 the bmj article fails to mention the 2006 national research council fluoride review the most comprehensive overview of the toxicology of fluoride ever written the crucial message of the nrcs report is that the highest scientific authority in the us has determined that low levels of fluoride in drinking water may have serious adverse health effects
2174403 government officials who continue to promote fluoridation must testify under oath about why they are ignoring the powerful evidence of harm in the nrc report
2174404 this british medical journal article lends further credence to our efforts to end fluoridation and have congressional hearings held in the us concerning the ongoing government goal to fluoridate more water supplies without individual consent and without any valid evidence of its safety or effectiveness
2174405 40 percent of 162 toddlers examined were suffering from baby bottle tooth decay most averaged two cavities some as many as 20 the cost to one community can be as much as 1 million annually to treat children with this oral disease a tab picked up almost completely by medicaid reasons many pediatric dentists wont care for patients as young as one or two and they often wont accept medicaid
2174406 with dentists fees rising far faster than inflation and more than 100 million people lacking dental insurance the percentage of americans with untreated cavities began rising this decade reversing a half century trend of improvement in dental health
2174407 dentists incomes have grown faster than that of the typical american and the incomes of medical doctors formerly poor relations to physicians american dentists in general practice made an average salary of 185 000 in 2004 the most recent data available that figure is similar to what non specialist doctors make but dentists work far fewer hours dental surgeons and orthodontists average more than 300 000 annually

2174409 citizens to zev halt fluoride open letter to supervisor yaroslavsky
2174410 zev to citizens no comment supervisor approves 20 million grant for fluoride
2174411 some recent studies suggest that over consumption of fluoride can raise the risks of disorders affecting teeth bones the brain and the thyroid gland
2174412 fluoride the most consumed drug in the usa is deliberately added to 2 3 of public water supplies theoretically to reduce tooth decay but with no scientifically valid evidence proving safety or effectiveness
2174413 there is no universally accepted optimal level for daily intake of fluoride
2174414 concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function especially in the thyroid the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism
2174415 a series of epidemiological studies in china have associated high fluoride exposures with lower iq
2174416 e pidemiological studies and tests on lab animals suggest that high fluoride exposure increases the risk of bone fracture especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and diabetics
2174417 iowa children who lived in communities where the water was fluoridated were 50 percent more likely to have mild fluorosis than nine year old children living in nonfluoridated areas of the state
2174418 g enetic environmental and even cultural factors appear to leave some people much more susceptible to the effects of fluoride
2174419 what the nrc committee found is that weve gone with the status quo regarding fluoride for too long and now we need to take a fresh look
2174420 in the scientific community people tend to think that its settled but when we looked at the studies that have been done we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should considering how long this fluoridation has been going on i think thats why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began in the face of ignorance controversy is rampant

2174507 i understand this is the first time a project of this size and type has been considered anywhere in the world and as such will be unique to wa
2174508 the carpenter government has agreed to grant an option on the preferred location for the projects onshore development site adjacent to bps kwinana refinery and rio tintos hismelt plant
2174509 this project has the potential to provide substantial benefits to wa and to the nation
2174510 while the technology to be used is still being developed there are obvious benefits to the australian coal industry to australian energy security and to the national electricity industry
2174511 in addition the global deployment of clean coal technologies such as this has the potential to secure a long term future for the export of coal

2174516 sadly however it seems that not only has the kakapo forgotten how to fly but it has also forgotten that it has forgotten how to fly
2174517 the mating rituals of the kakapo are incredibly long and drawn out fantastically complicated and almost totally ineffective the male kakapo finds himself a rocky promontory overlooking a vast wonderful valley and it hollows out this bowl in the ground it puffs out these two enormous airsacs in its chest the mating call is so deep and so reverberant it carries vast distances the long slow big wavelengths fill the valleys that you cant tell where its coming from so just imagine supposing there are some female kakapos out there which there probably arent and supposing they like the sound of this booming which they probably dont supposing that they can then find where this is coming from which they probably cant if they overcome all those obstacles and actually find the male kakapo the female kakapo will lay one single egg every two years which promptly gets eaten by a stoat or a rat and you think how the hell has this stupid creature lasted this long
2174518 my favorite memory of douglas was when i was doing a
2174519 theres a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy moment for you
2174520 the fact is that its news all over the world
2174521 that would only get a plastic apology anyway if you expect that i might apologise and it be sincere it would come of my own vloition and from the knowledge that what i said hurt peoples feelings not that you are of asian descent and demand it
2174522 the statement that was made was intended solely to make fun of danny devito and no one else since i do not know any chinese i just tried to emulate something it was not intended as an insult anything i would have said to emulate chinese speech would have been taken in the same way in my opinion and we would still be here in the same situation
2174523 now to those of you other that mr liu i do apologise to you if you were hurt by the joke as i said i was only poking fun at danny sorry

2174531 she is still a virgin but in her sexual abstinence she is not a virgin anymore
2174532 teachers really do want to give more information to young people but they just dont have the curriculum or materials
2174533 i dont think they get pregnant on purpose they listen to sex education but they go against it or whatever
2174534 they tell you that sex can cause you to do things you dont want to do and emotional stress
2174535 oftentimes they misunderstand the whole reproductive process for example some think that they cant get pregnant standing up they dont understand conception and thats something they definitely understand by the end of the course
2174536 some kids that take the sex ed class get angry thinking why are they telling me what to do
2174537 if we are going to have sex we might as well have choices
2174538 at least youd know about condoms but they never told us about that
2174539 what if a girl was reading that and was pregnant
2174540 what if she wanted an abortion where would she go how much would it cost do you need parental permission
2174541 they tell you how you get pregnant but not what to do they tell you about abstinence but they stop there
2174542 she gave us little cards to write questions down on its fun
2174543 the church teaches that each and every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life
2174544 the nun clearly confused started scratching her head and replied
2174545 look daddy brought a tree in the house why did he do that
2174546 once a year mommy and daddy bring a tree in the house and call it christmas they hang all these shiny toys on it and tell us not to play with any of them
2174547 how can they expect us not to play with all these wonderful toys
2174548 these are not for suzy to play with theyre just to look at
2174549 i promise i wont play with them i just want to look closer

2174584 the united states and europeans know well that they cannot do anything against iran and their pressure will not hold back irans desire to fully obtain peaceful nuclear technology
2174585 had we been the lone drafters of the resolution of course there might have been other things in it
2174586 but i am quite satisfied and quite certain that the resolution that will be adopted will be one that both says to iran you cannot defy the international community and imposes penalties on iran for that defiance
2174587 they should get off the u n track and go back to the u s eu track which can take action much more quickly and resolutely than the security council can

2174596 i understand where you are coming from with the litter issue i agree but in theory i could just enter as many plate numbers as i wanted and label them as litterers i mean its like convicting someone in public court with no evidence i just think this anti smoking thing is going too far i must say i do not like the idea of the site

2174622 people nowadays are looking to have an emotional connection with their vehicles
2174623 the extra stuff you dont have to have in a car thats whats giving owners grief
2174624 theres no essential major problems with them its the little stuff people paid a lot of money for
2174625 it puts consumers in a position equal to the manufacturer in bargaining
2174626 all high end vehicles have problems its how theyre addressed
2174627 jaguar takes each case as it comes to us and takes into account the dealers actions and what the customer is asking us to do
2174628 i struggle for my money i think i should enjoy it

2174630 its the name i love its not about anything else
2174631 its amazing how much nicer people are to you when you pull up in a land rover
2174632 my job is to get in front of people if they dont take me serious or dont think our company is successful because i dont have an appropriate car it makes sense for me to pay a little more
2174633 if it gets me one extra deal a year its worth it
2174634 i could not stop thinking about what happened and how i was treated i felt anxious all the time about going back to work and facing the man who took advantage of my personal space i felt obsessed with being attacked again my concentration at school was suffering i soon after sought the guidance of a therapist
2174635 i couldnt get away from him fast enough when he hugged me i felt trapped in his tight grip
2174636 supervisors and managers lack the understanding of the law and the proper information
2174637 it was hard to speak to the family members while they were still mourning the death of their son who was killed in a drive by i felt like i was intruding but i also knew it was my job to cover the story
2174638 i was really surprised to see how successful these women are in each of their fields in news broadcasts today you see very few latinas and it really gave me hope that as a minority i still have a chance of being successful in fields where were underrepresented
2174639 its reassuring to see that women like myself can be successful in the media field in a few months ill be looking for a job and its nice to see that there are good role models out there doing what i strive to do
2174640 most of my contacts i made through conferences i attended or summer programs i participated in
2174641 at mtv i was limited to handing out scripts standing there looking cute and getting coffee for my superiors here at fox its just a little more hands on last year they had their own intern pit and responsibilities tend to vary based on the department but all in all ive enjoyed my time with fox a lot more
2174642 my biggest problem is that there was no verification that my paper work was received

2174653 he was just riding around it wasnt like he was hidin it
2174654 this could have been avoided if they had done their job
2174655 i went to go pick him up and he had blood coming from everywhere i just held him and told him to get up
2174656 but he wouldnt get up he was only 4 and he was trying to run to his mommy i couldnt get there in time
2174657 the cops came and took my baby to the hospital and we wasnt even there 5 minutes and he died
2174658 he lindsey looked me dead in my face when my son got shot he knew he shot my son and he looked at me
2174659 gazing with the eye of god he will perceive within every atom a door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude

2174662 while we are pleased that the fda ended its foot dragging and approved plan b for over the counter access for women 18 and older we remain troubled by the scientifically baseless restriction imposed on teenagers new york city has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in the country anything that makes it harder for teenagers to avoid unintended pregnancy is bad medicine and bad public policy
2174663 research shows that over the counter access to emergency contraception does not increase or encourage sexual activity among teens and better access to proven prevention methods like accurate sex education and emergency birth control are the best ways to reduce the alarming rate of teen pregnancy in this country
2174664 knows a lot of people who have a second job just to pay for the rent
2174665 williamsburg and park slope are increasing whereas upper east side and midtown have now reached a plateau

2174667 hunter is the only college campus that is a major subway stop and there have been problems
2174668 security advised me today that a perp was arrested for stealing books who had student id cards for most of the cuny campuses requiring them in that context baruch id cards as most others can readily be faked or borrowed to get access
2174669 to be effective you need guards checking the cards before swiping thus we need more guards in addition to the growing security force we have already
2174670 i think it will make hunter feel more like an educational business and less like an educational community especially if theres not major monies spent beautifying and expanding other public spaces in the college
2174671 the added concern with security and identification may do more to dampen a sense of freedom and openness than enhance a sense of safety and security
2174672 i go to school in the city because i want to learn things i came to eugene lang for the financial aid but i am staying for the way new york inspires my music and lyrics
2174673 i couldnt live with people who werent musicians or at least artists i need to feel as if im part of a community that is moving forward and making progress i need to be living with people that are transcending their creative boundaries
2174674 ive known i wanted to be a musician since i was twelve after i reached that conclusion that i wanted to play music all i needed to do was get there a lot of the kids at the jazz school are still learning the theory that i was crazy about in ninth grade id say its about fifty fifty some people come to the jazz school ready to play with masters but some of the other kids still dont really know all of their scales

2174690 fluoridation is against all principles of modern pharmacology its really obsolete
2174691 the nrc report dramatically changed scientific understanding of fluorides health risks
2174692 government officials who continue to promote fluoridation must testify under oath as to why they are ignoring the powerful evidence of harm in the nrc report
2174693 the most up to date expert authority on the health effects of fluoride exposure
2174694 it is time for the us to recognize that fluoridation has serious risks that far outweigh any minor benefits and unlike many other environmental issues its as easy to end as turning off a valve at the water plant
2174695 the results suggest that there is a strong association of occurrence of periodontal disease in high fluoride areas
2174696 surprisingly studies have not paid attention to the periodontal status in high fluoride areas from a research perspective
2174697 in addition to inflammatory process which remains common to high and low fluoride areas the fluorosis induced changes in hard and soft tissues of periodontium requires attention to suspect fluoride as an etiological environmental agent for periodontal disease
2174698 how much longer do the american people have to be the guinea pigs in the u s s fluoridation experiment
2174699 who will decide when fluorides mounting risks outweigh its questionable benefits the individual or the government
2174700 this would be a good time to gracefully bow out of water fluoridation

2174713 you might not like it if you want to change the name to something else im curious to see what title you pick
2174714 in my opinion the evidence that fluoridation is more harmful than beneficial is now overwhelming and policy makers who avoid thoroughly reviewing recent data before introducing new fluoridation schemes do so at risk of future litigation

2174716 two studies reported that extended consumption of infant formula beyond age 10 12 months was a risk factor for enamel fluorosis especially when formula concentrate was mixed with fluoridated water the iowa study also reported that infant formula and processed baby food contained variable amounts of fluoride
2174717 drinking fluoridated water brushing with fluoride toothpaste or using other fluoride dental products can raise the concentration of fluoride in saliva present in the mouth 100 to 1 000 fold
2174718 some persons choose to modify this condition with elective cosmetic treatment
2174719 most persons would be classified as low risk for cavities at any given time
2174720 when classification is uncertain treating a person as high risk is prudent until further information or experience allows a more accurate assessment this assumption increases the immediate cost of caries prevention or treatment and might increase the risk for enamel fluorosis for children aged

2174722 newburgh kingston caries fluorine study xiii pediatric findings after ten years
2174723 the average age at the menarche was 12 years among the girls studied in newburgh and 12 years 5 months among the girls in kingston
2174724 a few more children in the range below 12 9 grams per hundred milliliters in newburgh
2174725 a slightly higher proportion of children in newburgh were found to have a total erythrocyte red blood cell count below 4 400 000 per milliliter
2174726 the university of rochester conducted its own studies measuring how much fluoride newburgh citizens retained in their blood and tissues health department personnel cooperated shipping blood and placenta samples to the rochester scientists
2174727 the more fluoride a child drinks the more cavities appear in the teeth
2174728 our findings indicate that dental caries is caused by high fluoride and low dietary calcium intakes separately and through their interactions

2174731 i have long been a campaigner on issues relating to black health and in particular those concerning african caribbean men i fully support the work the charity is doing to help raise awareness of the disease amongst the african community in the uk and wish them every success with this campaign knowing where to turn for good information and support is the first step available to us women in dealing with the effects this devastating disease can have on the men in our lives
2174732 we have been working specifically with african and african caribbean communities to raise awareness of prostate cancer for three years
2174733 this campaign is a direct response to what people have been telling us they need although only men can get prostate cancer we know women can play an important role in ensuring that the men in their lives are given the best possible chance of beating the disease by knowing more about the risk factors involved and being proactive if they have concerns
2174734 it is harder to recruit adopters from bme communities partly because they think they arent eligible to adopt and partly due to the reluctance of bme adults to approach social services departments at nch black families we actively engage with the bme communities to overcome these issues and encourage more people to adopt
2174735 our pilot project in london has been a great success placing over 50 children with safe and loving families since we were established in 2003 by expanding the service to the midlands and the north of england we hope to be able to provide stable homes for more children of bme heritage across the country but we urgently need more people to come forward and consider adopting to help us do this

2174743 we spent almost a year and a half off and on doing this record so there was less of a goal in mind for the album as a whole we tended to focus on each song individually we wanted to make strong singles
2174744 consequently none of us really knew what to expect until we finished the sequencing just a few weeks ago i think its a pretty upbeat record for the most part i dont think anyone expects our records to sound like anything else weve done but this one seems pretty different from the last i hope everyones always surprised

2174777 the good news is that demand increased last year there was only a limited amount of new supply in apartments and there were only about 330 units completed last year but the number of condominium units grew by over 4 000 units that will continue to be the case in the next two to three years
2174778 from a supply point of view the big question is how many of these apartments are expat quality and how many owners of these new condominiums will want to lease them out
2174779 recently a new supply has appeared in the downtown area and theres been a greater focus on small sized units many of them aimed at the thai market so not all the new condo supply will be of a standard that appeals to expats but there are a lot of condo units
2174780 of the developments that are just coming up to completion the number that will be available for rent ranges between 30 50 at the moment so although demand has risen there will be quite a lot of condominium supply coming on
2174781 so if the air conditioner breaks down whos going to fix it it will not be the staff looking after the common areas of the condominium because their responsibility is not private property so owners must think about how they will manage and maintain the units
2174782 again youve got access to the skytrain but in a slightly lower density environment
2174783 the biggest change in the market has been that japanese with families now receive higher allowances than they did previously
2174784 some will give bt70 000 or bt75 000 for a three bedroom apartment the japanese tend to be at the lower end of the market but they are a significant level of demand
2174785 whats happened is that much of the existing stock is over 10 years old weve seen very few apartments built since the financial crisis over the last 10 years more condominiums and what has been happening is that new supply with smaller units is actually getting higher rents because it looks better modern design
2174786 sansiri on 67 had rented well but there is a limited market for people with over bt100 000 a month to spend
2174787 there are few companies that pay that kind of housing allowance
2174788 the rental market is efficient in terms of transparent pricing information on products and a regular turnover
2174789 so if a building doesnt maintain its standards then new expats will not move in

2174814 and when your land is once more filled with people says the lord you will no longer wish for the good old days when you possessed the ark of the lords covenant you will not miss those days or even remember them and there will be no need to rebuild the ark 17 in that day jerusalem will be known as the throne of the lord all nations will come there to honor the lord they will no longer stubbornly follow their own evil desires

2174816 w e have been taught that to expose newly born children is the part of wicked men and this we have been taught lest we should do anyone harm and lest we should sin against god first because we see that almost all so exposed not only the girls but also the males are brought up to prostitution and for this pollution a multitude of females and hermaphrodites and those who commit unmentionable iniquities are found in every nation and you receive the hire of these and duty and taxes from them whom you ought to exterminate from your realm and any one who uses such persons besides the godless and infamous and impure intercourse may possibly be having intercourse with his own child or relative or brother and there are some who prostitute even their own children and wives and some are openly mutilated for the purpose of sodomy and they refer these mysteries to the mother of the gods
2174817 give studious attention to the prophetic writings the bible and they will lead you on a clearer path to escape the eternal punishments and to obtain the eternal good things of god god will examine everything and will judge justly granting recompense to each according to merit to those who seek immortality by the patient exercise of good works he will give everlasting life joy peace rest and all good things for the unbelievers and for the contemptuous and for those who do not submit to the truth but assent to iniquity when they have been involved in adulteries and fornications and homosexualities and avarice and in lawless idolatries there will be wrath and indignation tribulation and anguish and in the end such men as these will be detained in everlasting fire
2174818 all honor to that king of the scythians whoever anacharsis was who shot with an arrow one of his subjects who imitated among the scythians the mystery of the mother of the gods condemning him as having become effeminate among the greeks and a teacher of the disease of effeminacy to the rest of the scythians
2174819 it is not then without reason that the poets call him hercules a cruel wretch and a nefarious scoundrel it were tedious to recount his adulteries of all sorts and debauching of boys for your gods did not even abstain from boys one having loved hylas another hyacinthus another pelops another chrysippus another ganymede let such gods as these be worshipped by your wives and let them pray that their husbands be such as these so temperate that emulating them in the same practices they may be like the gods such gods let your boys be trained to worship that they may grow up to be men with the accursed likeness of fornication on them received from the gods

2174822 t urn your looks to the abominations not less to be deplored of another kind of spectacle men are emasculated and all the pride and vigor of their sex is effeminated in the disgrace of their enervated body and he is more pleasing there who has most completely broken down the man into the woman he grows into praise by virtue of his crime and the more he is degraded the more skillful he is considered to be such a one is looked upon oh shame and looked upon with pleasure nor is there wanting authority for the enticing abomination that jupiter of theirs is not more supreme in dominion than in vice inflamed with earthly love in the midst of his own thunders now breaking forth by the help of birds to violate the purity of boys and now put the question can he who looks upon such things be healthy minded or modest men imitate the gods whom they adore and to such miserable beings their crimes become their religion
2174823 oh if placed on that lofty watch tower you could gaze into the secret places if you could open the closed doors of sleeping chambers and recall their dark recesses to the perception of sight you would behold things done by immodest persons which no chaste eye could look upon you would see what even to see is a crime you would see what people embruted with the madness of vice deny that they have done and yet hasten to do men with frenzied lusts rushing upon men doing things which afford no gratification even to those who do them

2174827 if you o monk are young in either body or mind shun the companionship of other young men and avoid them as you would a flame for through them the enemy has kindled the desires of many and then handed them over to eternal fire hurling them into the vile pit of the five cities under the pretense of spiritual love at meals take a seat far from other young men in lying down to sleep let not their clothes be near yours but rather have an old man between you when a young man converses with you or sings psalms facing you answer him with eyes cast down lest perhaps by gazing at his face you receive a seed of desire sown by the enemy and reap sheaves of corruption and ruin whether in the house or in a place where there is no one to see your actions be not found in his company under the pretense either of studying the divine oracles or of any other business whatsoever however necessary
2174828 the pagans were addicted to the love of boys and one of their wise men made a law that pederasty should not be allowed to slaves as if it was an honorable thing and they had houses for this purpose in which it was openly practiced and if all that was done among them was related it would be seen that they openly outraged nature and there was none to restrain them as for their passion for boys whom they called their paedica it is not fit to be named
2174829 certain men in church come in gazing about at the beauty of women others curious about the blooming youth of boys after this do you not marvel that lightning bolts are not launched from heaven and all these things are not plucked up from their foundations for worthy both of thunderbolts and hell are the things that are done but god who is long suffering and of great mercy forbears awhile his wrath calling you to repentance and amendment
2174830 all of these affections in rom 1 26 27 were vile but chiefly the mad lust after males for the soul is more the sufferer in sins and more dishonored than the body in diseases
2174831 the men have done an insult to nature itself and a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it when even the women seek after these intercourses who ought to have more shame than men
2174832 and sundry other books of the philosophers one may see full of this disease but we do not therefore say that the thing was made lawful but that they who received this law were pitiable and objects for many tears for these are treated in the same way as women that play the whore or rather their plight is more miserable for in the case of the one the intercourse even if lawless is yet according to nature but this is contrary both to law and nature for even if there were no hell and no punishment had been threatened this would be worse than any punishment
2174833 t hose shameful acts against nature such as were committed in sodom ought everywhere and always to be detested and punished if all nations were to do such things they would be held guilty of the same crime by the law of god which has not made men so that they should use one another in this way
2174834 christians abhor all unlawful mixtures and that which is practiced by some contrary to nature as wicked and impious
2174835 you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination
2174836 if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman both of them have committed a detestable act they shall surely be put to death
2174837 or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god
2174838 realizing the fact that civil law is not made for a righteous man but for those who are lawless and rebellious for the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for those who kill their fathers or mothers for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
2174839 for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error

2174842 this information should be heeded by physicians and members of the medical and scientific communities dr susheela is a world authority on the health effects of fluoride to the human body

2174930 otak hanyalah aktiviti aktiviti bio elektrik yang melibatkan sekumpulan saraf yang dipertanggungjawabkan untuk melakukan tugas tugas tertentu bagi membolehkan ia berfungsi dengan sempurna setiap hari 14 juta saraf yang membentuk otak ini berinteraksi dengan 16 juta saraf tubuh yang lain semua aktiviti yang kita lakukan dan kefahaman atau ilmu yang kita peroleh adalah natijah daripada aliran interaksi bio elektrik yang tidak terbatas
2174931 oleh itu apabila seorang itu berzikir dengan mengulangi kalimat kalimat allah seperti subhanallah beberapa kawasan otak yang terlibat menjadi aktif ini menyebabkan berlakunya satu aliran bio elektrik di kawasan kawasan saraf otak tersebut apabila zikir disebut berulang ulang kali aktiviti saraf ini menjadi bertambah aktif dan turut menambah tenaga bio elektrik lama kelamaan kumpulan saraf yang sangat aktif ini mempengaruhi kumpulan saraf yang lain untuk turut sama aktif dengan itu otak menjadi aktif secara keseluruhan otak mula memahami perkara baru melihat dari sudut perspektif berbeza dan semakin kreatif dan kritis sedang sebelum berzikir otak tidak begini otak yang segar dan cergas secara tidak langsung mempengaruhi hati untuk melakukan kebaikan dan menerima kebenaran
2174932 hasil kajian makmal yang dilakukan terhadap subjek ini dimuatkan dalam majalah scientific american keluaran disember 1993 satu kajian yang dilakukan di universiti washington dan ujian ini dilakukan melalui ujian imbasan pet yang mengukur kadar aktiviti otak manusia secara tidak sedar dalam kajian ini sukarelawan diberikan satu senarai perkataan benda mereka dikehendaki membaca setiap perkataan tersebut satu persatu dan mengaitkan perkataan perkataan dengan kata kerja yang berkaitan apabila sukarelawan melakukan tugas mereka beberapa bahagian berbeza otak mempamerkan peningkatan aktiviti saraf termasuk di bahagian depan otak dan korteks
2174933 menariknya apabila sukarelawan ini mengulangi senarai perkataan yang sama berulang ulang kali aktiviti saraf otak merebak pada kawasan lain dan mengaktifkan kawasan saraf lain apabila senarai perkataan baru diberikan kepada mereka aktiviti saraf kembali meningkat di kawasan pertama ini sekali gus membuktikan secara saintifik bahawa perkataan yang diulang ulang seperti perbuatan berzikir terbukti meningkatkan kecergasan otak dan menambah kemampuannya

2174977 at nude beaches we swim we play volleyball we lay in the sun we do the same things everyone else does at the beach we just prefer to do it without clothing
2174978 other people i dont know the right way to say this but they think its more sexual kind of they dont understand just the being free with your body and being comfortable

2175096 creo que de la misma manera que yo amo mi vida los j venes tambi n deben amar la suya porque la vida es el mejor regalo que tenemos

2175133 when we develop in a community we like to get actively involved in the community around it
2175134 when we did the initial groundbreaking i met reverend calhoun he explained how they were working for years trying to get this community center they just had some grants but they were nowhere near where they needed to be to make this dream a reality i spoke to the reverend and was quite impressed and thought this was a great opportunity to get involved and help this community
2175135 where there are established neighborhoods you want to make sure this is about the life of the neighborhood and not getting swallowed up in this huge development
2175136 it will be a destination center all the things the community has been doing can really be expanded

2175187 men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object than when it is dissipated among a great variety of things but in consequence of the division of labor the whole of every mans attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one very simple object

2175220 the problem is with the sellers who dont have their homes priced correctly
2175221 i had a seller a week ago who got a 440 000 offer in a matter of days on a 450 000 asking price and he turned it down
2175222 based on the retreat of investors and or speculators and some temporary hesitancy on the part of second and third homebuyers in many of floridas coastal markets you would expect to see a measurable drop in sales year over year
2175223 with the strength of the underlying economy continued job growth and rebounding tourism we are optimistic about increased sales activity in the second quarter and beyond

2175327 ketika kaum muslimin berada dalam shalat fajar di hari senin sedangkan abu bakar menjadi imam mereka ketika itu mereka dikejutkan oleh muhammad saw yang membuka hijab kamar aisyah beliau melihat kaum muslimin sedang dalam shaf shalat kemudian beliau tersenyum kepada mereka

2175332 were doing it with batteries available now were not waiting for the technology to develop
2175333 my next dream is that one of the automakers will say they want to put this system on their car
2175334 we could give them exclusive use for two years and then we could license it to others consumers could recover the 8 700 cost in fuel savings in three and a half years with gas at 2 85 and in less time at higher prices
2175335 a breakthrough in battery technology has been two years away for 20 years
2175336 we want to find out how much electric only range people want and how much they want to pay for it the batteries arent free

2175407 buddhism would remain inexplicable if one did not place at its beginning a strong personality who was its founder
2175408 it is very rare indeed to hear the word buddha in this world
2175409 it is a name derived from the final liberation of the enlightened ones the blessed ones together with the omniscient knowledge at the root of the enlightenment tree this name
2175410 buddha means one who embodies the way it is the one who reacts to the stimuli of the world in all pervading accordance with the needs of all beings the one who abstains from activity and who is yet universally active
2175411 the superhuman personality of the buddha and its symbolism in the mahaparinirvanasutra
2175412 began to conceive the transcendence of the buddha perfect in all points superior through distance from all beings unique the beatific had evidently taken in the thought of his followers the place which the devotees of the great religions attributed to the great god whom they adored
2175413 the self which is free from evil ageless deathless sorrowless hungerless thirstless whose desire is the real he should be searched out
2175414 mr president i cannot tell you exactly when it will happen probably within 15 years but europe is going to be a federal state and you have to prepare yourself for that you have to work out with us and the european leaders how you would react to that how would you allow the other easteuropean countries to interact with it or how to become a part of it you have to be prepared
2175415 i imagined them saying they then turned as one and retraced their steps as i have to eat a gluten free diet and my bread is six dollars a loaf i am not willing to share it
2175416 he knows a lot more about it than anybody hes discovered a wonderful way to be happy
2175417 who would sell a car like that for fifteen dollars
2175418 she must be a child abuser who knows what she will do next john you go right up there and see whats going on
2175419 this morning i got a phone call from my husband i thought he was on a business trip but learned from a friend he has run off to hawaii with his secretary and really doesnt intend to come back he claimed he was stranded and asked me to sell his new porsche and send him the money so i did
2175420 because of writers block i sort of figured that if i could spend a half an hour at the beginning of each day writing about something then at least i would have done something constructive and also it might get me in a writing frame of mind and help with the work i actually have to do
2175421 it reminds you of great stuff that youve forgotten and is also a window to your emotions at the time
2175422 i dont think they were expecting us to be in red
2175423 i think what we need to do is settle our nerves and get back to the fundamentals
2175424 were a team that thrives on winning the small battles and thats something we need to do to win the series
2175425 breaking bonds what to think of barry bonds passing hank aarons 755
2175426 were praying god willing to get her the end of june or the first part of july
2175427 the first time we adopted we got a second mortgage on our house and a few small grants we kept telling each other that god would provide the money
2175428 while we were in ethiopia one week into our trip i received a call from my mother an anonymous donor had funded the entire cost of the adoption that was a huge confirmation to us that we were doing the right thing
2175429 we were like no way all the initial panic of the 1980s about hiv crossed my mind and i couldnt even imagine it
2175430 but when i got off the phone i thought i really think i need to research this before i squelch it i learned that hiv has never been passed in a family setting that it is a chronic and manageable disease and that many of these kids grow up marry and have families and never pass on the disease
2175431 because of what we had already endured with our boys it didnt seem like something we couldnt handle as a family we had been told the boys were born brain damaged but as time went on neither child exhibited any outstanding issues
2175432 because our birth children were spared a grim future we felt we needed to do something a little less conventional
2175433 we learned that an immigration law would require that our hiv positive child stay in ethiopia for several months after he was adopted
2175434 then we found an incredible attorney in washington d c and she lobbied to bring this issue to the forefront
2175435 one of the reasons that it took three months is that it would sit in a mail room before being delivered to the right persons desk
2175436 but that person would have a lot of other duties and responsibilities too so that waiver could sit in a to do stack for weeks then if she went on vacation for one to two weeks as she had the right to do the requests coming in werent being processed
2175437 they were eating out of trash containers until the police had brought them into the orphanage and she tested positive for hiv being separated from her siblings and living in an hiv positive orphanage was more than she could take at that point
2175438 though he said memorial day shouldnt be politicized democratic presidential hopeful barack obama used a visit to a war monument monday to repeat his call for better services for veterans

2175449 court systems are eager to introduce mandatory mediation as a means to meet their needs to reduce case loads and adversarial litigation and participants who understand the empowerment of mediation to self determine their own agreements are equally as eager to embrace mediation as an alternative to costly and potentially harmful litigation

2175453 we need to put our differences aside and focus on the future together i believe that the world banks best days are still to come
2175454 replacing one bush appointee with another will not resolve the fundamental governance problems of the world bank
2175455 member governments should reject a back door deal that leaves the banks governance structure intact and should press for an open merit based selection process
2175456 once i start at the world bank i will be eager to meet the people who drive the agenda of overcoming poverty in all regions with particular attention to africa advancing social and economic development investing in growth and encouraging hope opportunity and dignity
2175457 russia is acting against unipolaritys accommodating ideologies and politics against its recently resurgent manifestations and machinations and against the instruments of its perpetuation such as the north atlantic treaty organisation nato
2175458 a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 percent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprise and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 percent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
2175459 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the us department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy
2175460 ball presented an outline of the advantages of a new colonial world economic order based on the concept of a world company and described some of the obstacles that needed to be eliminated for its success according to ball the first and most important thing that had to be eliminated was the archaic political structure of the nation state
2175461 ball wrote to be productive we must begin our inquiry by explicitly recognizing the lack of phasing between development of the world company a concept responding to modern needs and the continued existence of an archaic political structure of nation states mostly small or of only medium size which is evolving only at glacier pace in response to new world requirements of scope and scale
2175462 it was clear for ball that the very structure of the nation state and the idea of the commonwealth or of a general welfare of a people represented the main obstacle against any attempt of freely looting the planet especially the weak and poor nations of the world and represented the most important impediment to the creation of a neo colonial world empire
2175463 where does one find a legitimate base for the power of corporate managements to make decisions that can profoundly affect the economic life of nations to whose governments they have only limited responsibility
2175464 i dont think a global ruling class exists business influences society and politics influences purely common sense its not that business contests the right of democratically elected leaders to lead
2175465 this colonisation masked as reforms destroyed the basic institutions of russian society along the following basic lines 1 destruction of the financial system of the state by means of an endless build up of the state debt pyramid shrinking of the tax base deepening of the non payments crisis and disorganisation of the monetary system 2 destruction of the scientific and technological potential of the country achieved by means of a many fold reduction in state financing of science the collapse of technological cooperation and scientific production integration in the course of mass privatisation and the refusal of the government to have any scientific and technical industrial or structural policy at all 3 sale of controlling blocs of shares in the leading and most valuable russian firms in industry electric power and telecommunications to foreign companies 4 transfer of the right to exploit the most valuable russian raw materials deposits to transnational corporations 5 establishment of foreign control over the russian stock exchange 6 establishment of direct foreign control over the shaping of russian domestic and foreign economic policy
2175466 the us can no longer ride roughshod over nor bully nor simply ignore resurgent russia rising china or the globes regimes that supply the vital oil that fuels the us economy something must be done and urgently in order to cut deeply into russias mounting global energy leverage the us russia strategically deteriorating relations are one victim of this geopolitical struggle for energy supremacy
2175467 no us russia military confrontation is likely no matter how tense things should get
2175468 aggressive unilateralist us foreign policy has forced axis of evil states to accelerate their pursuit of nuclear weapons to immunise themselves against us military strikes
2175469 has managed to discredit a lot of our basic notions in the eyes of the afghans
2175470 they returned to afghanistan and formed a branch of the brothers the islamic society later these same professors as they were known would form the backbone of the afghan mujahedin who waged a us backed decade long war against the soviet occupation the three leading professors were abdul rasul sayyaf burhanuddin rabbani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
2175471 get embroiled in a soviet style long term engagement as in the 1980s
2175472 from a five year plan of destruction to a five year plan of colonisation
2175473 necessary to prepare for the worst and the worst is war
2175474 none of them think it is a good idea but they will do it if they are told to
2175475 every effort should be made to stop iran from obtaining nuclear weapons but failing that the world could live with a nuclear armed iran
2175476 you can deter iran but there is no strategy against nuclear terrorism
2175477 there is no question that we can take out iran the problem is the follow on the velvet revolution that needs to be created so the iranian people know its not aimed at them but at the iranian regime
2175478 to provide planning inputs to warfighters that are strategically operationally and tactically sound logistically supportable and politically feasible
2175479 when saddam invaded kuwait we had access to unlimited numbers of people with expertise including all the intelligence agencies and were able to be significantly more agile than centcom
2175480 if somebody says iran it says here is what you need to think about here are the objectives here are the risks here is what it will cost here are the numbers of planes we will lose here is how the war is going to end and here is what the peace will look like
2175481 the centcoms of this world are executional they dont have the staff the expertise or the responsibility to do the thinking that is needed before a country makes the decision to go to war war planning is not just about bombs airplanes and sailing boats

2175492 thats right whether its a gallon of milk or a rolls royce the gt gt exact money is always there
2175493 my second wish was for a tall gt gt chick with a big ass and long legs who agrees with everything i say
2175494 i could see that he had a reservation in his mind that he suspected me of an ulterior motive that he would serve the cause of my love only partially subject to certain moral principles and i hated him for it
2175495 hey brainiac the sign says 49 you are going the wrong way turn around

2175502 bollywood accounts for over 40 percent of the total revenues of the overall indian film industry but there is no organised format or means to consume this experience
2175503 if anything goes wrong in any part of the state the government headed by parkash singh badal shall be solely responsible and answerable bjp will not hesitate in taking hard decisions in the larger interests of the people of punjab
2175504 despite offer of full cooperation to the state government for restoration of peace and tranquility the administration is running away from its fundamental duty of safeguarding life and property of citizens
2175505 it is going to be a news cum entertainment channel
2175506 it is a business deal so we will go to them who offer the better deal
2175507 the child welfare committee has formally decided to impose a ban on budhia singhs proposed bhubaneswar to calcutta walk the committee felt the walk may have an adverse impact on the childs health
2175508 use of a child be it for a marathon run or a walk amounts to torture and we are here to stop that
2175509 the committees decision is most unfortunate they are unnecessarily harassing budhia

2175512 but the journey has been quite exciting especially in the last one year when the big banners suddenly woke up to me
2175513 i owe that score and a lot of the other things that i compose to laxmikant pyarelal they are my idols and role models unfortunately thats not the sound that todays average listener wants to hear i realised that when just chill and aashiq banaya aapne hit the charts
2175514 but i realise the profile of music listeners has changed considerably today the average listener is aged 23 and he downloads music from his computer my songs have to be targeted at that 23 year old dude thats the only way a film score can work
2175515 yes i realise that but thats it im not going to pursue that sound beyond this year i like to create a sound and then leave it behind this year youll hear a totally different sound from me in china town satish kaushiks shaadi se pehle priyadarshans phir hera pheri anil sharmaa apne and dharmesh darshans aap ki khatir

2175519 no act or thought of mine shall deny that i have already received in spirit the fulfillment of my desire and it is now brought forth into perfect visibility
2175520 i thank you father that i now have love wisdom and understanding life health strength and eternal youth harmony happiness and abundant prosperity and the method of bringing forth from the universal substance that which will satisfy every good desire
2175521 the law is as you know your prayer is granted and what things you desire when you pray know you receive them and you shall have them
2175522 then the instructions are you shall love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind and with all your strength
2175523 the secret lies in getting the at one ment getting the consciousness of it and then
2175524 the father that dwells in me he does the work have faith in god have faith and doubt not have faith and fear not now remember there is no limitations to gods power all things are possible
2175525 fill the seemingly blank spaces about you with the thought of god infinite good then remember the word god is a seed it must grow
2175526 keep the thought of gods abundance always in mind if any other thought comes replace it with that of gods abundance and bless that abundance give thanks constantly if need be that the work is done
2175527 when the demonstration is complete you will look back upon the time faithfully given as one of your greatest treasures
2175528 try me and see if i will not open the windows of heaven and pour out such a blessing there will not be room to receive it
2175529 in the heart of my being father i am one with you and i recognize you as being the father of all
2175530 the words which i now speak outline to you my father that which i desire as a seed it is planted in the soil of my soul and moved upon by your quickening life in my spirit it must come forth i allow only your spirit wisdom love and truth to move in my soul i desire only that which is good for all and i now ask you father to bring it forth
2175531 father within me i ask to express love wisdom strength and eternal youth i ask to realize harmony happiness and abundant prosperity that i may have the understanding direct from you of the method of bringing forth from the universal substance that which will satisfy every good desire this is not for self father but that i may have the understanding so that i may be of service to all your children
2175532 no act or thought of mine shall deny that i have already received in spirit the fulfillment of my desire and it is now brought forth into perfect visibility
2175533 i thank you father that i now have love wisdom and understanding life health strength and eternal youth harmony happiness and abundant prosperity and the method of bringing forth from the universal substance that which will satisfy every good desire
2175534 said i not unto you that if you would believe you should see the glory of god
2175535 understand that if it is not finished and your desire is not now visible the fault is within yourselves and not with god
2175536 now faith is the substance of things hoped for evidence of things not seen
2175537 at 8 00 am pm on august 8 2008 8 8 all lightworkers and keepers of the earth should invoke the symbols of the number 888 into themselves because 888 symbolizes the sacred number of christ invoke christs infinite wisdom of loving thy neighbor as thyself into your heart
2175538 if you want to create a soul to take a spiritual path give them the appropriate astrology
2175539 this isnt about performance its about authenticity credibility and clarity its whether the organizations various constituents are able to understand believe and relate to what the ceo is telling them gesturing should be natural if its prompted by a script or some other instruction its not
2175540 was it a mistake we were suckers for the kla
2175541 u s supported al qaeda cells during balkan wars fought serbian troops
2175542 said that a goal in bosnia was to mollify the muslim world and to counter any perception of an anti muslim bias regarding american policies in iraq in the period leading up to gulf war i
2175543 the result of years of policies thus inspired is a terrorist base in the heart of europe a moral debacle and the absence of any positive payoff to the united states
2175544 but already the albanians of kosovo believe that independence is the very least they are due and dont hesitate to attack un officials or nato troops that are perceived to stand in the way
2175545 probably the same people who were raping and murdering the kosovars in the first place
2175546 three synchronized explosions in kosovos capital city were aimed at blocking the path to independence from serbia the provinces ethnic albanian president and prime minister said on sunday
2175547 in my book it is pretty obvious that in the very story she cites the serbs are again attacking the kosovars that is evidence that we are enabling jihadists what the
2175548 nato prepared to deal with possible civil disturbances in kosovo
2175549 called for the area to be included in kosovo under k for administration but nato the un and the us have called on his group to disband and respect current borders
2175550 announced terrorist attacks against the infidels i e great britain the usa france israel russia india and serbia
2175551 but the fringe in the us that sees every albanian as a terrorist every muslim a wahhabi and kosovar independence a direct threat to the very existence of europe
2175552 in the eyes of the radical islamic circles the establishment of an independent islamic territory including bosnia kosovo and albania along the adriatic coast is one of the most prominent achievements of islam since the siege of vienna in 1683 islamic penetration into europe through the balkans is one of the main achievements of islam in the twentieth century
2175553 found new sanctuary in the balkans in the hotbed of european terrorism kosovo he arrived in kosovo from albania until recently bin laden was training a group of almost 500 mujahedin from arab countries around the albanian towns of podgrade and korce for terrorist actions in kosovo
2175554 responsible for the murder of three british tourists in december 1998
2175555 kosovo has become the latest and most significant arena for radical islamic states and groups that seek to widen their influence in europe
2175556 with all the attention on iraq everyone underestimates this region no one understands that what happens here will play a key role in european security for the next 10 years
2175557 b92 news site into the national guards the daily falcon newspaper according to serbianna columnist dr miroljub jevtic the most extreme imam in bosnia comes from kosovo
2175558 enough is enough the time was yesterday today is already too late tomorrow is dangerous
2175559 yes mr patrick the saudis are building everywhere they can this is causing many problems all over but since they bring with them millions of american dollars there isnt much that we can do to keep them out
2175560 they especially hate the serbs in some fbi reports it has been demonstrated that has its people in kosovo and that domestic people from kosovo are among them
2175561 and was comforted to learn that although our politicians may not get it the army certainly understands who the enemy is today
2175562 every american and spanish soldier i meet in kosovo says the same thing our mission was to protect albanians
2175563 killing officers and soldiers poisoning food and water sabotage breaking into weapons arsenals and stealing arms and ammunition desertion and causing flagrant nationalist incidents in army units
2175564 not a shred of evidence exists that such a meeting ever happened
2175565 dude you must be paid a pretty penny by the serbs or greeks to talk like that about albania its political past and future under sali berisha or any other albanian leader
2175566 shouldnt we in albania fix things here first before trying to export our despotic regime elsewhere
2175567 albanians and serbs in kosovo an abbreviated history an opening for the islamic jihad in europe
2175568 first to establish what they call an ethnically clean albanian republic and then the merger with albania to form a greater albania
2175569 that president bush was walking into a virtual albanian deathtrap in his visit to tirana on sunday where he was to be greeted with bombs guns and the sinister machinations of al qaeda
2175570 family or clan solidarity and by the intimidation of witnesses as well as of law enforcement and judicial officials
2175571 kosovo is a monoethnic state run by the mafia with ethnic minorities living in guarded enclaves
2175572 nato has raised security in kosovo in response to a specific threat of attack against international organizations in the united nations protectorate
2175573 albanians are trying to cleanse the serbs and create a fait accompli before any talks about kosovos status
2175574 one of the most cherished principles of international law the territorial integrity of states is about to be undone as part of the latest western attempt to cover up failure in the balkans
2175575 ever notice how theyre always accusing people of being pro serb because theyre oblivious that theyre anti serb
2175576 the hope in giving albanian ruled kosovo autonomy was that they would become loyal citizens of yugoslavia
2175577 but instead they used the increased privileges to clean kosovo of serbs
2175578 spent years working toward a peacekeeping assignment with the organization
2175579 a crowd of local citizens assaulted him he was taken by a mob and shot dead
2175580 what happens in the balkans doesnt stay in the balkans
2175581 when a meeting or part thereof is held under the chatham house rule participants are free to use the information received but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker s nor that of any other participant may be revealed nor may it be mentioned that the information was received at a meeting of the institute
2175582 we need to put our differences aside and focus on the future together i believe that the world banks best days are still to come
2175583 replacing one bush appointee with another will not resolve the fundamental governance problems of the world bank
2175584 member governments should reject a back door deal that leaves the banks governance structure intact and should press for an open merit based selection process
2175585 once i start at the world bank i will be eager to meet the people who drive the agenda of overcoming poverty in all regions with particular attention to africa advancing social and economic development investing in growth and encouraging hope opportunity and dignity
2175586 russia is acting against unipolaritys accommodating ideologies and politics against its recently resurgent manifestations and machinations and against the instruments of its perpetuation such as the north atlantic treaty organisation nato
2175587 a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 percent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprise and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 percent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
2175588 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the us department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy
2175589 ball presented an outline of the advantages of a new colonial world economic order based on the concept of a world company and described some of the obstacles that needed to be eliminated for its success according to ball the first and most important thing that had to be eliminated was the archaic political structure of the nation state
2175590 ball wrote to be productive we must begin our inquiry by explicitly recognizing the lack of phasing between development of the world company a concept responding to modern needs and the continued existence of an archaic political structure of nation states mostly small or of only medium size which is evolving only at glacier pace in response to new world requirements of scope and scale
2175591 it was clear for ball that the very structure of the nation state and the idea of the commonwealth or of a general welfare of a people represented the main obstacle against any attempt of freely looting the planet especially the weak and poor nations of the world and represented the most important impediment to the creation of a neo colonial world empire
2175592 where does one find a legitimate base for the power of corporate managements to make decisions that can profoundly affect the economic life of nations to whose governments they have only limited responsibility
2175593 i dont think a global ruling class exists business influences society and politics influences purely common sense its not that business contests the right of democratically elected leaders to lead
2175594 this colonisation masked as reforms destroyed the basic institutions of russian society along the following basic lines 1 destruction of the financial system of the state by means of an endless build up of the state debt pyramid shrinking of the tax base deepening of the non payments crisis and disorganisation of the monetary system 2 destruction of the scientific and technological potential of the country achieved by means of a many fold reduction in state financing of science the collapse of technological cooperation and scientific production integration in the course of mass privatisation and the refusal of the government to have any scientific and technical industrial or structural policy at all 3 sale of controlling blocs of shares in the leading and most valuable russian firms in industry electric power and telecommunications to foreign companies 4 transfer of the right to exploit the most valuable russian raw materials deposits to transnational corporations 5 establishment of foreign control over the russian stock exchange 6 establishment of direct foreign control over the shaping of russian domestic and foreign economic policy
2175595 the us can no longer ride roughshod over nor bully nor simply ignore resurgent russia rising china or the globes regimes that supply the vital oil that fuels the us economy something must be done and urgently in order to cut deeply into russias mounting global energy leverage the us russia strategically deteriorating relations are one victim of this geopolitical struggle for energy supremacy
2175596 no us russia military confrontation is likely no matter how tense things should get
2175597 aggressive unilateralist us foreign policy has forced axis of evil states to accelerate their pursuit of nuclear weapons to immunise themselves against us military strikes
2175598 has managed to discredit a lot of our basic notions in the eyes of the afghans
2175599 they returned to afghanistan and formed a branch of the brothers the islamic society later these same professors as they were known would form the backbone of the afghan mujahedin who waged a us backed decade long war against the soviet occupation the three leading professors were abdul rasul sayyaf burhanuddin rabbani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
2175600 get embroiled in a soviet style long term engagement as in the 1980s
2175601 from a five year plan of destruction to a five year plan of colonisation
2175602 a marxist led force funded by dubious sources including drug money
2175603 we see the appalling figures on one day 10 000 fugitives on the next 20 000 and today 214 000 whole stretches of country were depopulated villages are burned down attempts are made to smoke out the germans with hand grenades and gas
2175604 the people were full of fear about the future none of the regiments marched off to war decorated with flowers as they had done at the beginning of the first world war the streets remained empty there was no crowd on wilhelmsplatz shouting for hitler
2175605 if not they say they will surround the village and burn the buildings
2175606 they will do it look at all the other places they are destroying
2175607 this is not a guerrilla war it is a peasant uprising
2175608 it is a movement which doesnt have the weapons to fight government forces but this is a secessionist movement which cannot be stopped
2175609 i dont want to talk about that because the truth would damage my people
2175610 they have artillery and tanks and we have only this
2175611 there is a single fact that controls this conflict 90 percent of the people here are either supporters or potential supporters of the rebels
2175612 no government can defeat that and this government with its tactics is only making the rebels politically stronger
2175613 we did not have a good picture of how organized or cohesive the kla was before the offensive and it is a lot murkier now
2175614 but they look very confused they may not be able to convert hatred of the government into effective military action for a very long time
2175615 now with these long exposed supply lines running everywhere well see how well belgrade can keep its people in beans and bullets
2175616 i believe that simply keeping the troops in the field will bankrupt the government quickly it has only a pittance in cash reserves it cant pay salaries for teachers and hospital workers and it has almost no revenues
2175617 split by the river ibar endless spirals of razor wire and french kfor troops the divided city of mitrovica has become a metaphor for the hatred and latent violence of the province
2175618 northern mitrovica the serbian enclave protected by the universally despised french military is as grim as it gets people live in overcrowded apartment blocks disfigured with graffiti anti nato anti albanian anti anything with virtually no work available they roam the streets like zombies or sit in cafes for hours in a drunken stupor
2175619 is not war in the traditional sense imagine what would happen if we and our allies instead decided just to look the other way as these people were massacred on natos doorstep
2175620 un war crimes prosecutor reports 2 108 bodies exhumed from gravesites in kosovo
2175621 pentagon on kosovo letter to editor new york times november 17 1999
2175622 moreover the revisionists have misinterpreted the hague tribunals numbers the tribunals total figure 2 108 bodies uncovered from 195 sites appeared at first to confirm the revisionists claims but the revisionists failed to notice that there are at least 334 other sites that the investiga subtitle phrase in larger bold font in print version at this point revisionists distort facts and help milosevic end subtitle phrase tors will turn to in the spring when the ground thaws and digging can resume no one knows how many bodies will be uncovered from these remaining sites or whether more sites will be discovered the tribunals current estimate from western intelligence sources eyewitness statements and evidence taken from surviving family members is that there are 11 334 bodies at 529 sites instead of exaggerating the case the british foreign ministrys estimate in june of 10 000 bodies appears if anything to understate it
2175623 has received reports of 11 334 bodies in the 529 grave sites
2175624 actually the revisionists may have been the ones to get their facts wrong
2175625 cohen clearly stated that his reports had showed 4 600 hundred kosovars had been executed
2175626 we are confronting a regime that is intent on genocide
2175627 president milosevic has unleashed a rampage of ethnic cleansing and genocide directed at the expulsion or total submission of the kosovo albanian community
2175628 only nato has the ability to oppose the serb campaign of ethnic cleansing a sustained campaign of brutality that has turned kosovo into a slaughterhouse with mr milosevics death squads burning raping and killing
2175629 the revisionist case could be turned on its head they imply that we should have waited until the oppression turned into mass murder but the point of interventions is surely to stop that deadly downward spiral before it begins the true lesson of kosovo might be that we should have intervened in the summer of 1998 when the serb offensive was beginning we should have deployed troops on the albanian and macedonian borders and conducted an air campaign sufficiently robust to convince mr milosevic that we knew where the line was between oppression and massacre even if he did not had we done so had we matched means and ends more adequately we might not be arguing about body counts at all
2175630 the effectiveness and strength of international criminal justice ultimately lies in your hands
2175631 i therefore urge the council to put its full weight behind our efforts when we ask for your assistance and to be creative in finding ways to bring to bear the sort of pressure that will produce results
2175632 on topics from evolution to the environment to gay marriage to immigration reform we found that many of the opinions expressed were so off base and ill informed that they actually hurt society by being voiced
2175633 while people have long asserted that it takes all kinds our research shows that american society currently has a drastic oversupply of the kinds who dont have any good or worthwhile thoughts whatsoever we could actually do just fine without them
2175634 was kosovo a messy inter ethnic civil war absolutely was it a planned organised genocide no
2175635 an incredible vantage point to see what was taking place
2175636 getting second and third hand stories many of which later turned out to be fabricated
2175637 all the bodies were buried in individual graves oriented for the most part toward mecca out of respect for the religious beliefs of the albanian kosovars and without sign of torture
2175638 it has become such a game for them spin machines manipulate the media and the media in turn manipulates the population
2175639 but they couldnt find the mass graves because they didnt exist there were bodies of course there had been a civil war
2175640 some 13 billion of weaponry had been dropped on kosovo to destroy 13 tanks two or three of which were museum pieces used as decoys
2175641 kosovo albanian nationalists have a two point platform first to establish what they call an ethnically clean albanian republic and then the merger with albania to form a greater albania
2175642 ethnic albania that includes western macedonia southern montenegro part of southern serbia kosovo and albania itself
2175643 they rounded us up and told us to leave they took our papers
2175644 targeted strikes against terrorists and not a humanitarian catastrophe in the making
2175645 see were fighting to help save these people from oppression

2175716 week 2 ch 2 art of the ancient near east
2175717 now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present but painful nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it therefore strengthen the hands which hang down and the feeble knees 13 and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be dislocated but rather be healed
2175718 so satan went out from the presence of the lord and struck job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head
2175719 for his anger is but for a moment his favor is for life weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning
2175720 blessed is the man whom you instruct o lord and teach out your law
2175721 i am the true vine and my father is the vinedresser
2175722 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and god of all comfort 4 who comforts us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by god 5 for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also abounds through christ it is for your consolation and salvation which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer or if we are comforted it is for your consolation and salvation is steadfast because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so also you will partake of the consolation
2175723 it has been observed that he who has suffered much speaks many languages understands others
2175724 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him out of them all
2175725 yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution
2175726 for it is better if it is the will of god to suffer for doing good than for doing evil

2175739 so what has mercedes done well its ditched the iron lung of a supercharger and fitted a normally aspirated 6 2 litre v8 this means you get about one more brake horsepower but before you grow too excited about that i should point out that you get a lot less torque and its developed right up the rev range exactly where you dont want it the engine produces more carbon dioxides too

2175923 no lo escuch sino que lo mantuve en mi mente
2175924 the adjectives used to describe it are many and varied its the only major new religion to have emerged in the 20th century people from all walks of life use it every day
2175925 part of being a scientologist is being responsible for the world around you
2175926 saya berani mencoba karena punya cukup banyak anakan jadi kalau enggak terlalu kecewa karena masih punya stok lain
2175927 kemungkinan ada kontaminasi bunga varian anthurium lain dan terjadi persilangan alami
2175928 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2175929 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2175930 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2175931 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2175932 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2175933 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave
2175934 sekarang saya sedang menantikan tetasan kedua dari 55 butir telur dari dua betina azura dan foto
2175935 setelah saya pelajari kayaknya kandang outdoor lebih cocok untuk kandang hibernasi dan pelaminan bearded dragon
2175936 biasanya pasca hibernasi fertilitas betina sangat bagus tingkat keberhasilan breeding pun jadi lebih tinggi
2175937 kalau kita bisa mengatur suhu dan juga pola gelap terang di dalam ruang mungkin akan lebih bagus lagi tapi tentu butuh peralatan yang tidak sederhana
2175938 semisal dengan mengatur pola makannya diberikan di tempat dan jam yang sama supaya pola hidup termasuk siklus hormonalnya teratur
2175939 makanya saat keluar usai hibernasi tubuhnya kurus kering karena kurang gizi
2175940 tapi kita juga harus beri perhatian ekstra padanya karena tubuhnya lemah dan rentan kena penyakit kita harus pastikan tempatnya bersih dan bebas dari jamur
2175941 sebagai selingan saya berikan tikus putih meskipun tidak terlalu rutin dalam seminggu sudah terlihat molek kembali dan siap dikawinkan
2175942 pilih dua jantan dan satukan dalam kandang lantas masukkan betina pasti mereka berantem dan berebut betina siapa yang lebih agresif mengejar dipakai sebagai pejantan
2175943 tunggu sampai dia terlihat gendut kaki dan ekornya juga ikut gemuk dan nafsu makannya turun lantas dipindah ke boks peneloran
2175944 sang ibu pasti terlihat capek dan kepayahan segera sediakan air bersih untuk minum dan berendam
2175945 saya taruh termometer untuk memastikan suhu tidak keluar dari range 27 30 0 c suhu di indonesia sudah sesuai untuk penetasan telur tak perlu lagi heater
2175946 model box in box berguna untuk menjaga kelembapan inkubator lalu ditutup namun biberi sedikit sela untuk sirkulasi udara
2175947 biasanya menetas antara jam 9 pagi sampai jam 3 sore satu telur menetas bisa sampai 1 5 jam dua hari baru selesai menetas semua langsung pindahkan anakan ke kandang khusuc yang dikasih tisu untuk membersihkan diri
2175948 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2175949 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2175950 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2175951 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2175952 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2175953 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2175954 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2175955 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2175956 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2175957 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2175958 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2175959 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2175960 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2175961 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2175962 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2175963 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2175964 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2175965 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2175966 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2175967 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2175968 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2175969 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2175970 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2175971 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2175972 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2175973 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2175974 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2175975 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2175976 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2175977 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2175978 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2175979 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2175980 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2175981 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2175982 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2175983 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2175984 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2175985 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2175986 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2175987 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he
2175988 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2175989 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2175990 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2175991 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2175992 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2175993 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2175994 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2175995 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2175996 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2175997 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2175998 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2175999 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2176000 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2176001 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2176002 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2176003 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2176004 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2176005 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2176006 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2176007 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2176008 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2176009 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2176010 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2176011 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2176012 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2176013 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2176014 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2176015 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2176016 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2176017 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2176018 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2176019 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness to this enmity
2176020 among the old abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra among the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra among the women ayesha ra and among the girls fatima ra
2176021 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is living alone in the house and is always busy in the worship of allah who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2176022 when jafar al sadiq entered the palace i saw a big python with him his two lips were open one was on the upper side and the other was below the throne the python told me if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you along with your throne when i heard this i was afraid of python and i did not know what i was telling to jafar al sadiq so i excused him and became unconscious
2176023 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart became black
2176024 oh abu suleiman you are also a pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2176025 oh son of the prophet allah gave you such a greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all the muslims
2176026 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grandfather will stop me and will ask me that why i have not fulfilled my duties properly allah will not see the inheritance but he will see the good deeds
2176027 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet his habits are superior his grandfather is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proud of his deeds
2176028 oh son of the prophet you do not need our recommendations because your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2176029 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are living in the loneliness and not coming out of the house
2176030 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not be seen again and people are busy with their own thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2176031 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2176032 the inside dress is for the allah and other one is for the mankind
2176033 the animals can do these things as they recognize who beats them and who loves them
2176034 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and can choose one good thing which is more good out of the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad out of the two bad things
2176035 you have all the qualities of a pious person you have kindness and coolness like the family members of the prophet but you have more proud
2176036 i am not proudy but my lord is great so when i discontinued meeting people proudness and greatness has overpowered me one can feel proud upon allahs greatness but one should not be proudy for his own greatness
2176037 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2176038 oh allah i do not have trousers and dress with me
2176039 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2176040 have you not heard what allah said to prophet moses pbuh that you cannot see him
2176041 his heart has seen allah but other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2176042 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there is no eagerness and passion then allah will not be there
2176043 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2176044 when he was calling others for his help then he was not correct so he was adviced to take care of the window opened in his own heart
2176045 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things so for this saying he will become an unbeliever
2176046 one who commits sin with fear and seeks allahs repentance he will become closer to allah the one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept away from allah one who is proud for his worship he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2176047 who is better a sincere pious person or a wealthy person
2176048 pious person is better than the other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2176049 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2176050 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship the real remembrance of allah is that in which one should forget everything because allah is found for such things
2176051 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2176052 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2176053 one who fights against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2176054 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2176055 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic then this is the work of unbelievers
2176056 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i came to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2176057 allahs heaven and hell are in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara

2176060 i know with absolutely certainty if one remains focused on their vision all obstacles must give way or totally disappear
2176061 perhaps youll find your own lesson here but for me its a personal reminder that people must always come before profits and that genuine wealth comes from honest self expression while david schirmer may have a nice car and house the man i saw in those videos was in my opinion more impoverished than wealthy
2176062 the burden if you want to call it that of taking the high road would be on the gurus and teachers not their followers
2176063 one who professes to be a teacher bears an additional burden of responsibility which the seeker does not share
2176064 when a well meaning high profile psychologist on a radio interview said today that the secert is dangerous and doesnt work and what professional qualifactions do i have to back up my claims

2176107 were really trying to tell retailers that aug 5 could be the most important day of 2008 for them
2176108 in one day they could really learn some things that would help them get through the next year and beyond if they learn to market smart
2176109 sometimes retailers may not know how to go about finding out how to advertise themselves effectively
2176110 so the rma wanted to find a way to put these people together in a fun friendly informal and non threatening way to really encourage retailers to find out what is available to them
2176111 everything retailers do should make it easy for customers to do business with them

2176378 what he does is he brings experience to our group
2176379 hes a guy thats been starting for three some odd years for tennessee and played very well for his previous team
2176380 hes developed i watched him develop into being one of the top guards in the league and hes going to do well over there in st louis
2176381 going against him made it a little bit easier on sunday to go against some of these other guys
2176382 you never really stop learning but hes definitely learned a lot and hes one to teach you everything he knows so i listened with open ears
2176383 hes going to be around for a long long time
2176384 any time you lose a guy like that you lose something in your locker room i wish we still had him but thats the business nobodys going to fault him for taking the money 36 million that the rams are giving him
2176385 im going to wake up and im still going to have to run
2176386 im not standing alone i have a whole bunch of people there with me
2176387 if paris hilton or bill gates wants to hang out in the olympic village theyd probably have a hard time doing that
2176388 being able to do what i do is something you cant buy except with hard work and determination and that in itself provides me with a lot of motivation
2176389 a greater obligation to dedicate myself to uphold the highest standard for both myself and the many people who have supported and guided me along the journey
2176390 i remember dribbling the ball around in my back yard imagining playing for a gold medal
2176391 to see how hard it is to just get into one and this is her fifth thats just incredible
2176392 it is too much walking and waiting and energy used to do that
2176393 it doesnt really sound like a good time to me ill go out and practice during that time should be a good time too
2176394 i thought when i made the team that i would have some sort of awe moment
2176395 that didnt happen i mean after i made it it was like another day
2176396 i feel like im at the point of my career to where i can start over
2176397 i think with the global age we are in cell phones internet etc our sense of the world has grown and we share a larger human brotherhood with everyone not just the people within our borders
2176398 look at all the clamoring against injustices around the world from the american public this just was not seen 50 years ago mostly because of the lack of dissemination of information
2176399 i feel a lot of camaraderie with wrestlers because they have bled sweat and cried just like i have
2176400 youre among so many people who understand the way no one else can how you train and what you give up
2176401 that makes you close in a way that non athletes dont always understand you still want to beat them but you want to give them a hug when its all over
2176402 means i carry the strength and spirit of america with me
2176403 we were just talking about little things and he went into that i just let him talk
2176404 i can remember the first time he walked into the house
2176405 i just had a regular house but he looked around and said am i rich
2176406 the man said do you know how your father became deceased
2176407 i said my daddy is in atlanta then he says here in your file it says your mom shot and killed your daddy when you were 2
2176408 i froze up because when he said it it was just so blunt no kind of emotion but i just took it and rolled with it
2176409 but he wants to wait until he makes it it would upset him too much to see her now
2176410 because of the decisions that she made a lot of people look down on her
2176411 i put the tattoo on there so i wont ever forget about her even though she wasnt a perfect person shes still my mother
2176412 i just wanted to line up they put me at wide receiver but i told them i wanted to get to the quarterback i aint ever seen receiver since
2176413 lots of times i would pass by the school and it was sad to see him sitting out in front of school when everyone was gone
2176414 i went to him one day and asked him his situation
2176415 i took the card but i didnt know that man
2176416 to me it was bigger than going to the nfl getting an offer to go to florida state
2176417 later that night missouri called me and started telling me about the program and how good they did last year
2176418 the beauty of what we do around here is youve got to prove it its his job to win but im encouraged
2176419 i feel as though i have to prove a point because what happened to me was a slap in the face now that im here missouri has my commitment its about going out there and proving the world wrong like the rest of my life

2176488 before the 1906 earthquake most scientists thought that an earthquake involved shaking of the ground but not any permanent displacements of the ground
2176489 what the lawson report did was to show us that sudden movement along a fault a zone of weakness in the earth produces the earthquake shaking in addition to producing the shaking which is what we all feel it produces permanent displacement of the land

2176524 its a preposterous idea to try to win over the heart of anti nationals now you are taking the muslims 1st statement to dizzy heights of secularism by changing it to anti nationals first ill prefer our govt to spend money on dalits starving poors farmers committing suicides and solders giving up their life for nation rather than anti nationals anyway people will not stop fantasizing about ummah darul islam or internationalism just because government splurge money on them even gandhiji coudnt win heart of jehadis and they overwhelmingly choose jinnah over gandhiji the fight against jehad is the responsibility of not only government and security forces but ever indian who love this country there is no point in beating around the bush when you run out of valid points and by the way it shows your color when you say that you will wait for the evidence for people like osama rajiv gandhi but you already made up your mind of modis guilt when all you have is the similar bad evidence you are free to think what you like that doesnt change the reality one bit public also should perceive that justice is done otherwise people will definitely take arms in their hand that is a given i thought that was the message you were giving when you were saying that if the money doesnt reach the unfortunate by trickle or any other means social unrest will come same thing here too however in india people are not rioting for economic reasons but religious reasons why should you be so worried when you are not so much worried about anti nationals such as communists casteist and the real communalist nowdays they are called secularist are tearing the country apart so are the communists stalin mao buddhadev etc of all colors their killings runs in millions not 100s and 1000s where as rss dont as per your logic only since their guilt is not proven in the court they should be assumed innocent you are a vermin of highest order

2176576 epiphany is an unveiling of reality what in greek was called epiphaneia meant the appearance the arrival of a divinity among mortals or its recognition under a familiar shape of man or woman epiphany thus interrupts the everyday flow of time and enters as one privileged moment when we intuitively grasp a deeper more essential hidden in things or persons a poem epiphany tells about one moment event and this imposes a certain form

2176578 since poetry deals with the singular not the general it cannot if it is good poetry look at things of this earth other than as colorful variegated and exciting and so it cannot reduce life with all its pain horror suffering and ecstasy to a unified tonality of boredom or complaint by necessity poetry is therefore on the side of being and against nothingness

2176580 if such a one were to say well what good is it to order ones life according to such a criterion i would answer what good do you think that excuse will be in eternity eternitys commandment is infinitely higher than any ever so sagacious excuse
2176581 without fear for oneself and without regard for oneself to venture into the danger in connection with which the contemporaries blinded prejudiced and conniving have or want to have no idea that there is honor to be gained therefore it is not only dangerous to venture into the danger but is doubly dangerous because the derision of the onlookers awaits the courageous one whether he wins or loses

2176637 het is hier een en al miserie veel mensen trekken weg veel van de oude gieterijen en metaalfabrieken zijn dicht of werken met veel minder mensen dan vroeger en de mensen willen het zware werk in de gieterijen ook niet meer doen er is een speciale opleiding voor gieterijen in het nieuwe lyc e technique van revin maar er zijn bijna geen studenten dat lyc e is gebouwd met geld van europa om de streek te ontwikkelen en nu staat het daar half leeg maar ik woon hier graag er is hier weinig stress alles gaat traag en de natuur is overal ik zou voor geen geld in een stad als brussel willen wonen
2176638 this could be achieved through unity among the journalists and non journalists whose struggles over the years since early 1950s under the leadership of late m chalapathi rao and k ramaraon led to the constitution of press commissions and wage boards
2176639 passionate commitment to restore the rural poor to indias consciousness
2176640 and as a journalist i find the scenario more painful when i see a disconnect between mass media and mass reality
2176641 moreover we have not been able to remove caste discrimination these are the areas where the indian state has failed
2176642 we could very well be part of globalisation without allowing the united states to dump one billion bales of its highly subsidised cotton
2176643 in fact what has happened is that india has traded the interest of its farmers at wto in return for the benefit of a few thousand software personnel
2176644 one gets really perturbed when one thinks what would happen to those displaced farmers when they would not find job in any factories which are fast closing or downsizing
2176645 a few days ago a national newspaper carried on its front page the news about a man in punjab paying rs 15 lakh for getting a unique number for his cell phone but very few people know that today the average per capita income of a farm household is only rs 503 of which 53 per cent is spent on food as this data would not make it to the front page
2176646 today if you go to a newspaper office you would have to pass through various stages of security before you can reach its editor in the past it was not so difficult for a common man at these places
2176647 it is in fact a violation of the working journalists act
2176648 am totally hopeless in the morning and for the last three years i have had to rely on it to ensure i dont sleep til the next morning
2176649 no actually my two kids are in fact not kids any more they actually take care of me my last born is turning seventeen in july and my first born just got his own little home although he is just twenty three so i have taken care of them so now i can live like a queen
2176650 maybe its something to do with me being born on april 1
2176651 after my husband died i went into a state of depression and fell ill clinical tests revealed that i had the hiv and when i was told i felt my whole crumble i loved my husband so much and i still dont think i got from him but i guess where you get it doesnt matter at in those days access to medication was expensive and treatment was thus difficult all i could think was i was going to die but my doctors and fellow workmates at ndola central hospital counseled me and helped me pick up the life again i experienced a torrid time in the aftermath though because people started treating me as though i was an invalid and yet i was in perfect health by then my children were young so i couldnt find the means of telling them but eventually they found out and they have been ever so supportive
2176652 immediately my husband died they was a meeting convened where the sharing of our family property was done although i felt the property belonged to our children for whom we had been working so hard for i did not mind because we still had a house to live in and a car to ferry my children to school but after word had spread that i was hiv positive there were renewed battles to get hold of the rest of the property although they had already got our other house as well as two of my late husbands vehicles it was a heartbreaking time and thanks to the womens organizations and the victim support unit i managed to keep our property
2176653 i had relied so much on my husband financially and after he died it became difficult for me so the kids had to change schools and i had to work harder much to the detriment of my health
2176654 weve got some experience and that plays a major factor even when you talk about athletic ability some of the guys theyve been out there before they know how to get into position and how to do things that experience is going to help us plus theyre a year bigger a year stronger and a year faster

2176707 in our global networked economy and society information is an essential resource for capacity building and social and economic development
2176708 thus in a crisis a general depreciation of prices there occurs up to a certain moment a genaral devaluation or destruction of capital the devaluation like the depreciation can be absolete and not merely relative because value expresses not merely a relation between one commodity and another as does price but rather the relation between the price of the commodtiy and the labour objectified in it or between one amount of objefctified labour of the same quality and another if these amounts are not equal then devaluation takes place which is not outweighed by appreciation on the other side for the other side expresses a fixed amount of objectified labour which remains unchanged by exchange in general crisis this devaluation extends even to lving labour capacity itself in consecuence of what has been indicated above the destruction of value and capital which takes place in a crisis coincides with or means the same thing as a general growth of the productive forces which however takes place not by means of a real increase of the productive force of labour the extend to which this happens in consequence of crises is beside the point here but by means of a decrease of the existing value of raw materials machines labour capacity
2176709 the destruction of value and capital which takes place in a crisis coincides with or means the same thing as a general growth of the productive forces
2176710 in the same way on the other hand a sudden general increase in the forces of prodcution would relatively devalue all the present vlaues which labour objectifies it at the lower stage of the productive forces and hence would destroy present capital as well as preset labouring capactiy the other side of the crisis resolves itself into a real decreease in production in living labour in order to restore the correct relation between necessary and surplus labour on which in the last analysis everything rest
2176711 here however this value is its own value or the measure of its self ngation hegel science of logic we will return to this under profit
2176712 as independent value in a negative realtion vis a vis circutalion is capital withc does not step out of the production porcess into exchange again to become money
2176713 live above the coffee shop 420 utills included no windows
2176714 for the first time nature becomes purely and object for humankind purely a matter of utility ceases to be recognise as a power for itself and the theoretical discovery of its autonomous laws appears merely as a ruse so as to subjugate it under human needs whether as an object of consumption or as a means of production in accord with this tendency capital drives beyond national barriers and prejudices as much as beyond nature worship as a well as all traditional confiened complacent encrusted satisfactions of present needs and reproductions of old ways of life it is destructive torwards all of this and constantly revolutionizes it tearing down all the barriers which hm in the development of the forces of production the expansion of needs the all sided development of production and the exploitation and exchange of natural and mental forces
2176715 supply itself is demans for a certain product of a certain value which expresses itself in the demanded amount of the product
2176716 the simple concept of capital has to contain its civilizing tendencies etc in themselves they must not as the economics books until now appear merely as external consqnquences likewise the contradicitons whihc are tlater releases demonstrated as already latent within it
2176717 in a series of years the world can take no more from us than we can take from the world
2176718 the value set upon commodities that is the sacrifice of labour which people are willing to make in order to sustain them in the actual state of things my be said to be almost the sole cause of the existence of wealth
2176719 the very existence of a profit upon any commodity presupposes a demands exterior to that of the labourer who has produce it
2176720 the very existence of a profit upon any commodity pre supposes a demand exterior to that of the labourer who has produce it
2176721 what precisely distinguishes capital from the master servant relation is that the worker confronts him as consumer and possessor of exchange values and that in the form of the possessor of money in the form of money he becomes a simple center of circulation on of its infinitely many centers in which his specificity as worker extinguished
2176722 in so far as it is only the conscious relation and posited in regard to the individual by the community and proclaimed and guaranteed as law to the conditions of production his own so that the producers being appears also in the objective conditions belonging to him in only realized by production itself the real appropriation takes place not in the mental but in the real active relation to these conditions in their real positing as the conditions of his subjective activity
2176723 but human beinds become individuals only through the process of history he appears originally as a species being gattunswesen clan being herd animal although in no way whatever as political animal greek city dweller in the political sense exchange itself is a chief means fo this individuation vereinzelung it makes the her like existence superfluous and dissolves it
2176724 in bourgeois society the worker e g stands there purely without objectivity subjectively but the thing which stands opposite him has now become the true community gemeinwesen which he tries to make a meal of and which makes a meal of him
2176725 for capital the worker is not a condtion of production only work is if it can make machines do it or even waiter air so much the better and it does not appropriate the worker but his labour not directly but mediated through exchange
2176726 that the relation to his one moment of the conditions of production constitutes the working subject as owner makes him into a working owner this is historic situation
2176727 the presupposition of the master servant relation is the appropriation of an alien will
2176728 the same process which divorced amass of individuals from their previous relations to the objective conditions of labour relations which were in one way or another affirmative negated these relations and thereby transformed these individuals into free workers this same precess freed these objective conditions of labour land and soil raw materil necessaries of live instruments of labour money or all of these from their previous state of attachment to the individuals now separated from them they are still there in hand but in another form as free fund in chih all political etc relations are obliterated the objevtive conditions of labour now confront these unboung propertylyess individuals only the form of values self sufficient values the same process which placed the mass face to face with the objective conditions of labour as free workers also placed these conditions as capital face to face with the free workers the historic process was the divorce of elements which up until then were bound together its result is therefore not that one of the elements disappears but that each of them appears in a negative relation to the other the potentially free worker on the one side capital potentially on the other the separation of the objective conditions from the classes which have become transformed into free workers necessarily also appears at the same time as the achievement of independence by these same conditions at the opposite pole
2176729 wealth present in the form of money can be exchange for the objective conditions of labour only because and if these are separated from labour itself
2176730 but the latter encounter the conditions where free labour can be purchased only when this albour has been released from its objective conditions of existence though the process of history only then does it also encounter the possibility of buying this conditions themselves
2176731 production is therefore always subordinated to a given consumption supply to demands and expands only slowly
2176732 the production of capitalist and wage laborer is thus a chief of product of capitas realization process
2176733 the conceptual speficitaction of capital encounters difficulties which do not occur with money capitla is essentially capitalist but at the same time again as an elment of his existence distinct from him or production in general capital
2176734 largest part of the humanity is reduced to abstract labour
2176735 abstraction from these moments of its actual reality realen wirklichkeit
2176736 absolute poverty not as penury but as total exclusion from objective wealth
2176737 labor confronting capital has in itself subjectively the same totality and abstraction
2176738 in the production process itself where capital continued to be presupposed as value its realization appeared totally dependent solely on the relation of itself as objectified labour to living labour i e on the relation of capital to wage labour

2176744 dan jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil terhadap hak hak perempuan yatim bilamana kamu mengawininya maka kawinilah perempuan perempuan lain yang kamu senangi dua tiga atau empat kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil maka kawinilah seorang saja
2176745 berikanlah maskawin mahar kepada perempuan yang kamu nikahi sebagai pemberian yang penuh kerelaan kemudian jika mereka menyerahkan kepada kamu sebagian dari maskawin itu dengan senang hati maka makanlah ambillah pemberian itu sebagai makanan yang sedap lagi baik akibatnya
2176746 dan barangsiapa di anatara kamu orang merdeka yang tidak cukup perbelanjaannya untuk mengawini perempuan merdeka lagi beriman ia boleh mengawini wanita yang beriman dari budak budak yang kamu miliki allah mengetahui keimananmu sebagian kamu adalah dari sebagian yang lain karena itu kawinilah mereka dengan seizin tuan mereka dan berilah maskawin mereka menurut yang patut sedang mereka pun perempuan perempuan yang memelihara diri bukan pezina dan bukan pula perempuan yang mengambil laki laki lain sebagai piaraannya
2176747 kecuali terhadap istri istri mereka atau budak yang mereka miliki maka sesungguhnya mereka dalam hal ini tidak tercela
2176748 mengingat adanya penegasan para ulama terdahulu dan para ulama terkemudian dalam melarang nikah mutah maka pernikahan permanen dengan niat akan bercerai pun harus dilarang
2176749 dan orang orang yang menjaga kemaluannya kecuali terhadap istri istri mereka atau budak yang mereka miliki maka sesungguhnya mereka dalam hal ini tidak tercela barangsiapa mencari yang dibalik itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang melampaui batas
2176750 kalau umar tidak melarang mutah tentu tidak akan ada yang berzina kecuali laki laki atau perempuan yang celaka
2176751 sesungguhnya allah swt menurunkan ayat tentang nikah mutah dan tidak melarangnya rasulullah saw memerintahkan kami untuk melakukan pernikahan mutah dan tidak melarangnya kemudian seseorang mengatakan menurut pendapatnya sendiri
2176752 ada dua jenis mutah yang berlaku pada zaman rasulullah saw tetapi saya melarangnya dan akan menghukum siapa saja yang melakukannya yaitu mutah haji dan mutah dalam menikahi perempuan
2176753 wahai orang orang ada tiga hal yang berlaku pada zaman rasulullah saw tetapi saya melarang dan mengharamkannya serta menghukum siapa saja yang melakukannya
2176754 perintah siapakah yang lebih patut diikuti perintah rasulullah saw atau perintah umar
2176755 kalau umar tidak melarang mutah tentu tidak akan ada yang berzina kecuali orang yang celaka
2176756 demi allah saya telah mendengar rasulullah bersabda sebelum hari kiamat pasti muncul al masih ad dajjal dan tiga puluh pendusta atau lebih
2176757 kami pergi berperang bersma rasulullah saw dan tidak membawa sesuatu apa pun
2176758 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengharamkan apa apa yang baik yang telah allah halalkan bagi kamu dan janganlah kamu melampaui batas sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang melampaui batas
2176759 turun ayat tentang mutah dalam kitab allah dan kami mengamalkannya bersama rasulullah saw
2176760 datanglah kepadanya besok pagi pagi sekali kalau kalian melihat kesempatan untuk berbicara maka berbicaralah jika tidak maka diamlah hingga saya masuk
2176761 ada dua mutah yang pernah berlaku pada zaman rasulullah dan zaman abu bakar ra tetapi saya melarangnya siapakah engkau berani beraninya melarang apa yang pernah dilakukan rasulullah saw dan abu bakar ra
2176762 orang ini berbicara tentang umar bin al khaththab apakah perlu kita jawab
2176763 wahai amirul mukminin ini adalah perasaan sedih karena sesuatu telah terjadi pada islam
2176764 sesungguhnya beruntunglah orang orang yang beriman yaitu orang orang yang khusyuk dalam salatnya dan orang orang yang menjauhkan diri dari perbuatan dan perkataan yang tiada berguna dan orang orang yang menunaikan zakat orang orang yang menjaga kemaluannya kecuali terhadap istri istri mereka atau budak yang mereka miliki maka sesungguhnya mereka dalam hal ini tiada tercela barangsiapa pun mencari yang di balik itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang melampaui batas
2176765 apakah ia istri yang di sisi allah mewarisi dan mewariskan serta mempunyai anak yang dinasabkan kepadanya dan dipenuhi syarat syaratnya
2176766 maka orang yang melampaui batas dalam kedua hal ini termasuk orang orang yang melampaui batas yang disebutkan dalam ayat di atas
2176767 di hadapanku beredar hadis kami melaksanakan mutah bersama rsaulullah saw
2176768 di hadapanku beredar hadis kami melaksanakan mutah bersama rasulullah saw dan abu bakar
2176769 dan tidak membunuh jiwa yang diharamkan allah membunuhnya kecuali dengan alasan yang benar
2176770 dan orang orang yang menjaga kemaluannya kecuali terhadap istri istri mereka atau budak yang mereka miliki maka sesungguhnya mereka dalam hal ini tiada tercela
2176771 janganlah kamu saling memakan harta sesamamu dengan jalan yang batil kecuali dengan jalan perniagaan yang berlaku suka sama suka di antara kamu
2176772 telah disepakati di antara para ahli ushul dan fukaha yang pendapat pendapat mereka dipandang sebagai timbangan ilmu dan ijtihad bahwa hukum hukum syariat islam memiliki maksud dan tujuan yang telah ditetapkan oleh pembuat syariat secara pasti melalui penetapan hukum hukum nya para muhaqqiq telah mengisyaratkan prinsip tersebut yaitu bahwa hukum hukum yang ditetapkan menurut kepentingan hamba
2176773 imam asy syathibi telah menulis kitab al muwafaqat fi ushul wa maqashiduha
2176774 sesungguhnya meminum khamar berjudi berkorban untuk berhala mengundi nasib dengan panah adalah perbuatan keji termasuk perbuatan setan maka jauhilah perbuatan perbuatan itu agar kamu mendapat keberuntungan sesungguhnya setan itu bermaksud hendak menimbulkan permusuhan dan kebencian di antara kamu lantaran meminum khamar dan berjudi itu dan menghalangi kamu dari mengingat allah dan salat maka berhentilah kamu dari mengerjakan pekerjaan itu
2176775 sesungguhnya salat itu mencegah dari perbuatan perbuatan keji dan mungkar
2176776 diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertakwa
2176777 ketika allah mengaitkan pernikahan dengan naluri seksual hal itu tidak semata mata dimaksudkan untuk memenuhi dorongan seksual melainkan yang dia maksudkan adalah mengarahkan kepada terwujudnya tujuan tersebut beserta sifat sifat dasarnya berupa pembentukan keluarga yang hukum hukumnya telah ditetapkan secara terperinci dalam
2176778 wanita wanita yang ditalak hendaklah menahan diri menunggu tiga kali quru tidak boleh mereka menyembunyikan apa yang diciptakan allah di dalam rahimnya jika mereka beriman kepada allah dan hari akhirat
2176779 dan orang orang yanng tidak mampu kawin hendaklah menjaga kesucian diri nya sehingga allah memberikan kemampuan kepada mereka dengan karunia nya
2176780 dan dihalalkan bagi kamu selain yang demikian yaitu mencari istri istri dengan hartamu untuk dinikahi bukan untuk berzina
2176781 dan diharamkan juga kamu menikahi perempuan yang bersuami kecuali budak budak yang kamu miliki
2176782 dan barangsiapa di antara kamu orang merdeka yang tidak cukup hartanya untuk mengawini wanita merdeka lagi beriman ia boleh mengawini wanita wanita beriman dari budak budak yang kamu miliki allah mengetahui keimananmu sebagian kamu adalah sebagian yang lain karena itu kawinilah mereka dengan seizin tuannya dan berilah mas kawin mereka menurut yang patut sedangkan merekapun wanita wanita yang memelihara diri bukan pezina dan bukan pula yang mengambil laki laki lain sebagai piaraanya dan apabila mereka telah menjaga diri dengan kawin kemudian mereka mengerjakan perbuatan yang keji zina maka atas mereka separo dari hukuman wanita wanita merdeka yang bersuami kebolehan mengawini budak itu adalah bagi orang orang yang takut kepada kesulitan menjaga diri dari perbuatan zina di antaramu dan kesabaran itu lebih baik bagimu dan allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
2176783 wal muhshanastu minan nisaa illah maa malakat wanita yang bersuami kecuali budak bukan yang kamu miliki
2176784 fa idzaa uhshinna dan apabila meeka telah menjaga diri dengan kawin
2176785 muhshanaatin ghayra musaafihaatin mereka pun perempuan perempuan yang memelihara diri bukan pezina
2176786 an yankihal muhshanaatil muminaati untuk menikahi perempuan merdeka lagi beriman
2176787 nishfu maaalaal muhshanaati minal adzab separuh hukuman dari hukuman wanita wanita merdeka yang bersuami
2176788 maka istri istri yang telah kamu nikmati campuri di antara mereka berikanlah kepada mereka maharnya dengan sempurna sebagai suatu kewajiban
2176789 allah swt menyebutkannya di sini semata mata untuk menegaskan pentingnya mahar setelah bersenang senang bercampur dengan perempuan dan tidak ada kemungkinan ditarik kembali setelah itu
2176790 jika kamu menceraikan istri istrimu sebelum kamu bercampur dengan mereka padahal sesungguhnya kamu sudah menentukan maharnya maka bayarkanlah seperdua dari mahar yang telah kamu tentukan itu
2176791 berikanlah mahar kepada perempuan yang kamu nikahi sebagai pemberian dengan penuh kerelaan kemudian jika mereka menyerahkan kepada kamu sebagian dari mahar itu dengan senang hati maka makanlah ambillah pemberian itu sebagai makanan yang sedap lagi baik akibatnya
2176792 dan jika kamu ingin mengganti istrimu dengan istri yang lain sedang kamu telah memberikan kepada seseorang di antara mereka harta yang banyak maka janganlah kamu mengambil kembali daripadanya barang sedikit pun apakah kamu kamu akan mengambilnya kembali dengan jalan tuduhan dusta dan dengan menanggung dosa yang nyata
2176793 dan barangsiapa di antara kamu orang merdeka yang tidak cukup perbelanjaannya untuk menikahi perempuan merdeka lagi beriman ia boleh menikahi perempuan beriman dari budak budak yang kamu miliki
2176794 itu adalah bagi orang orang yang takut kepada kesulitan menjaga diri dari perbuatan zina di antara kamu dan kesabaran itu lebih baik
2176795 saya melihat bahwa dari segi bahasa kalimat yang mulia ini tidak dipandang telah diturunkan berkenaan dengan nikah mutah
2176796 pernikahan mutah itu berlaku pada masa awal islam seseorang yang mendatangi suatu negeri tanpa membawa seseorang yang akan menjaga barang barang miliknya ia menikahi seorang perempuan hingga jangka waktu tertentu ketika ia tidak memerlukannya lagi maka perempuan itu mengawasi barang miliknya dan menjaganya agar tidak hilang
2176797 pernikahan mutah telah berlaku pada masa awal islam seorang laki laki yang mendatangi suatu negeri tanpa disertai seseorang yang mengetahui seluk beluk negeri itu ia menikah hingga jangka waktu tertentu ketika ia merasa tidak memerlukannya lagi untuk menjaga barang miliknya dan memelihara urusannya
2176798 kami pergi berperang bersama rasulullah saw dan kami tidak membawa istri istri kami
2176799 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengharamkan yang baik baik yang allah halalkan kepadamu
2176800 pada peristiwa penaklukkan kota makkah nabi saw mengizinkan kami untuk melaksanakan pernikahan mutah maka aku dan seorang laki laki dari kaumku pergi
2176801 telah diizinkan kepada kalian untuk melakukan pernikahan mutah maka lakukanlah
2176802 rasulullah saw menemui kami lalu mengizinkan kami untuk melakukan pernikahan mutah
2176803 dan diharamkan juga kamu menikahi wanita yang bersuami kecuali budak budak yang kamu miliki
2176804 maka istri istri yang telah kamu nikmati campuri di antara mereka berikanlah kepada mereka maharnya dengan sempurna sebagai suatu kewajiban
2176805 dan barangsiapa di antara kamu orang merdeka yang tidak cukup perbelanjaannya untuk menikahi perempuan merdeka lagi beriman ia boleh menikahi wanita yang beriman dari budak budak yang kamu miliki
2176806 maka nikahilah perempuan perempuan yang kamu senangi dua tiga atau empat
2176807 tidak ada kewajiban membayar mahar atas kamu jika kamu menceraikan istri istrimu sebelum kamu bercampur dengan mereka dan sebelum kamu menentukan maharnya
2176808 akad pernikahan mutah itu tidak sah kecuali dengan dua hal yaitu ada batas waktu yang ditentukan dan mahar yang telah ditentukan
2176809 perempuan perempuan yang memelihara diri bukan pezina dan bukan pula perempuan yang mengambil laki laki lain sebagai piaraan suami simpanan
2176810 mereka mengatakan bahwa rasulullah saw telah membolehkan pernikahan mutah kepada para sahabatnya
2176811 ibn abbas dan ibn zubair berselisih pendapat tentang dua mutah
2176812 di hadapan kami berlaku hadis kami melakukan mutah pada masa rasulullah mutah pada masa rasulullah saw dan abu bakar ra
2176813 ali ra berkata kalau umar tidak melarang mutah tentu tidak akan ada yang berzina kecuali orang yang celaka
2176814 ada dua mutah yang berlaku pada zaman rasulullah saw tetapi aku melarang keduanya dan akan menghukum siapa saja yang melakukannya yaitu mutah dalam haji dan mutah dalam pernikahan
2176815 karena hadis sahih menyebutkan bahwa ia naik mimbar dan berkata sesungguhnya allah dan rasul nya telah menghalalkan dua mutah
2176816 dan orang orang yang menjaga kemaluannya kecuali terhadap istri istri mereka atau budak yang mereka miliki maka sesungguhnya mereka dalam hal ini tiada tercela barangsiapa mencari yang di balik itulah orang orang yang melampaui batas
2176817 dan orang orang yang tidak mampu kawin hendaklah menjaga kesucian diri nya sehingga allah memberikan kemampuan kepada mereka dengan karunia nya
2176818 laki laki menikahi perempuan untuk jangka waktu tertentu dan disaksikan oleh dua orang saksi
2176819 di samping melarang dan mengharamkan perzinahan berkaitan dengan laki laki dan perempuan yang melakukan perbuatan keji juga mengajak pada pernikahan permanen yang sah
2176820 kami pergi berperang bersma rasulullah saw dan tidak membawa sesuatu apa pun
2176821 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengharamkan apa apa yang baik yang telah allah halalkan bagi kamu dan janganlah kamu melampaui batas sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang melampaui batas
2176822 kemaslahatan manusia itu baru bisa terwujud apabila dorongan biologis itu mengarahkan setiap individu dari kedua jenis manusia untuk hidup bersama membina mahligai rumah tangga dan saling membantu dalam mendidik anak anak mereka
2176823 it is surely laughable when the highest awards are showered on those who promote the most gimcrack schemes to make themselves rich at least for a while the geniuses who invented the pyramid of derivatives at long term capital management were awarded the nobel prize for their cleverness not long before the whole edifice came crashing down with the financial community digging deep into its pockets to pre vent too much collateral damage to every excess there comes a reaction
2176824 im trying to ask you what you think but im not getting any response at all but i know because you told me sometimes no comment means no comment
2176825 do you like them if you do try them on do they fit do you still like them if you do get them

2176829 alice cooper golf monster a rock nrollers 12 steps to
2176830 so i guess the most important question is do you know where john despain is now
2176831 the last time i heard from him directly was when he went ka blooey in front of the whole college at graduation and basically called me a whore
2176832 i was told that he didnt basically call you a whore he flat out called you a whore that that was the word he used is that correct
2176833 one thing i really need to understand is why you were attracted to him in the first place did he possess charisma a strong magnetism was he sort of spellbinding
2176834 i know this is going to sound really strange but even to this day i remember so clearly saying to my sophomore roommate way back then when i was just first starting to emerge from my high school self into what i am now my real self she asked me that same question and i had a ready answer i told her he was the safe choice
2176835 see wed known each other since we were kids maybe eight years old ever since my family moved to cameron parish we didnt go to the same grade school but we went to the same church then the same high school and the same college he was mr bible school mr r as do you know what r as are
2176836 you got that right and we were the g ambassadors the boys were royals and we were girls if that doesnt speak a whole damn mouthful i dont know what does
2176837 but then things changed at first not so much him as me
2176838 my sophomore roommate that same one came into the dorm lounge one evening and said pee yoo somebody stepped in dog shit see most people in my circle especially at gethsemane college would have whispered it around the room do you smell dog poo or even dog feces days later they might still be whispering that sylvia or alanna or dottie had been the one to carry dog feces into the lounge on their shoes but when my roommate shouted pee yoo somebody stepped in dog shit i laughed and laughed and laughed i felt like somebody had turned on a light in a dark closet is this making any sense to you
2176839 yeah im following you so sooner or later the safe choice looked less appealing
2176840 i did manage to develop some outside interests at gc i took up tennis started to get fit looked better in my clothes got stared at in town you get the picture got asked out refused refused some more then said well okay but kept quiet about it
2176841 plus then eventually mr safe choice wasnt so safe anymore if he caught me talking to some guy he would turn bright red later not in front of the guy he would say it had been all he could do to not punch the guy out
2176842 then one day when we were seniors it really snapped
2176843 john luther says im going over there and backhand her
2176844 i reckon so but wouldnt you think he could backhand whoever he wanted to without help from the likes of john luther despain
2176845 nah i talked him out of it sometimes i wish i hadnt just let him try then let her date and her and me and the waiters and the whole damn restaurant just beat the snot out of him but i sugared him off i said oh honey this is our anniversary lets just relax and enjoy it and not worry about other people just for this one special evening pleeeeeeeeese johnny et cetera et cetera so that appeased him somewhat still he fumed about it all evening whores and whoremongers nekkid flesh all that stuff so that was that and i sure as hell never went out with him again
2176846 listen at the beginning of this interview you said you hadnt personally heard from john luther in several years does that mean youve heard through friends
2176847 through my parents one year he sent them a sort of christmas card well it was just a post card of some sand dunes but it came at christmas time so i guess it was a christmas card
2176848 i think only that once but if there was more they mightve not wanted me to know it made my blood run cold
2176849 the message was so un christmas like no a child is born no peace on earth just the opposite really more like an anti christmas card
2176850 yeah well not exactly good will to men but biblical ive heard our preacher quote it many times
2176851 if youd paid more attention in sunday school youd know that the first part is from exodus 20 verse 5
2176852 and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
2176853 so where did he get that lie in ambush part anyway

2176892 jauhnya satu umat dari doa bererti jatuhnya umat tersebut masyarakat yang menghancurkan dalam dirinya rasa perlu pada doa pada umumnya tidak akan tetap terjaga dari kerosakan dan kepunahan sebagai tambahan sia sia saja seseorang mencukupi diri dengan doa di pagi hari tetapi di waktu waktu lainnya dia seperti binatang buas oleh kerana itu doa harus disambung dan harus ada kesabaran yang terus menerus agar pengaruh doa yang dalam tidak hilang dari jiwanya
2176893 doa selain dapat memberikan ketenteraman dalam jiwa akan membangkitkan semangat intelektual manusia dan menimbulkan kelapangan hati dan kadang meningkatkan semangat kepahlawanan dan keberanian doa tampak dengan ciri ciri yang nyata dan unik kejernihan pandang kekuatan kepribadian kelapangan dan kesenangan percaya diri kesiapan mendapat petunjuk dan kesiapan menghadapi cubaan dengan hati terbuka semua itu merupakan fenomena fenomena dari kekayaan besar yang terpendam dalam diri kita beranjak dari kekuatan ini manusia sekalipun dari kalangan terbelakang dapat mengembangkan kekuatan kekuatan rasional dan moral lebih bagus dan lebih banyak namun sangat disayangkan sedikit sekali manusia yang memahami doa yang sebenarnya pada zaman sekarang ini
2176894 sesungguhnya di sisi allah terdapat kedudukan yang tidak tercapai kecuali dengan permohonan
2176895 ketika kita berdoa maka kita sedang menghubungkan diri kita dengan kekuatan yang tidak terbatas yang mengaitkan antara sesama ciptaan nya
2176896 sesungguhnya ilmu ilmu manusia yang paling moden sebagai contoh psikologi mengajarkan kepada kita ajaran ajaran para nabi mengapa kerana para psikolog mendapatkan bahawa doa salat dan keyakinan yang kuat terhadap agama menghilangkan penyebab penyebab kegelisahan keresahan ketakutan dan kepanikan yang semua itu merupakan penyebab lebih dari separuh penyakit manusia

2176929 empez una inmigraci n silenciosa ahora va a venir con las leyes habilitantes una avalancha de venezolanos huyendo de un sistema totalitarista que se van a quedar aqu sin un estatus inmigratorio

2176945 there is no cookie cutter approach because no two cooperatives are alike
2176946 each new property has to be investigated and reviewed individually and the conversion must be customized using data specific to the cooperative corporation financial statements must be thoroughly analyzed mortgages both the corporations underlying and the individual shareholders must be examined and the concerns of the community must be considered
2176947 karena itu ingatlah kamu kepadaku niscaya aku ingat pula kepadamu dan bersyukurlah kepadaku dan janganlah kamu mengingkari nikmat ku
2176948 only by focusing on understanding where data is stored and where it is going can organizations better protect information and prevent it from being carried or sent insecurely
2176949 and if organizations do not stop the insanity of data loss congress will be forced to act and mandate new protections for all this information
2176950 had the sensitive personal information fallen into the hands of criminals with the intent of identity theft there would have been ample time to victimize hundreds of thousands of consumers
2176951 the law requires prompt notice to prevent such disastrous results
2176952 the course gave me a lot of really good foundations but i didnt actually know where i wanted to go with it its only been a few years after graduation when ive touched and dabbled in a few things that ive found where i want to specialise
2176953 i think it was too generic plus our uni was struggling financially so we missed out on a lot of things i guess that put out some of the fire in our bellies plus the arts is hard enough as it is
2176954 looking back now at all the things ive done since graduating i couldnt have done it without the degree
2176955 i think it opened my eyes to a lot of different styles of theatre and i learnt you can do site specific theatre and you can do black and white photography i understood the limits and everyone elses ideas it was good to come up with all those creativities that i wouldnt have if i didnt do the degree
2176956 it was good i formed great friendships out of it i guess it was a good foundation degree because i find a lot of the things i did there useful now but really in retrospect when i look at the structure of the course and the amount of content i find it incredibly lacking and disorganised
2176957 i dont regret doing it but when i think of the 20 000 that i paid for it i dont know if we got our moneys worth
2176958 we expected to have more outside tutors but theyve cut that now theyve also stopped performances to the public with funding cuts they cant afford the insurance i would assume
2176959 i am but theres a lot of people who arent and ive found a lot of people left at the end of first year and went to different degrees
2176960 i think they are re evaluating how much its going to cost apparently they were losing a million dollars a year on the course because its not as viable as medicine or law were not financially sound
2176961 the mba made a decision to file a class action suit because we believe we are in the best position to achieve success for our members and customers
2176962 with the possible exception of the banks from california that could also decide to join us our new england institutions have had the most exposure to this massive data breach we believe tjx has more stores in our region than anywhere else other than california and of course it is headquartered here in massachusetts moreover we have extensive knowledge and experience with massachusetts state law which will likely be an important factor in this litigation
2176963 we will be seeking to recover damages in the tens of millions of dollars
2176964 however retail data breaches are getting larger and more frequent and we cannot continue to absorb the costs
2176965 there are significant differences between this case and prior data breach lawsuits such as the bjs cases in pennsylvania
2176966 we think we have an advantage trying the case here in massachusetts when the bjs cases were argued in pennsylvania the plaintiffs did not include an unfair trade practices statutory claim and massachusetts law allows these claims
2176967 an unfair trade practice claim was asserted by the ftc which imposed substantial conditions and requirements on their operations
2176968 we believe the litigation ultimately will serve to better protect consumers
2176969 if were successful against tjx the nations major retailers will finally wake up to the fact that not protecting consumer data is an unfair trade practice and that investment in data management systems to protect consumers and shield consumers against fraud and identity theft is required
2176970 il y a eu des mensonges tenus par nicolas sarkozy

2176983 ive been resting it since hurting it at wimbledon for the purpose of being here and being able to do my best
2176984 for me its a thrill to be back no matter what happens its the olympics
2176985 the atps tennis anti corruption program is clear that gambling on any form of tennis match is prohibited
2176986 all in our sport have a duty to uphold all those rules designed to protect the integrity of tennis and the atp will continue to instigate disciplinary proceedings against anyone found to have committed an offense
2176987 in sydney we had a blast in athens i didnt have as much fun because she wasnt there it completes everything for me to have her here
2176988 im working on just getting better and everything is going to be looking good
2176989 in the olympics the singles and the doubles are the same because a gold medal is a gold medal
2176990 theyre always tough to play against because theyre powerful even though theyre not really quite doing doubles movements
2176991 at the net theyre just standing there instead of moving or crossing or poaching but theyre tall and their quality of serves and strokes is great
2176992 growing up it was like wimbledon the u s open and winning grand slams but when i did win that gold medal its definitely my best trophy i have by far im like carl lewis and jackie joyner kersee and thinking of all these wonderful athletes that did win olympic gold medals youre one of the few that have and it was really cool

2177000 we used to do shows here when we were at uni
2177001 when the audience started clapping tonight i listened to every clap knowing it was the last applause this theatre will ever hear
2177002 gnarly director and actor craig gregory and i had a tear out the back after the show
2177003 none of us thought we were going to get a tv role straight out
2177004 australia produces some of the best actors in the world but the industry just doesnt support them
2177005 when theres no theatre going on youve got to make your own
2177006 you have to find beg borrow or steal everything you need
2177007 the first time i saw the movie reservoir dogs i thought this is not a film this is a play
2177008 this play was not so much about me directing it was more a collaboration which i think is the best way to work
2177009 we are all creative together we get stuff done when we work together
2177010 i knew id be poor and im very poor ive got no money but thats the only thing i do music and theatre thats what i do
2177011 i had to say ive got to go wil anderson wants to talk to me
2177012 dont stop youve obviously got something just keep doing it
2177013 it was so cool cause i was on the phone to my friend at the time
2177014 i had to say ive got to go wil anderson wants to talk to me
2177015 she didnt change the words or anything i cant even remember what song it was it was just the way she did it her facial expressions she had the entire audience crying with laughter
2177016 i thought thats what i do every morning in the mirror thats my dream job just to get paid for making people laugh from something i do everyday
2177017 big rants turn into something funny especially about my family
2177018 mum loves it she loves being ripped off on stage
2177019 i hate seeing bad comedy that could be good but isnt because of bad timing
2177020 that really shits me i think that so much is lost if youve got bad timing
2177021 he gave me really good positive feedback when i initially didnt make it through to melbourne
2177022 he told me i needed to grow up more and get more life experience thats one reason why im going overseas
2177023 its probably not going to be a job for the first 25 years of my career
2177024 i need to apply myself persevere and be absolutely devoted to it
2177025 given that i dont go to the theatre all that often for me it would have to be that you dont talk on your mobile phone you dont send text messages and i would think you dont give a running commentary about your likes and dislikes of the production i think canoodling is allowed though i dont know
2177026 comedy is almost a reverse etiquette i suppose because you want people to be loud and heckle and things because it adds to the atmosphere and gives the comedian the chance to come back and take the piss
2177027 theatre etiquette is all about the play youre watching really if you think about it back in the day you threw fruit you yelled abuse you booed the villains and cheered the hero the audience got involved it was like a footy match and i think thats the way theatre should still be
2177028 if the event itself is interactive then you speak up i guess youve got to go with the vibe of the show because you are paying to be entertained so you are putting yourselves over to them so i guess youve got to hand over the reins and let the performers steer
2177029 like any other public space i think common courtesy is having your mobile phone switched off and punctuality
2177030 definitely the idea that the audience is placid and non responsive is a bit outdated i think theres no reason why actors shouldnt be challenged by the audience to improve their performances

2177061 there is no doubt that republicans will try to depict both men as lightweights on the other hand john mccain would be the oldest president ever elected its also worth remembering that george w bush and bill clinton were both a bit short on experience when they became president
2177062 there is no doubt about that cheneys approval ratings are even lower than bushs furthermore cheney is not in the best of health
2177063 john mccain in particular has paid a price for his support of the presidents current policies in iraq low approval ratings imply that people want change but a fresh republican face could be change enough if elected john mccain would be the oldest president

2177069 john paul murphy worked as a store manager in a kenneth cole productions kcp retail clothing store from june 2000 until june 19 2002 during which he was paid a weekly salary the store was open from 9 30 a m to 8 00 p m monday through saturday and 11 00 a m to 6 00 p m on sunday on a typical day murphy and another employee arrived around 8 30 or 9 00 a m to open the store between 9 30 a m and 1 00 p m murphy did nothing other than make sales receive or transfer product process markdowns and clean
2177070 during a usual weekday afternoon the second shift of either one or two people arrived at 1 00 p m the employee who had opened the store with murphy would go to lunch and murphy and another employee would begin carrying merchandise into the stockroom while covering the sales floor at some point murphy would go to the office to eat as he continued to work by 2 00 p m he was either on the sales floor or working back in the stockroom murphy was scheduled to leave at 6 00 p m but he often would have customers on the sales floor or would do some human resources paperwork
2177071 murphys duties when he worked the closing shift from noon until 8 00 p m were essentially the same as when he worked the opening shift
2177072 murphy regularly worked 9 to 10 hour days during which he was only able to take an uninterrupted duty free meal period approximately once every two weeks he rarely if ever had the opportunity to take a rest period and on occasion was unable to go to the restroom

2177148 more has changed in the world of data protection and identity theft over the past year than in the prior six or seven years combined
2177149 scrutiny of the va breach raised the bar for everything
2177150 theres now an online auction to buy and sell identities where you can even read reviews of the sellers
2177151 this is way beyond smash and grab laptop theft because criminals are learning they might get as much as 40 per clean identity
2177152 theres progress but there also are still a lot of bad practices to be remedied and its not changing fast enough

2177187 berkata rasululloh shallallahu alahi wa sallam memerintahkan kami untuk nikah mutah pada waktu fathu makkah saat kami masuk makkah kemudian beliau melarang kami sebelum kami keluar dari makkah dan dalam riwayat lain rasululloh bersabda wahai sekalian manusia sesunggunya dahulu saya telah mengizinkan kalian nikah mutah dengan wanita sekarang alloh telah mengharamkannya sampai hari kiamat maka barangsiapa yang memiliki istri dari mutah maka hendaklah diceraikan

2177199 a strong contrast is clear whereas in the earlier verse peter spoke of strong rejoicing in future hope here he says that our personal daily fellowship with jesus christ himself is cause for even greater rejoicing unutterable and exalted joy
2177200 joy so profound as to be beyond the power of words to express
2177201 it is thus joy that results from being in the presence of god himself and joy that even now partakes of the character of heaven it is the joy of heaven before heaven experienced now in fellowship with the unseen christ

2177212 qs an nisaa 24 berkaitan dengan ayat ini ubay bin kaab ibn abbas said bin jubair as suddiy dan lain lain bahkan membacanya sebagai berikut
2177213 ya memang kami pernah melakukannya di masa hidup rasulullah saw dan di masa abu bakar dan umar
2177214 kami melakukan keduanya ketika kami bersama rasulullah saw kemudian umar bin khaththab ketika ia menjabat sebagai khalifah melarangnya maka kami tidak mengerjakannya lagi
2177215 kami melakukan nikah mutah dengan segenggam kurma dan gandum pada masa hidup rasulullah saw dan kekhalifahan abu bakar sampai umar melarangnya dalam peristiwa amr bin huraits
2177216 kami melakukan mutah dengan segenggam kurma dan gandum pada masa hidup rasulullah saw
2177217 kenyataan bahwa wanita itu bukan hamba sahaya cukup jelas sedangkan bahwa ia bukan istri menurut hukum syariat hal ini mengingat tidak adanya nafkah warisan serta pembagian malam bagi yang beristri lebih dari satu
2177218 kalau begitu mengapa tidak kita jadikan ayat itu pula sebagai nasakh larangan bagi seorang yang hendak menikahi seorang hamba sahaya yang sedang menjadi milik orang lain padahal dalam keadaan seperti itu wanita itu tidak termasuk istri dan tidak pula hamba sahaya yang dimilikinya bukankah dengan mengawini hamba sahaya itu ia sudah melanggar ayat tersebut
2177219 sesungguhnya allah swt menghalalkan bagi rasul nya segala yang diingini nya dengan cara yang diingini nya maka sempurnakanlah haji dan umrah dan teruskanlah pernikahanmu dengan wanita wanita yakni nikah tanpa batas waktu awas jika dihadapkan kepadaku seorang laki laki yang menikahi wanita sampai batas waktu tertentu niscaya aku akan merajamnya dengan batu batu
2177220 dua jenis mutah yang pernah berlaku pada masa hidup rasulullah saw yang kini kularang dan pelakunya akan kuhukum adalah mutah haji dan mutah wanita
2177221 tiga perkara yang pernah berlaku pada masa hidup rasulullah saw kini kularang kuharamkan dan kuhukum pelakunya adalah mutah wanita mutah haji serta seruan azan hayya ala khayr al amal marilah mengerjakan sebaik baik amal
2177222 inilah akibat mutah seandainya aku telah membuat keputusan tentangnya sebelum ini niscaya kurajam ia
2177223 seandainya ia sebelum itu dapat menunjukkan tentang adanya naskh penghapusan nikah mutah dalam dan as sunnah niscaya ia akan menjatuhkan hukuman rajam maka mengingat tidak adanya bukti atau dalil yang mengharamkannya ia tidak menjatuhkan hukuman itu
2177224 sungguh mutah adalah rahmat yang diberikan allah swt kepada umat muhammad saw sekiranya umar tidak melarangnya tidak akan berbuat zina kecuali sedikit sekali dari manusia ibn al atsir juga mengutipnya dalam bukunyan an nihayah pada uraian tentang kata
2177225 demi allah kami bukanlah orang orang pezina pada masa rasulullah
2177226 jika anda telah tahu bahwa ayahku melarangnya sedangkan rasulullah saw membolehkannya apakah anda akan meninggalkan sunnah rasul dan mengikuti pendapat ayahku
2177227 kami pernah bersama sama rasulullah saw dalam suatu peperangan sedangkan kami tidak memiliki sesuatu
2177228 ayat nikah mutah turun dalam kitab allah swt kami mengerjakannya ketika bersama rasulullah saw tidak ada ayat lain yang turun untuk menasakhkannya dan nabi saw tidak pernah melarangnya sampai beliau wafat
2177229 dua jenis mutah yang berlangsung pada masa hidup rasulullah dan abu bakar kini aku malarangnya
2177230 siapakah engkau wahai jual orang bodoh yang keras kepala sehingga berani melarang sesuatu yang telah dilakukan pada masa rasulullah saw dan abu bakar
2177231 jangan seorang yang begitu berani berkata tentang umar lebih baik kita tidak usah menegurnya
2177232 umar adalah orang pertama yang disebut amir al mukminin yang pertama menulis penanggalan hijriyah yang pertama menggunakan tempay khusus bayt al mal yang pertama menyelenggarakan shalat tarawih sebagai pelaksanaan shalat malam malam ramadhan yang pertama mengadakan patroli di malam hari yang pertama menjatuhkan hukuman atas perbuatan hija mencerca seseorang dalam syair yang pertama menetapkan hukuman delapan puluh cambukan atas perbuatan minum khamr yang pertama mengharamkan mutah dan seterusnya
2177233 engkau ku atas diriku dengan mas kawin sekian selama sekian hari bulan atau tahun atau masa tertentu yang harus disebutkan dengan pasti
2177234 panggillah mereka anak anak itu dengan nama ayah ayah mereka
2177235 allah telah mewasiatkan menetapkan pembagian warisan bagi anak anak kamu dari peninggalan hartamu yaitu bagian anak laki laki sama dengan bagian dua anak perempuan
2177236 dalam kalangan syiah masih ada nikah mutah lain lagi yaitu yang mereka istilahkan dengan mutah dauriyah giliran yang mereka riwayatkan tentang keutamaannya dalam pelbagai riwayat
2177237 telah dirawikan dari ubay bin kaab bahwa ia membaca ayat itu sebagai berikut dengan tambahan
2177238 maka kawinilah wanita wanita yang kamu senangi dua tiga atau empat tetapi jika kamu takut tidak dapat berlaku adil kawinilah seorang saja atau hamba sahaya yang kamu miliki yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tiada berbuat aniaya dan berikanlah mas kawin kepada wanita wanita itu sebagai suatu pemberian yang penuh kerelaan

2177261 vista is consuming more power than windows xp but we have been very focused on introducing more power efficient technologies

2177263 we actively encourage pc companies to customize the default power profiles so that users get the most out of their hardware

2177274 i have been contacted about issues and by individuals who would like to let me know what is going on
2177275 but at times they are concerned about their anonymity what this does is allow anyone to express a concern and express it anonymously there is no belief that anyone has done anything illegal but ive been asked by many people to make sure government is transparent and this is another way to make it this way this is not a witch hunt it is a mechanism for free and open speech
2177276 long term we would like to look at a new facility but that will be sometime down the road

2177278 the study of history is the best medicine for a sick mind for in history you have a record of the infinite variety of human experience plainly set out for all to see and in that record you can find yourself and your country both examples and warnings fine things to take as models base things rotten through and through to avoid

2177295 and what do you think of mr 2fort do you think he really could have kidnapped hydro
2177296 well its a funny thing the two were quite alike on certain scales 2fort was cramped and did not have enough room for small classes while hydro was the opposite he was too wide and perhaps too sniper friendly it might have just been that 2fort was afraid that something new and different might take his thunder but that has already happened now since goldrush came along if you ask me 2fort is a sly old wind bag who does not want to change i did not change much from the norm but i gave a little twist on the former concept while 2fort preferred to stay in his old self i cannot imagine him trying to really do something to hydro but i would not put it past me to think he has done something to win over hydros fans perhaps it was just his notoriety of being popular back in tfc or his success at being a good insta spawn map for the impatient players but i dont think anyone will know why he is so well loved oddly like cs s

2177813 goodbye big island hello maui 11 17 07 doing laundry
2177814 nice huh but we will never see it anyway waah waah
2177815 i kind of stitch it all together since these songs are from disparate shows my narration is a way of sewing it all together into a coherent fabric
2177816 later on there were a couple more projects that he took on with either betty and adolph comden and green or with joey robbins and steve sondheim they were attempts that didnt work out
2177817 but my general memory of childhood is my father in his studio with a bunch of collaborators whoever they were
2177818 they were like aunt and uncle they were around all the time we grew up with their kids i just saw phyllis newman green adolphs widow an actress the other day i went to visit her because i found a fantastic photograph of my father and adolph and i framed it and took it up there to give her so were in touch all the time
2177819 he didnt feel it the movie represented the show that he wrote all of which is quite true he loved the cast i mean he thought gene kelly and frank sinatra were great but he wasnt too happy with the film and who could blame him but my father was not a grudge bearer at all he was basically a very sunny and forgiving guy and so whatever went amiss he just bagged it he just let it go
2177820 it is a terrific show some people think its the best one
2177821 but the score is irresistible i dont really know the answer to why it isnt performed more or well known more it is actually performed a lot off the beaten track high schools and colleges put it on a lot because it has a nice big cast and theres a part for everybody
2177822 you know candide has its issues the book its been tinkered with so many times over the years and theres too much music especially in the second act and if you leave in all the music then the second act goes on for too long but if you cut the music then ah you cut the music but so seeing candide in london recently i thought that this is the best score he ever wrote but then theyll do the revival of west side story on broadway next year and ill probably have the same exact thought about west side story and so on
2177823 im a songwriter and ive been writing songs since i was a teenager but gee i wonder why im kind of neurotic about it all and so i get in knots when i perform my own music or when i sing or when i have to remember my lyrics and its just nothing but anxiety and panic
2177824 but i just accidentally discovered a way to be completely immersed in music to actually be performing to be with musicians to be in the light to be on the road going to rehearsals steppin out afterwards and you know all the fabric of life in the world of music
2177825 so i inadvertently found a pretty good compromise for myself meanwhile i go right on writing my songs in my room where nobody can hear me
2177826 a lot of it has to do with the bands
2177827 when you put together bands like us and red hot chili peppers somebody has to headline and somebody is gonna be the supporting act and a lot of times bands dont see eye to eye on those things
2177828 i doubt linkin park would have a hard time opening for red hot chili peppers but there are times when for whatever reason a band just doesnt want to tour with another band like us

2177839 vivacious voice is an amazing workshop run by an excellent teacher i was so convinced i cannot sing and would never be able to no matter how much i wanted it learning in a group setting was a key confidence builder for me i now know that we all have our strengths and weaknesses but more importantly that we can all learn to sing and perform

2178136 the proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly correct and learn from it but not to acknowledge the mistake not to correct it and learn from it it is a mistake of different order it usually puts on a self decieving self justifying path often invovling rationallie to self and others our response to any mistake affects the quality of the very next moment
2178137 this has got to be a great learning experience for guys like wladimir balentien bryan lahair and jeff clement
2178138 they come up here and see how good you can be to get locked in like raul is
2178139 now those guys realize someday they could be doing this too this is about as locked in as ive ever seen him
2178140 i was just trying to put him away hoping i could get him to swing and miss but i just kind of hung it up there hes been hot too part of the meeting was dont let that guy beat you so that makes it even worse
2178141 its fun watching raul the only player ive ever seen as hot as raul is right now was raul a couple of years ago when he won player of the week the next to last week of the 2006 season
2178142 sometimes when you try to do less you do more
2178143 all i wanted to do was to stay in the middle of the infield with the ball and hit it hard
2178144 he hit the ball too hard to have it go foul
2178145 there wasnt time the ball got to the seats too quick
2178146 i dont know if you have to be in the zone to hit a ball that hard
2178147 the less you think about things like that the better all i wanted to do was get a single get on base for adrian beltre and the guys it just worked out
2178148 id done it with a couple other of pitches like that i just didnt get down enough on that one
2178149 to give up one run to that lineup and not have your best stuff thats scary
2178150 its almost like a memo went out to all the other clubs
2178151 its a matter of not being able to steal with a high chance of success
2178152 i dont like to risk myself on the chance of making an out if the percentages arent good if its only a 50 percent chance that im going to be safe im not going to go
2178153 the thing you hope is that all the attention you pay to someone like ichiro the less effectively they pitch
2178154 you have to tip your cap to him for staying put
2178155 when they are taking that away you hope theyll pitch less effectively
2178156 and if there is an injury or we burn through our bullpen things could change we know who it is but we really cant say more than that right now
2178157 hey pal what the hell happened to you in oakland
2178158 i like to get out there and go five six seven innings
2178159 he had good movement for how hard he throws i didnt want to face him more than once
2178160 there was no question on his stuff no question on anything weve got to get him built up a little bit it will be exciting to see what weve got
2178161 hall of pres liberty boat country bears tom sawyer island shop
2178162 its really been great for us you imagined it but you just never knew when to be actually going through it it just feels so good ive definitely been through a lot in this organization
2178163 i think we knew we were going to be good and wed have a chance to do some things but to be at the top this far in the season i dont think anybody really expected it
2178164 now that we are where were at were just trying to stay grounded and keep it going
2178165 it was just a matter of time but i think theyre doing it ahead of schedule its a heck of a team and a good organization
2178166 we had a great spring and i think everybody was a little skeptical at first but the more we played the more we started to win and started believing a little bit more and our confidence level went up it hasnt gone down since
2178167 every guy has trust in each other theres not one guy in here that doesnt have the other guys back
2178168 we know that the only way were going to lose this thing is if we lose it from within here the clubhouse
2178169 it takes great leadership and great vision to stand pat
2178170 weve come so far this year and one thing we feel good about is that we have a core group that we have under contract control for the future
2178171 we do have a reasonable chance to put a competitive team on the field for a number of years
2178172 its been a nice year so far but were looking at the next decade
2178173 its not a shooting star situation its about being a rising star theres a difference
2178174 theyre somebody the leagues going to be contending with for a long time
2178175 i dont remember what pitch i called but he wanted to throw a slider
2178176 he wanted it to be on the outside and if span hadnt hit it where he did it would have been a double play
2178177 i thought wash threw the ball really well you could tell from the first inning he had his really good stuff
2178178 what he brings to the game is playing hard and hustling and battling you all the way he had two great at bats there in front of me and if he doesnt then i dont have that big inning
2178179 hearing that lets me know im doing the job im here to do
2178180 from what ive heard he was a really good first baseman in college
2178181 i told him to start taking some grounders there because with our outfield and dh situations it makes sense
2178182 this is going to mean that we can use the dh to give raul ibanez or ichiro suzuki a day off to be the dh
2178183 theyre going to want to be in the field most of the time and they will be but this means we can give them a break now and then
2178184 its important to put my name on a position for next year setting up for j j
2178185 theres an opportunity here for me coming into next season
2178186 morrow is out of the equation its time for somebody to step up not just for lowe but for any of the relievers to step up and take a job
2178187 i feel better right now than i did in 2006
2178188 im healthy i feel great my velocity is staying up there
2178189 with lowe its all going to come down to his command and his location
2178190 hes got plenty of arm strength today there were just a couple of mistakes with his slider but it seems that hes been throwing better the last few times out
2178191 the thing is i go home happy knowing im healthy now
2178192 today i made a lot of good pitches the pitches i made that werent good were all hit every single nonquality pitch was hit hard
2178193 thats the way it goes sometimes but i feel like im getting closer
2178194 come over and give me ride because im out of gas
2178195 i believe smoking should be taken out of public establishments so smokers will stop pulling the trigger and harming others

2178584 look at how id is playing on your fears of naturalism to keep your children 150 years behind the secular world when it comes to the life sciences
2178585 since id is used in biology it should also be useful in meteorology too shouldnt it
2178586 lets see what happens when we apply the id philosophy to other scientific fields
2178587 look taking the bible overly literal as a scientific textbook seems to require intelligent design in meteorology just like in biology lets see if it makes sense and by the way why arent the id folks concerned about reforming this godless science with the id hypothesis as much as they are concerned about reforming biology

2178603 i am sure the mpaa will be happy due to the fact they are involved with a torrent site themselves my guess is they hope that you guys will eventually pay them for the right to help them to spread their wares for a cost the mpaa keeps saying that p2p is immoral and can only be used for illegal sharing so how is their use of the same technology condoned if the only use of bittorrent is for illegal file sharing

2178608 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2178609 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2178610 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2178611 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2178612 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne

2178615 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2178616 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2178617 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2178618 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2178619 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2178620 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2178621 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2178622 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2178623 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2178624 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2178625 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2178626 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2178627 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2178628 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2178629 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2178630 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2178631 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2178632 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2178633 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2178634 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2178635 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2178636 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2178637 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2178638 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2178639 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2178640 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2178641 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2178642 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2178643 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2178644 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2178645 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2178646 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2178647 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2178648 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2178649 allahs heaven and hell are also in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2178650 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2178651 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2178652 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2178653 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2178654 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2178655 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2178656 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2178657 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2178658 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2178659 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2178660 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2178661 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2178662 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2178663 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2178664 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2178665 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2178666 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2178667 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2178668 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2178669 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2178670 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2178671 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2178672 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2178673 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2178674 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2178675 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2178676 oh allah you used to keep me hungry and naked like your friends but i do not know the reason that how i have got such a great position similar to your friends
2178677 i will advice you to become the king of this world and other world after death so you should become ascetic in the world and do not
2178678 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2178679 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be
2178680 do you know that who are you and i have bought your mother in 200 dirhams
2178681 allah will give respect to that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2178682 which action will deliverance for this money we should see that it is coming and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2178683 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the
2178684 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things all things depend upon two things first not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2178685 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2178686 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2178687 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2178688 due to his thinking his are visible on his body
2178689 inspite of this condition one pious person who was on his journey for the hajj came to his house in baghdad and at that time he was sleeping when he woke up and told came into his dream and conveyed his message that he should not over look his duties towards her mother which is better than performing the hajj
2178690 he saw her two eyes and was fallen in her love
2178691 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of
2178692 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2178693 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2178694 i have desire for pity on me on the day of judgement which is good for always world is for the some days so if i face the difficulties of this world is better than the difficulties of the day of judgement
2178695 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2178696 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2178697 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i told him that many persons
2178698 his name is ghulam jabbar slave of jabbar so he is walking proudly and at the same time he became un conscious and fallen on the ground when they approached him to see
2178699 once in his student life he saw a beautiful boy with long
2178700 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2178701 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2178702 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2178703 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2178704 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2178705 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2178706 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2178707 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2178708 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2178709 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2178710 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2178711 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2178712 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2178713 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2178714 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2178715 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2178716 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2178717 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2178718 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2178719 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2178720 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2178721 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2178722 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2178723 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2178724 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2178725 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2178726 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2178727 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2178728 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2178729 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2178730 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2178731 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2178732 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2178733 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2178734 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2178735 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2178736 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2178737 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2178738 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2178739 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2178740 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2178741 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2178742 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2178743 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2178744 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2178745 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2178746 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2178747 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2178748 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2178749 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2178750 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he
2178751 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2178752 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2178753 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2178754 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2178755 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2178756 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2178757 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2178758 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2178759 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2178760 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2178761 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2178762 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2178763 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2178764 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2178765 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2178766 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2178767 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2178768 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2178769 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2178770 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need
2178771 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2178772 he rewarded for raising one of his hand and if he raised the another one then we will have given the reward for that hand also
2178773 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2178774 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2178775 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2178776 allah will reward you for giving me advice since many years
2178777 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep away us from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2178778 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and
2178779 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2178780 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2178781 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2178782 if a man busy himself in the worship then angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2178783 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2178784 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say
2178785 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2178786 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy so tell him to put the hand on place of pain
2178787 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2178788 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who
2178789 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2178790 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah after that he reached the house
2178791 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2178792 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2178793 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2178794 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2178795 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2178796 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2178797 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2178798 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2178799 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2178800 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2178801 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2178802 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2178803 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2178804 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2178805 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2178806 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2178807 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time when he will see any defects in his friends then he used to pray for their repentance
2178808 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2178809 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2178810 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today then the old man took me to his house and presented egg and bread when i was reluctant to eat the above food then i heard a divine call in which it
2178811 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2178812 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2178813 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2178814 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2178815 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval in any condition what ever he likes
2178816 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2178817 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2178818 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2178819 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2178820 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2178821 asking for more will cause difficulties to think sole as better will create proud
2178822 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2178823 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2178824 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that time
2178825 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2178826 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2178827 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2178828 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2178829 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers
2178830 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is
2178831 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless
2178832 the best desire is that which will solve our problems
2178833 if you want to become more important than others so for this thing leave every thing you can see all others standing in need of you
2178834 we have created jinn and human beings for my worship
2178835 to sacrifice the and if you can not do this then leave to act upon the sayings of the mystic persons
2178836 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2178837 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2178838 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2178839 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2178840 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2178841 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave
2178842 telling my whole life with his words killing me softly with his song

2178855 we were genuine with our interest in bringing john aloisi to queensland and our offer reflected that aloisi took the offer very seriously but in the end there is some distance between what he can command as a european player and what we are able to offer as an australian club naturally we are disappointed but we will move on and our search for the right player will continue

2178884 recent scientific assessments indicate that as the global temperatures continue to warm due to climate change the number and intensity of extreme events might increase
2178885 new record extreme events occur every year somewhere in the globe but in recent years the number of such extremes have been increasing
2178886 as emissions of greenhouse gases continue to trap more and more of the suns energy that energy has to be dissipated resulting in stronger storms more intense precipitation and higher winds
2178887 weather records are being set all the time now were in an era of unprecedented extreme weather events
2178888 in 30 to 50 years time the earths weather generating system will be entirely different

2178890 climate change is disrupting natural ecosystems in a way that is making life better for infectious diseases
2178891 one in six countries in the world face food shortages this year because of severe droughts that could become semi permanent under climate change
2178892 i do not believe that amongst the scientists there is a discussion as to whether global warming is due to anthropogenic effects
2178893 it is man made and it is essentially caused by fossil fuel burning increased methane production and so on
2178894 the environment is probably the single issue on which republicans in general and president bush in particular are most vulnerable should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue
2178895 after that speech and the release of data by dr hansen on dec 15 showing that 2005 was probably the warmest year in at least a century officials at the headquarters of the space agency repeatedly phoned public affairs officers who relayed the warning to dr hansen that there would be dire consequences if such statements continued those officers and dr hansen said in interviews
2178896 many scientists who routinely took calls from reporters five years ago can now do so only if the interview is approved by administration officials in washington and then only if a public affairs officer is present or on the phone
2178897 where scientists points of view on climate policy align with those of the administration however there are few signs of restrictions on extracurricular lectures or writing
2178898 another scientist from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa had research which established global warming could increase the intensity of hurricanes he was due to give an interview about his work but claims he was gagged
2178899 noaa website said unusual hurricane activity is not related to global warming
2178900 it does not change the need to slow down the growth rate of carbon dioxide and eventually stabilize the atmospheric amount
2178901 western siberia has warmed faster than almost anywhere else on the planet with an increase in average temperatures of some 3 c in the last 40 years
2178902 the diplomatic tension began to rise on 16 february 2005 when petronas malaysias national oil company awarded production sharing contracts to anglo dutch giant royal dutch shell and petronas carigali sdn bhd petronas exploration and production arm for the ultra deepwater blocks off the east coast of malaysias sabah state the blocks which malaysia has termed blocks nd6 and nd7 are partially situated in indonesias claimed area which is referred to by jakarta as ambalat and east ambalat
2178903 according to the indonesian navy the left side of the indonesian ships hull was damaged while the malaysian ships front was also damaged
2178904 the incident occurred when our ship was patrolling off the karang unaran coast off east kalimantan and tried to drive the malaysian vessel out of our maritime territory
2178905 malaysia s apology over incursions by its naval boats into indonesian waters indicates that the neighboring country has admitted it was mistaken in making provocative moves in the ambalat region a legislator said
2178906 as a civilized nation we have to appreciate malaysia s willingness to offer an apology
2178907 malaysia ngembat ambalat elo kualat lagi tki indonesia diperkosa dan dianiaya majikan di malaysia tki diperkosa dan dianiaya malaysia manggil bangsa kita indon liat aja di koran2 malesy kita dibilang indon s sampe dibilang presiden indon negara mana tuh indon ada yang tau gak kekekeke kita manggil bangsa mereka aja gak disingkat2 apa mau kita panggil hei bangsa malesy kau bangsa pemalesy penindas licik penghisap darah elo kagak mikir kalo keluarga encik2 diperlakuin seperti binatang diperkosa dicambuk kenapa tidak orang melayu saja yang jadi buruh kerja di tempat kotor membangun building memang pemalesy

2179060 many u s military men and women encountered some of the most gruesome battles triumphing over some of the biggest nations to maintain the very freedoms we have today
2179061 d day it was the largest air land and sea invasion ever undertaken including over 5 000 ships 10 000 airplanes and 250 000 service men and women
2179062 world war i began in 1914 and continued for four years until 1918 600 000 men and women fought in world war i and of those 60 000 canadians died and 170 000 were wounded men and women fought in trenches filled with water mud and rats
2179063 and didnt see any women over there and we have a monument for them
2179064 how can our daughters and sons continue to spill their blood
2179065 i know it for sure in my own life in my career experience
2179066 and i also know it anecdotally from my friends and colleagues in the business world i know for a fact this goes on in womens lives
2179067 because they appear to be politically motivated consisting of organized feminists who give false reasons for the gender earnings gap
2179068 yes women on average receive less than men but do they suffer a wage gap as feminists say women control more wealth than men enjoy better health and live longer these are not signs of oppression but of privilege which is exactly what feminists would say if men controlled most of the wealth enjoyed better health and lived longer
2179069 feminists do not talk about this gap but would complain about it every day if women incurred most of the deaths and injuries

2179090 trebuie sa postez si azi vreo 7 posturi ca sa nu mi scada rating ul
2179091 i think we should walk faster since we walk far far
2179092 i never thought id be the old woman with cats
2179093 i have never in all my life seen cats at my house and suddenly would you believe it there they were of course i just had to feed them
2179094 next thing i know theyre wrapped around my legs so tight i cant move
2179095 jens done my shopping so i dont have to come in till the weekend
2179096 well ive been healthy for about two years now though youd never know it by looking at me
2179097 i always thought that i would have children by the time i was thirty five
2179098 three of my friends stepped forward and said they would be happy to be the father
2179099 its just quite scary to be having a child with someone you know nothing about
2179100 id really like to avoid any extreme emotional complications when the child is older hopefully ill be in a relationship by then
2179101 im not desperate im not desperate and im not admitting defeat id rather be alone than in an unhappy relationship
2179102 a baby though i need a baby the clock is ticking
2179103 i sometimes think it would be nice to have someone to take the rubbish out or to fix the lightbulb but on family vacations when my brother has his children on our family vacations and theyre swimming
2179104 its just really the next thing i want to do ive started two businesses bought a house built a house studied ive done all the usual things the only thing left is to have a child its really the only thing i have left to achieve
2179105 obviously ill be a lot busier but im not going to be na ve and expect that ill suddenly feel complete once i have a child im quite complete as i am
2179106 i suppose its really just like putting a cherry on top
2179107 maybe its because ive achieved so much on my own
2179108 my whole familys there for me theyve always been there when i need them
2179109 i should be able to handle this on my own as well
2179110 well its not really something you speak to your brothers about
2179111 i cant really talk to my sister about something like this
2179112 i hope to be less like a mother and more like a friend
2179113 pedile perd n a dios de las macanas que hiciste
2179114 dios no existe y si existe es un h de p por permitir que haya tantos chicos de la calle

2179117 he knew he was beginning the process of annihilation of the species it was not just a war crime it was a crime against humanity
2179118 my belief was that japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary
2179119 mumbai is where the action is and the piyushes and prasoons are the khans of that universe
2179120 this the exclusivity makes the halo around them the iims stronger
2179121 a huge majority of our students are straight out of college in india traditionally people finish education in one go you rarely see someone taking a break after working
2179122 were going to focus on deliverables minus certification were not going to get into the argument of what the paper is called were going to focus on what is taught
2179123 economics we think is the backbone of an intellectual course
2179124 we talk about the survival of the weakest and trickle up
2179125 without clashing with the first world ideology were trying to show how taking care of people around the world can be a profitable business
2179126 the big reality is that human nature and the market system go hand in hand but human nature and humanism go hand in hand
2179127 hey poorni u are talking about something that is going to happen a year down the time who knows what will happen by then forget it
2179128 sshh this is not about friendship i do not understand what u guys mean by friendship
2179129 today we are here tomorrow we will be meeting different people day after tomorrow will bring us in touch with many other people in fact 5 years back the people whom we were celebrating our friendship with we no longer are with them we do not think of them or care about them they are news to us our friendship also will become like that in another year this is natural it is foolish trying to immortalize it
2179130 u mean to say there is nothing like friendship then forget it u have not felt it i have felt that with you i have felt that with sri suresh and subbu if u dont want to participate forget it but do no insult our friendship
2179131 ok fine u people continue but i think this is just madness that would continue for sometime and after that loose out steam as ur hairs grey u will realize it now u wont listen to me
2179132 but i am very angry at u and ur behavior
2179133 u have every right to be angry at me i am honored
2179134 nothing it is just that it is not practical and that is not how a friendship works
2179135 i call what u defined just now as a first step towards love
2179136 u want to look different and talk different from others this crazy habit is going to leave u mad one day
2179137 u know the difference between circuit switching and packet switching
2179138 hey moron agreed u are a techie but friendship is not about technology and wacky tech definitions anyway i know something i am not a techie
2179139 circuit switching is the switching done in old telephone communications packet switching is deployed in modern internet communications and ip networks
2179140 poorni love is like circuit switching in circuit switching for example in landline the sender and receiver have a physical or logical path that is pre established true love requires such a physical or logical path established between two people permanently it is a hotline between people but friendship is not like that
2179141 tech guruji can u explain why friendship is packet switching
2179142 in packet switching there is no physical or logical path between sender and receiver sender sends packets and based on the packets address it reaches the receiver switched by so many devices in between purely based on the address of the packets many a times packet drops many a times packet gets corrupted many a times packets are received out of sequence what we sent first is received last and what we sent last received first as all the packets do not follow the same path
2179143 that is fine in internet we experience so many packet drops as internet is a packet switched network for most part i know that but how is it related to friendship
2179144 when two people are friends there needs to be no established physical or logical path between them unlike in love where a path is mandatory between people friendship is all about communication friendship is packet switched where packet is the words that friends speak deeds that friends do these words and deeds carry us across distances to our friends wherever they are there are no commitments to deliver but then there are no expectations of delivery just like our internet sometimes our words and deeds reach them sometimes it does not our friends recognize us by our words and memory of our deeds wherever they are unlike love friendship does not load the sender or receiver there is no burden to have a path to have a path is a burden as it would restrict the number of paths one can have but friendship can be with multiple people in fact very much like a packet switched network friendship is with an entire set of people community it is not restrictive we can be friends with many people
2179145 true friendship is about helping sharing and actively be in one anothers life but it does not need any specific bond or path in between a packet switched network at first looks like a network that cannot guarantee a service but it is not true even when there is no committed path such networks can delivery quality of service like that friendship network also will improve over a period of time helping and sharing will definitely happen without commitments and without expectations it will deliver without any expectations and commitments as the internet did
2179146 that is why poorni i am opposed to commitments and expectations in friendships even in terms of these meetings dates etc
2179147 we are friends we need to in constant touch with each other otherwise we will forget each other
2179148 hey poorni 20 years down the time if u communicate to me and identify urselves as poorni who worked with me i would recognize you i will help u i will share with you whatever i can it will be because i recognize ur communication ur words ur deeds and the fact that u had concerns for me when i was with you if i forget it it may be due to amnesia or alzhemiers still i will help you this is friendship
2179149 you mean to say that we should not be a group of friends
2179150 well u can be a group of friends but ur friendship should not be tied to a group if it is tied then u are making a pool out of an ocean

2179161 i need more education before i make my first offer
2179162 doing the correspondence course without help was pretty tough and you often felt quite isolated as you have no classmates to chat to about problems
2179163 ultimately i dont think you can beat being in a classroom face to face with a tutor but given my circumstances i think online training is the next best thing
2179164 its still up to you to do the work and no one is there to give you deadlines it is really hard work so you have to have to be very focused but i dont know if i would have passed all my exams just studying on my own
2179165 i have been able to develop a method of working through the modules that best suits the way i absorb information
2179166 however you have to be seriously strict with yourself it teaches you a lot about time management
2179167 in the run up to my exams i was churning out a couple of past papers a day and cleland would send them back marked within an hour or so i doubt youd get that response on a classroom based course
2179168 even those who have obtained their scores have serious knowledge deficiencies
2179169 a credit score cannot be meaningful if you dont know that information

2179197 que los pa ses de la uni n europea se pusieron de acuerdo en una estrategia com n
2179198 los ministros europeos de urbanismo reunidos en la ciudad oriental de leipzig en un consejo informal bajo el lema desarrollo urbano y cohesi n territorial utilizar n una estrategia com n para la protecci n del medio ambiente y la detenci n del cambio clim tico
2179199 por ejemplo advirti tiefensee en el sur europeo podr a suponer un aumento de la temperatura veraniega de hasta seis grados mientras que en las costas se podr an temer fuertes tormentas invernales
2179200 la sequ a que amenaza a espa a y la escasez de agua en polonia son dos ejemplos m s de los desaf os ante los que se encuentra la uni n europea a adi el alem n al t rmino del consejo
2179201 el ministro alem n de medio ambiente sigmar gabriel juzg de muy dif cil que en la pr xima cumbre del g 8 se logre un xito sobre el problema del calentamiento clim tico debido a la oposici n de estados unidos
2179202 alemania ser el pa s anfitri n de la cumbre que mantendr n del 6 al 8 de junio en heiligendamm los ocho pa ses m s industrializados del planeta
2179203 aunque en estados unidos son muchos quienes desean otro tipo de pol tica sobre el calentamiento clim tico desgraciadamente el gobierno de washington impide materializar esta postura seg n el ministro socialdem crata alem n
2179204 la canciller alemana angela merkel lanzar una se al fuerte sobre la necesidad de actuar urgentemente en este asunto la administraci n estadounidense multiplica sus signos de oposici n
2179205 estados unidos ha rechazado la propuesta alemana para conseguir que el grupo de los ocho acuerde restricciones m s duras para las emisiones de carbono que producen el calentamiento global seg n un borrador del comunicado que se presentar en la reuni n
2179206 estados unidos todav a tiene serias y fundamentales preocupaciones sobre este borrador de declaraci n al que reuters tuvo acceso
2179207 el tratamiento del cambio clim tico va completamente contra nuestra posici n y cruza m ltiples l neas rojas en t rminos con los que simplemente no podemos estar de acuerdo plantearon los negociadores estadounidenses
2179208 este documento es llamado final pero nunca estuvimos de acuerdo con nada del lenguaje clim tico presente en el texto
2179209 alemania quiere un acuerdo para contener el aumento de las temperaturas para recortar las emisiones globales en un 50 por ciento por debajo de los niveles de 1990 para el a o 2050 y para incrementar la eficiencia energ tica en un 20 por ciento para el 2020

2179218 i feel down or depressed a lot or even most of the time
2179219 i can be going along just fine then hit an emotional low for no reason at all it goes away but it always comes back
2179220 im a relatively happy person but lately ive been in the dumps and cant seem to climb out
2179221 i feel down when i go for a long time without having time for myself or when theres so much going on in my life that i feel out of control
2179222 i feel sad sometimes but i can make myself feel better and i generally enjoy my life
2179223 you take them for 14 days each month from ovulation to menstruation

2179225 we need to learn how to be more aware of our thoughts and the language we use
2179226 we need to catch ourselves in the act of being taking or thinking negative thoughts about ourselves
2179227 you cant sit around waiting for someone to do something good for you if you want something out of life you need to get out and get it

2179233 when it comes to sex for money though the media second wave feminists and voters are quick to equate street prostitution massage parlors brothels incalls outcalls escorts and courtesans as the same thing
2179234 i make the money around here and when you start supporting this family you can have a say in how things are run until then keep your mouth shut and do what you are told
2179235 so what if i did youre a prostitute now so it doesnt really matter does it
2179236 for me the fact that some men will pay for sex with women they might not want their friends to see them with has always pointed to the discrepancy between what actually fires the libido and what caters to social prominence
2179237 so when do you think the angels going to arrive

2179291 uang ini semuanya adalah bagian engkau dan ini untuk satu tahun
2179292 ya allah pada tahun depan jangan sampai harta seperti ini datang kepadaku yang kedatangannya akan menjadi fitnah bagiku
2179293 demi allah aku lebih cemburu kepadamu yang selalu membawa isi isi kurma di atas kepalamu sementara aku tidak dapat membantumu
2179294 aku telah menduga bahwa abu bakar r a telah menyebabkalian susah tentunya seluruh hartanya telah dibawa serta olehnya sungguh ia telah semakin banyak membebani kalian
2179295 tidak tidak wahai kakek ayah juga meninggalkan hartanya untuk kami
2179296 ayahmu memang telah berbuat baik kalian telah ditinggalkan dalam keadaan yang baik
2179297 demi allah sesungguhnya ayahku tidak meninggalkan harta sedikit pun aku berbuat demikian semata mata untuk menenangkan hati kakek supaya kakek tidak bersedih hati
2179298 janganlah kalian menyimpan nyimpan atau menghitung hitung harta yang akan diinfakkan apabila mampu belanjakanlah sebanyak mungkin
2179299 hendaklah kalian selalu meningkatkan diri dalam membelanjakan harta di jalan allah jangan menunggu nunggu kelebihan harta kita dari keperluan keperluan kita yaitu jika ada sisa harta setelah dibelanjakan untuk keperluan membeli barang barang barulah sisa tersebut disedekahkan jangan kalian berpikir tentang sisanya jika kalian selalu menunggu sisanya sedangkan keperluan kalian bertambah banyak maka itu tidak akan mencukupi keperluan kalian sehingga kita tidak memiliki kesempatan untuk membelanjakannya di jalan allah jika keperluan itu disumbangkan di jalan allah maka kalian tidak akan mengalami kerugian selamanya

2179329 a political system in which citizens enjoy a number of basic civil and political rights and in which their most important political leaders are elected in free and fair elections and accountable under a rule of law

2179333 it seems to me that the desire to make art produces an ongoing experience of longing a restlessness sometimes but not inevitably played out romantically or sexually always there seems something ahead the next poem of story visible at least apprehensible but unreachable to perceive it at all is to be haunted by it some sound some tone becomes a torment the poem embodying that sound seems to exist somewhere already finished its like a lighthouse except that as one swims toward it it backs away thats my sense of the poems beginning what follows is a period of more concentrated work so called because as long as one is working the thing itself is wrong or unfinished a failure still this engagement is absorbing as nothing else i have ever in my life known and then the poem is finished and at that moment instantly detached it becomes what is was first perceived to be a thing always in existence no record exists of the poets agency and the poet from that point isnt a poet anymore simply someone who wishes to be one

2179348 hardly dared go into a public park at night to do so was to risk attack by wolf packs of children armed with chains knives homemade guns bludgeons to be hurt at least robbed most certainly injured for life probably or even killed this went on for years right up to the war between russo anglo american alliance and the chinese hegemony murder drug addiction larceny assault and vandalism were commonplace nor were parks the only places these things happened also on the streets in daylight on school grounds even inside school buildings but parks were notoriously unsafe that honest people stayed clear of them after dark
2179349 they had many more police than we have and more courts all overworked
2179350 uh one of those kids the ones who used to beat up people
2179351 my apologies your textbook does so state but calling a tail a leg does not make the name fit juvenile delinquent is a contradiction in terms one which gives a clue to their problem and their failure to solve it have you ever raised a puppy
2179352 ah yes when your puppy made mistakes were you angry
2179353 what why he didnt know any better he was just a puppy
2179354 why i scolded him and rubbed his nose in it and paddled him
2179355 no but i had to make him think i was he had to learn didnt he
2179356 conceded but having made it clear to him that you disapproved how could you be so cruel as to spank him as well you said the poor beastie didnt know that he was doing wrong yet you inflicted pain justify yourself or are you a sadist
2179357 mr dubois you have to you scold him so that he knows hes in trouble you rub his nose in it so he will know what trouble you mean you paddle him so he darn well wont do it again you have to do it right away it doesnt do a bit of good to punish him later youll just confuse him even so he wont learn from one lesson so you watch and catch him again and paddle still harder pretty soon he learns but it is a waste of breath to just scold him i guess youve never raised pups
2179358 many i am raising a daschund now by your methods lets go back to those juvenile criminals the most vicious averaged somewhat younger than you in this class and they often started their lawless careers much younger let us never forget that puppy these children were often caught police arrested batches every day were they scolded yes often scathingly were their noses rubbed in it rarely news organs and officials usually kept their names secret in many places the law so required for criminals under eighteen were they spanked indeed not many had never been spanked even as small children there was a widespread belief that spanking or any punishment involving pain did a child permanent psychic damage
2179359 flogging was lawful in only one small province delaware and there only for a few crimes and was rarely invoked it was regarded as cruel and unusual punishment
2179360 i do not understand the objections to cruel and unusual punishment while a judge should be benevolent in purpose his awards should cause the criminal to suffer else there is no punishment and pain is the basic mechanism built into us which safeguards us by warning when something threatens our survival why should society refuse to use such a highly perfected survival mechanism however that period was loaded with pre scientific pseudo psychological nonsense
2179361 as for unusual punishment must be unusual or it serves no purpose
2179362 what would happen if a puppy were spanked every hour
2179363 this incredible sequence could go on for years while his crimes increased in frequency and viciousness with no punishment whatsoever save rare dull but comfortable confinements
2179364 suppose you merely scolded your puppy never punished him let him go on making messes in the house and occasionally locked him up in an outbuilding but soon let him back inside with a warning not to do it again then one day you notice that he is now a grown dog and still not housebroken whereupon you whip out a gun and shoot him dead comment please
2179365 why thats the craziest way to raise a dog i ever heard of
2179366 i agree or a child whose fault would it be
2179367 but why why didnt they spank little kids when they needed it and use a good dose of the strap on any older ones who deserved it the sort of lesson they wouldnt forget i mean ones who did things really bad why not
2179368 except that the time tested method of instilling social virtue did not appeal to a pre scientific pseudo professional class who called themselves social workers or child psychologists it was too simple for them apparently since anybody could do it using only the patience and firmness needed in training a puppy the tragic wrongness of what those well meaning people did contrasted with what they thought they were doing goes very very deep they had no scientific theory of morals they did have a theory of morals and they tried to live by it but their theory was wrong half of it fuzzy headed wishful thinking half of it rationalized charlantry the more earnest they were the farther it led them astray you see they assumed that man has a moral instinct
2179369 no my dear you have a cultivated conscience a most carefully trained one man has no moral instinct he is not born with moral sense you were not born with it i was not and a puppy has none we acquire moral sense when we do through training experience and hard sweat of the mind those unfortunate juvenile criminals were born with none even as you and i and they had no chance to acquire any their experiences did not permit it
2179370 the basis of all morality is duty a concept with the same relation to group that self interest has to individual nobody preached duty to these kids in a way they could understand that is with a spanking but the society they were in told them endlessly about their rights
2179371 i told you that juvenile delinquent is a contradiction in terms
2179372 and that was the soft spot which destroyed what was in many ways an admirable culture the junior hoodlums who roamed their streets were symptoms of a greater sickness their citizens all of them counted as such glorified their mythology of rights and lost track of their duties no nation so constituted can endure
2179373 the behind the lines team skilled in sabotage and disruption they are usually the first to go into action they are the sas force
2179374 today students should shout at the president and ask why liberal and secular university lecturers are present in the universities
2179375 dont get me wrong here i have the highest respect for islam and i learned a lot of good things about it
2179376 will such muslim authorities at least recognize the acute predicament of centanni and wiig by issuing a fatwa stating that their conversion being under duress was not bona fide condemning in advance any muslim who might now attack these journalists for apostasy from islam
2179377 my rock my rock that heard my problems that listen to me and helped me calm myself has left me i am angry at my rock for not being there

2179388 sesungguhnya orang orang tua kami telah mempersekutukan tuhan sejak dahulu sedang kami ini adalah anak anak keturunan yang sesudah mereka maka apakah engkau akan membinasakan kami karena perbuatan orang orang yang sesat dahulu
2179389 amat mengherankan terhadap urusan mukmin semuanya hal itu tidak terdapat kecuali pada mukmin bila ditimpa musibah ia sabar dan bila diberi nikmat ia bersyukur
2179390 dan barangsiapa yang berpaling dari peringatan ku maka sesungguhnya baginya penghidupan yang sempit dan kami akan menghimpunnya pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan buta
2179391 dan dia lah tuhan yang membentangkan bumi dan menjadikan gunung gunung dan sungai sungai padanya
2179392 yang telah menciptakan tujuh langit berlapis lapis kamu sekali kali tidak melihat pada ciptaan tuhan yang maha pemurah sesuatu yang tidak seimbang maka lihatlah berulang ulang adakah kamu lihat sesuatu yang tidak seimbang
2179393 well this university is definitely doing its part in shoving god out of the academy no need for subtlety either
2179394 je ne voulais pas tre tiquet comme un gros lourd
2179395 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2179396 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2179397 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2179398 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2179399 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2179400 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2179401 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2179402 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2179403 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2179404 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2179405 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2179406 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2179407 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2179408 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2179409 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2179410 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2179411 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2179412 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2179413 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2179414 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2179415 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2179416 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2179417 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2179418 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2179419 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2179420 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2179421 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2179422 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2179423 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2179424 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2179425 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2179426 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2179427 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2179428 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2179429 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2179430 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2179431 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2179432 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2179433 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2179434 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2179435 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2179436 allahs heaven and hell are also in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2179437 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2179438 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2179439 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2179440 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2179441 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2179442 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2179443 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2179444 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2179445 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2179446 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2179447 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2179448 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2179449 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2179450 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2179451 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2179452 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2179453 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2179454 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2179455 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2179456 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2179457 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2179458 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2179459 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2179460 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2179461 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2179462 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2179463 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2179464 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2179465 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2179466 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2179467 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2179468 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2179469 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2179470 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2179471 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2179472 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2179473 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2179474 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2179475 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2179476 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2179477 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2179478 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2179479 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2179480 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2179481 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2179482 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2179483 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2179484 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2179485 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2179486 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2179487 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2179488 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2179489 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2179490 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2179491 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2179492 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2179493 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2179494 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2179495 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2179496 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2179497 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2179498 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2179499 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2179500 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2179501 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2179502 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2179503 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2179504 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2179505 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2179506 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2179507 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2179508 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2179509 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2179510 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2179511 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2179512 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2179513 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he
2179514 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2179515 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2179516 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2179517 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2179518 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2179519 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2179520 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2179521 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2179522 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2179523 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2179524 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2179525 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2179526 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2179527 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2179528 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2179529 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2179530 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2179531 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2179532 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2179533 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need
2179534 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2179535 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2179536 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2179537 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2179538 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2179539 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave

2179750 como voc e talbe of contents 1 imam jafer sadiq
2179751 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2179752 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2179753 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2179754 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2179755 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2179756 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2179757 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2179758 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2179759 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2179760 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2179761 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2179762 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2179763 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2179764 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2179765 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2179766 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2179767 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2179768 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2179769 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2179770 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2179771 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2179772 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2179773 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2179774 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2179775 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2179776 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2179777 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2179778 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2179779 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2179780 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2179781 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2179782 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2179783 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2179784 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2179785 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2179786 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2179787 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2179788 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2179789 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2179790 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2179791 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2179792 allahs heaven and hell are also in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2179793 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2179794 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2179795 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2179796 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2179797 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2179798 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2179799 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2179800 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2179801 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2179802 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2179803 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2179804 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2179805 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2179806 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2179807 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2179808 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2179809 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2179810 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2179811 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2179812 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2179813 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2179814 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2179815 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2179816 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2179817 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2179818 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2179819 whoever like the following three things for him hell will be near to nerve of his neck
2179820 take me to that person so that i can see him
2179821 oh man the shroud and the grave has kept you away from the allah and these two things are disturbing on your way
2179822 safety is in loneliness the person who is single and alone and who do not think about others in his heart is safe and secured because it is not good to think about others in loneliness satan devil will run away when two persons meet each other
2179823 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2179824 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2179825 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2179826 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2179827 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2179828 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2179829 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2179830 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2179831 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2179832 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2179833 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2179834 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2179835 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2179836 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2179837 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2179838 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall
2179839 it was reported that a fire worshipper once imprisoned him
2179840 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2179841 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2179842 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2179843 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2179844 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2179845 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2179846 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2179847 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2179848 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2179849 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2179850 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2179851 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2179852 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2179853 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2179854 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2179855 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2179856 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2179857 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2179858 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2179859 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2179860 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2179861 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2179862 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2179863 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2179864 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2179865 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2179866 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2179867 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2179868 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2179869 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2179870 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2179871 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2179872 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2179873 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2179874 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him
2179875 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2179876 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2179877 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2179878 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2179879 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2179880 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2179881 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2179882 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2179883 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2179884 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2179885 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2179886 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2179887 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2179888 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2179889 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2179890 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2179891 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2179892 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2179893 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2179894 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need
2179895 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2179896 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2179897 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2179898 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2179899 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2179900 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave
2179901 i have not seen such a flood in the river kaveri in the first week of may ever in my life oh treacherous of mysore you should have waited for one more day as the god was willing to help us but you have missed that chance on that day if you had not opened the doors of srirangapatnam then we could have defeated the enemy without wasting our single bullet
2179902 oh my friends for this day the sultan was waiting how unfortunate we are that the clouds which would have witnessed our success they are washing the tears of our defeated soldiers
2179903 of the 89 applications made between 1984 and 2003 16 applications were allowed 29 applications were dismissed and 39 postponed
2179904 omg im such a dork but im going to go ahead and give him my number
2179905 its great that the west of scotland now has some young golfing talent coming through the ranks and it certainly was a delight to watch
2179906 when i play a 5 wood and the youngsters play an 8 iron i think it is perhaps the time to take up tiddly winks or something
2179907 more sleep could be the ideal way of stabilising weight or slimming
2179908 we have shown that less sleep two four hour nights caused an 18 percent loss of appetite cutting leptin and a 28 percent increase of appetite causing grehlin
2179909 which for a young sedentary adult of normal weight could lead to a major amount of added weight
2179910 our analysis of the data shows a clear association between sleep duration and the risk for overweight or obesity in children the risk declined with more sleep
2179911 desirable sleep behavior may be an important low cost means for preventing childhood obesity and should be considered in future intervention studies
2179912 you know guys i love you sooo much and if anything ever happened to you and god called you to heaven i would be crazy hurt i would go crazy but eventually eventually i would be fine
2179913 the natural is to grow older and grown children to bury their parents that is natural for the cycle of life
2179914 its like god was speaking to us it brings me comfort to know that and i understand that god allows things to happen with a purpose
2179915 its not natural but god allows things to happen with a purpose
2179916 well mom lets just say i had to run to the bathroom shortly after
2179917 then you deserve to be sick and maybe next time youll learn

2179926 heather you cannot make decisions based on fear you cant make decision out of fear that a certain person will get mad or angry with you its not good for you or for the other person
2179927 the fear of man will prove to be a snare but whoever trusts in the lord is safe
2179928 i can swim just watch me at www infantswim com
2179929 all work and no play makes a pahn a loser
2179930 i have a boring day and nothing much to share today
2179931 honestly ladies if a guy loves you they surely are going to be weak no matter how thought they are
2179932 good deeds pave the road over which the good news travels
2179933 if dcc picked up and left how would the city feel would anybody even notice would anybody care
2179934 go on just do it because the only way to learn to swim is by jumping in the pool
2179935 embracing the vision of being an externally focused church is more than creating a ministry or task force to decide how or what should be done being an externally focused church means helping the christians in your church see in a new way it is about encouraging them to see their world workplace and neighborhood as places in which to demonstrate gods love it is about helping to open their eyes to the opportunities around them
2179936 an external focus in not a tactic or strategy it is a transformation
2179937 ministry and service are not programs reserved for a few extraordinarily dedicated indviduals but are woven into every aspect of church life
2179938 what would our community think if deer creek was no longer here
2179939 i knew that somebody needed to get to new hampshire and protect or find out what theyre doing with chain of custody of the ballots new hampshire has the memory cards for 81 per cent of its votes counted by this one company we found there was a convicted felon involved in that thats why i wanted to see what the chain of custody was
2179940 the problem was we were either not getting answers or we were getting bizarre answers
2179941 she kept asking him and ultimately he had to admit he didnt know where they were and this is days after the election
2179942 i then came in the next day and asked the assistant secretary of state david scanlan what about that slit in the end of the box
2179943 you can rip it on and off on and off
2179944 we caught them meeting up with a green jeep in the middle of nowhere half way through their route and we walk up to them and they drive off in a different direction
2179945 i wanted to see what the ballots looked like when butch and hoppy take them off the truck well sure enough they didnt have seals on them and some of them werent even closed they had the box top open with big gashes and tears in them
2179946 every way that it could break down it seemed to have broken down
