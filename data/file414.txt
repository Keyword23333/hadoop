4140022 weve always practiced that way for 28 years and i can honestly tell you i have never lost a quarterback in practice we havent lost that many in games either not to that weve had guys tear their knee up or something like that i think if you went back and looked at it youd find dropback quarterbacks get hit a hell of lot harder than these guys
4140023 weve practiced 17 days and we havent had a quarterback miss a day of practice a guy gets a bruise on his shoulder and were going to change the way we practice how does georgia practice theyve lost a bunch of guys havent they

4140043 in 2006 the uk lost its position as one of worlds top five centres of innovation for the first time in nearly 30 years
4140044 wipos world intellectual property organisation figures for 2007 show that although the uk remains in sixth position the good news is that its rate of growth for international patent applications has picked up well and is now ahead of major competitors japan and usa if this is sustained we except to see the uk back as one of the worlds top five innovating economies within three years

4140049 m sica ecuatoriana para d os tr os y solos de guitarra
4140050 el concierto cubri las expectativas de calidad de expresi n de fuerza de din mica y de musicalidad creo que se present un programa innovador ecuatoriano al ciento por ciento digno de exportarlo y que el ecuador debe conocerlo m s el problema es el p blico que no da valor a lo nuestro me parece que todav a no est preparado para este tipo de eventos no responde con el debido entusiasmo por lo que estamos pensando en la posibilidad de hacer conciertos en los barrios populares de quito esto est dentro de los proyectos para el a o 2007 inclusive se est proyectando presentar la cantata al quince de noviembre
4140051 creo que al fin contamos con un concierto de factura ecuatoriana nos dice con una estructura musical grande completamente elaborada elevada y con un profundo contenido arm nico y de contrapunto musical digno de presentarse en cualquier lugar del mundo es una retrospectiva musical que recoge la mayor a de la producci n de mi carrera art stica como arreglista y compositor pues siempre me he preocupado de hacer arreglos de la m sica ecuatoriana que es una mina una fuente de inagotable riqueza de la que me he valido para recrear los temas y transformarlos en obras para ser interpretadas en solos de guitarra creo que ese es uno de los m ritos de mi trabajo musical y como investigador el m rito ha sido el de recuperar muchos temas que pod an haberse perdido para transformarlos en obras de concierto que servir n para el deleite de las futuras generaciones y quedar n tambi n para que los guitarristas del mundo puedan interpretar la m sica del ecuador
4140052 lamentablemente en el ecuador estas empresas son parte de la globalizaci n y del sistema neoliberal por lo que solamente dan importancia a todo lo que viene de afuera pero no tienen ning n contacto con nuestra identidad parecer a que ellos estimulan lo que no es ecuatoriano son empresas ecuagringas extranjerizantes que no dan valor a lo que tiene esencia nacional y peor si tiene alg n mensaje social con sus tent culos controlan la actividad cultural en el ecuador es una red que influye lamentablemente hasta en los medios de comunicaci n que est n subordinados a estas mafias a estas redes que no permiten la apertura a los artistas nacionales aunque tengan prestigio pero si viene un artista extranjero entonces le abren los espacios de prensa radio y televisi n
4140053 porque ofrece una variedad de timbres sonoros pues la guitarra sola en d o o tr o tiene una expresi n tenue y d bil pero se agranda cuando se hace un ensamble como el de quito que fue la parte esencial del concierto justamente para demostrar al p blico que se pueden interpretar ocho guitarras exactamente como si fueran una sola causando ese efecto grandioso de las cuerdas he recibido muchas felicitaciones por el efecto que produjo el ensamble de guitarras de quito compuesto por maestros de gran calidad este concierto es digno de presentarse en nueva york par s londres o en el col n de buenos aires ojal tenga la oportunidad de presentar el ensamble el pr ximo a o en salas de concierto y en otros lugares de la ciudad de quito ya que es un espect culo cultural que deber a llevarse como un emblema como un s mbolo de la ecuatorianidad
4140054 the incentives are right certification tests would provide all employers with valuable trustworthy information about job applicants they would benefit young people who cannot or do not want to attend a traditional four year college they would be welcomed by the growing post secondary online educational industry which cannot offer the halo effect of a ba from a traditional college but can realistically promise their students good training for a certification test as good as they are likely to get at a traditional college for a lot less money and in a lot less time certification tests would disadvantage just one set of people students who have gotten into well known traditional schools but who are coasting through their years in college and would score poorly on a certification test disadvantaging them is an outcome devoutly to be wished

4140068 i admire him for taking on a tough issue and frankly i wish the other side would come up with some ideas it seems that you know its just a matter of criticizing the president or criticizing what were trying to do but you know in my campaign for the senate i talked a lot about the personal savings account
4140069 dole who campaigned on creating privately managed social security accounts is steadfast in her support of the presidents plan
4140070 as an example of the rare politician who won office while pledging to change social security
4140071 social security is a retirement program not an investment plan
4140072 social security is a retirement program not an investment plan it provides security not earnings president bush and mrs dole would change that by allowing workers to put some of their social security taxes into investment accounts taking the money from social security creates two problems first where would the money come from the second problem if an investment account does poorly what happens to retirees already living on a meager pension the average social security recipient gets about 800 a month its possible to create modest investment accounts and still protect retirees but it wont be cost free
4140073 said she took risky stands during her 2002 senate campaign including support for partial privatization of social security because she thought it was right
4140074 republicans regularly point to sen elizabeth doles campaign in 2002 as evidence of the shift on social security attacked as an advocate of privatization she held up a blank sheet of paper and told her audiences it represented her rivals plan to fix the systems ailing finances
4140075 never ran away from her support of social security reforms
4140076 dole would let taxpayers invest some of their social security contributions in the stock market

4140082 collegehumor has a rapidly growing fan base and bitgravitys highly scalable platform is exactly what we needed to deliver the highest quality video and user experience
4140083 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
4140084 rarely do leaders grasp the extent to which a heavy load of new debt will change the way they view the world
4140085 should avoid acquisitions that include highly leveraged acquiring firms or target firms or that will require significant new debt

4140138 materials and physical methods which will produce amnesia for events preceding and during their use
4140139 substances which alter personality structure in such a way that the tendency of the recipient to become dependent upon another person is enhanced
4140140 substances which will lower the ambition and general working efficiency of men
4140141 we must remember to thank the cia and the army for lsd
4140142 they invented lsd to control people and what it did was give us freedom
4140143 breaking down of ongoing patterns of the patients behavior by means of particularly intensive electroshocks
4140144 we are sufficiently ineffective so our findings can be published
4140145 i cannot be positive that they never found a technique to control people
4140146 a surprising number of counterculture veterans endorsed the notion that the cia disseminated street acid en masse to deflate the political potency of the youth rebellion
4140147 by magnifying the impulse toward revolutionism out of context acid sped up the process by which the movement became unglued
4140148 the use of lsd among young people in the u s reached a peak in the late 1960s shortly after the cia initiated a series of covert operations designed to disrupt discredit and neutralize the new left was this merely a historical coincidence or did the agency actually take steps to promote the illicit acid trade
4140149 that he was employed by an american intelligence agency that wanted to see more psychedelic drugs on the street
4140150 all existing copies of a of a classified cia manual titled lsd some un psychedelic implications
4140151 impossible to impose ones will on another person as in hypnosis even when the strongest dose of mescaline had been given
4140152 even the most intimate secrets from the subject when questions where cleverly put
4140153 sentiments of hatred and revenge were exposed in every case
4140154 after a long and continuous use of chemicals after the subject had vomited and after apparently a maximum tolerance point had been reached with the chemicals
4140155 were now convinced that we can maintain a subject in a controlled state for a much longer period of time that we heretofore had believed possible furthermore we feel that by use of certain chemicals or combinations we can in a very high percentage of cases produce relevant information
4140156 to justify giving the green light to operational use of the techniques
4140157 broad and comprehensive involving both domestic and overseas activities and taking into consideration the programs and objectives of other departments principally the military services
4140158 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free
4140159 produced free and spontaneous speech within two days in mute schizophrenics
4140160 it is possible that such a drug could be gotten into the general circulation of subject without surgery hypodermic or feeding
4140161 frequently used by police and intelligence officers on a routine basis emphasis added
4140162 can be useful in reverse because of the stresses produced when they are withdrawn from those who are addicted to their use
4140163 on the conscious suppression of experimental or non threat secrets
4140164 that drugs are already on hand and new ones are being produced that can destroy integrity and make indiscreet the most dependable individual
4140165 at least 12 human subjects of not too high mentality
4140166 told only that a new drug was being tested and promised that nothing serious or dangerous would happen to them during the intoxication they realized something was happening but were never told exactly what
4140167 he gave all the details of the secret and after the effects of the lsd had worn off the officer had no knowledge of revealing the information complete amnesia
4140168 for eliciting true nd accurate statements from subjects under its influence during interrogation
4140169 we had thought at first this was the secret that was going to unlock the universe
4140170 was that such minute quantities had such a terrible effect
4140171 serious mental confusion and render the mind temporarily susceptible to suggestion
4140172 since information obtained from a person in a psychotic state would be unrealistic bizarre and extremely difficult to assess the self administration of lsd 25 which is effective in minute doses might in special circumstances offer an operative temporary protection against interrogation emphasis added
4140173 it must be assumed that the scientists of the ussr are thoroughly cognizant of the strategic importance of this powerful new drug and are capable of producing it at any time
4140174 but if you ask me to prove it ive never seen any direct proof of it
4140175 to produce anxiety or terror in medically unsophisticated subjects unable to distinguish drug induced psychosis from actual insanity
4140176 confined merely to male volunteer trainee personnel but that it should be broadened to include all components of the agency
4140177 lsd and mescaline disorganize the psychic integration of the individual
4140178 if the concept of contaminating a citys water supply seems or in actual fact is found to be far fetched this is by no means certain there is still the possibility of contaminating say the water supply of a bomber base or more easily still that of a battleship our current work contains the strong suggestion that lsd 25 will produce hysteria unaccountable laughing anxiety terror it requires little imagination to realize what the consequences might be if a battleships crew were so affected
4140179 open the mind to the power of suggestion to a degree never hitherto dreamed possible
4140180 had become very large or had shrunk to the size of children their hands of feet did not seem to be their own and sometimes took on the appearance of animal paws they reported many fantasies or dreamlike states in which they seemed to be elsewhere fantastic experiences such as trips to the moon or living in gorgeous castles were occassionally reported

4140208 the dream we have cherished for more than thirty years of seeing racial hygiene converted into action has become reality
4140209 the most important american political event in those preparations for hitler was the infamous third international congress on eugenics held at new yorks american museum of natural history august 21 23 1932 supervised by the international federation of eugenics societies
4140210 the congress proceedings were dedicated to averell harrimans mother she had paid for the founding of the race science movement in america back in 1910 building the eugenics record office as a branch of the galton national laboratory in london
4140211 averell harriman personally arranged with the walker bush hamburg amerika line to transport nazi ideologues from germany to new york for this meeting

4140219 dr joseph mengele of auschwitz notoriety was the principle developer of the mk ultra and monarch mind control programs mengele and hundreds of other high ranking nazis were secretly moved into the united states and south america in the aftermath of world war ii in an operation designated paperclip the nazis continued their work in developing mind control and rocketry technologies in secret underground military bases the only thing we were told about was the rocketry work with former nazi star celebrities like warner von braun the killers torturers and mutilators of innocent human beings were kept discretely out of sight but busy in their underground military facilities which soon became home to thousands upon thousands of kidnapped american children snatched off the streets and placed into iron bar cages stacked from floor to ceiling these children would be used to further refine and perfect mengeles mind control technologies these children at least the ones who survived the training would become future mind controlled slaves who could be used for anything from sexual blackmail to assassinations

4140296 russia accused georgia of killing more than 2000 people mostly civilians in south ossetia
4140297 because large areas of georgia are too dangerous for journalists to enter to assess the true scope of the damage

4140301 must tell mr putin in the clearest possible terms that such aggression will not be tolerated
4140302 need to take a hard look at their relationship with russia going forward russia needs to behave responsibly and the united states and europe must make clear that anything less is unacceptable
4140303 stand together and make clear that this aggression will not stand

4140307 the war in georgia is a war for the west
4140308 waging all out war on my country thats not of georgias making nor its choice the kremlin designed this war its a war about georgias independence and future and about the future of freedom in europe

4140321 like a number of classical music compositions barbers adagio is better known not as a singularly great piece of music but as the hauntingly brooding melancholy back ground music in the platoon
4140322 you never are in any doubt about what this piece is about theres a kind of sadness and poetry about it it has a melodic gesture that reaches an arch like a big sigh and then exhales and fades off into nothingness
4140323 let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need
4140324 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4140325 a brutal dictator with ties to terrorism will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states
4140326 apparently its okay for george bush to take this nation to war on a lie to be responsible criminally responsible for well over 100 000 deaths but its not okay to prosecute him not only isnt it okay to prosecute him it isnt even okay to talk about prosecuting him this is unbelievable whats going on in this country how can we have a country where they permit a president to do what he did and they do absolutely nothing to him except to try to protect him
4140327 i heard your book on tape and im now convinced that george bush deceived congress
4140328 ive already bought several copies of your book and ive passed them out to colleagues and i told them read the book
4140329 there may be as many as one million victims not one victim but one million victims in their cold graves right now decomposing as a result of george bushs monumental crime
4140330 what person in authority on the face of this globe is representing these one million people in their graves fighting to bring about justice for them pursuing the person the guilty person who put them there
4140331 no you didnt hear what i said i said what person in authority is going after the killer of these million people
4140332 i dont have the authority of an emaciated moth i dont have any authority
4140333 i agree that he should bush should be prosecuted for murder and i hope he is prosecuted for murder
4140334 mr bugliosi come november im going to be out in the public with you and i want to be at your side when george bush hopefully is indicted for first degree murder
4140335 i support you and i want bush to be prosecuted for first degree murder
4140336 is there someone out there that i dont know about thats come forward
4140337 well yeah a lot of people are angry but they dont have the courage to do anything about it
4140338 if this is not a proper case of imposition of the death penalty no case ever would be
4140339 if youre not willing to come back with a verdict of death in this case then we should abolish the death penalty in the state of california how many people would you have to kill to get the death penalty
4140340 laura and i are having the time of our lives
4140341 im going to have lunch with secretary of state rice talk a little business take a little nap im reading an elmore leonard book right now knock off a little elmore leonard this afternoon go fishing with my man barney
4140342 have a light dinner and then head for the ballgame
4140343 no you son of a b if i may call you that mr president youre not going to have a perfect day or i should say youre not going to have another perfect day for as long as you live if i have anything to say about it because im going to put a thought in your mind of prosecution that youre going to take with you to your grave its the least i can do for the thousands of young american soldiers that came back from your war in a box or a jar of ashes and for the thousands upon thousands of innocent iraqi men women children and babies who died horrible deaths because of your war thats the least i can do
4140344 reclaiming history for one week was a best seller that was a book that you know weighed seven and a half pounds and cost 57
4140345 oh yeah i know vince weve had him on the show hes a good guest whats the new book
4140346 well let me get back to you on this this may be a little difficult
4140347 mr bugliosi are you sure you want to publish this book
4140348 vince i cant find any audio company in america that will do the audio on the book
4140349 mr bugliosi the reason theyre not having you on television is because of who you are
4140350 if some nut wrote a book with a title like this the prosecution of george w bush for murder we would probably have him on because its colorful its entertaining it doesnt mean anything it doesnt go anywhere but youre a very serious person and you write very serious books
4140351 vince come on this is incredible youve been essentially blacked out by the mainstream media and youre still a new york times best seller
4140352 i guess this is just this is what happens during a war
4140353 if you hear about a hundred innocent iraqi civilians in a mosque or a market blown to pieces over there dont you get upset
4140354 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
4140355 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
4140356 weve known for more than 10 years which gene is at fault but we havent known some of the specifics of the process
4140357 now that we know that the fly gene works pretty much the way that the human one does we can look for the key substrate in flies and eventually test likely candidates in mice and see if theyre really associated with the disease
4140358 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4140359 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4140360 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4140361 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4140362 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4140363 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4140364 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4140365 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4140366 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4140367 we do call on russia to respect the territorial integrity of georgia
4140368 i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4140369 in my judgment this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality and i think it is something that all democratic countries should speak out strongly against and i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4140370 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
4140371 and i was supposed to be in love with you
4140372 and i wouldnt say shes toughened up but instead the problems hitting her now have become bigger at first it was learning to use a typewriter and now its a baby with the father of the baby someone she works with
4140373 some people just arent as likable as others no matter what they do pete campbell does the same stuff as don draper but drapers way more likable and gets away with things
4140374 jon is the lead and he always has something going on
4140375 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4140376 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4140377 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4140378 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4140379 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4140380 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4140381 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
4140382 this is like david versus goliath and victoria is not david
4140383 the newshour decided not to report the edwards revelation on its friday program
4140384 it was decided not to report the story in our news summary on the grounds that edwards is not a candidate for public office and not on any short list for vice president or any other public office so it struck us as a problem for him and his family not the american public

4140387 in central indiana alone logistics employment is projected to grow 20 percent over the next five years we believe that kelley graduates will be leading this trend and help solidify indianas position as a global supply chain hub
4140388 because of our geography and infrastructure central indianas logistics sector is growing and creating a demand for talent that we can help meet
4140389 we need major improvement in the math and science mastery of hoosier kids and we need it now the way to get started is a new wave of math teachers who really know their math and science teachers who really know their science trained intensively for a year in the classrooms of experienced educators
4140390 i applaud the governors action today in taking a step that has not been taken in any more other state he has offered a comprehensive remedy to some of the greatest challenges in teacher education
4140391 just as fellows will be selected based on their excellence the four schools impressed us with their commitment to find better ways of preparing teachers

4140430 we conduct the tests to validate what weve seen during the interview process
4140431 schtick is doing song parodies think weird al but better
4140432 it is useless to attempt to reason a man out of what he was never reasoned into
4140433 on the face of it the french can count their intervention in the georgian crisis as a big diplomatic success
4140434 its going to make it more difficult for the eu to have a russia policy the war if anything has divided the european unions member states
4140435 this has ended medvedevs honeymoon with the west its clear that putin not medvedev is in charge we had hoped for a new start now we have a new start but of a different kind
4140436 it is clear that the russian military action is bound to have consequences for eu russia relations
4140437 the implications on russia are almost invisible it wont make russia any less attractive
4140438 i suspect that the divisions in nato will have deepened in fact each side will probably feel justified in taking the position in bucharest that it did
4140439 we cannot afford to take a wait and see attitude toward the market
4140440 we must proactively evaluate every aspect of our organization to ensure that we are prepared to provide a large volume of new plants throughout the world
4140441 were pleased to be working again this season with the air force academy for a tremendous cause
4140442 this game was a huge success last year and were expecting another great turnout from our fans in the area
4140443 we had bad vision if there is no sun it is very difficult to tell the color of targets really not easy
4140444 i knew how to set the hit and i did it
4140445 i often heard him say that before he got his job if youd told him hed live west of the mississippi he never would have believed it
4140446 he came here because of the vicissitudes of the academic job market
4140447 he had a real passion for music especially those works that reflected aspects of the enlightenment and the french revolution
4140448 two of his favorite works were mozarts opera don giovanni and berliozs symphonie fantastique outside the school of music he was one of the most ardent music enthusiasts around
4140449 grew up with a love of learning a love of conversation a love of books
4140450 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
4140451 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them
4140452 our devotion to watching listening and staying in touch wherever and whenever we want shows no sign of diminishing and with healthy competition overall prices offer increasing value for money that is what consumers demand
4140453 but im not going to divorce you and im not going to let you die
4140454 like the civil rights activists whove given barack obama a chance to run for president they didnt take no for an answer we shouldnt take no for an answer when we push to create jobs and give every family in illinois a chance to be able to have a job and live the american dream
4140455 available for immediate occupancy hasnt been used in six years
4140456 speaking for the members of the house were not prepared to have things dictated to us and everybody in the building ought to understand that
4140457 i really dont want to participate in some sort of campaign demonizing democrats
4140458 its lost its traditional role of being an event where democrats come together and unify and speak of our common values and goals now it has become the governors latest tactical maneuver
4140459 theyre lucky to have a job and they have health care
4140460 theyre going to keep their jobs and keep their health care now start helping us create jobs for other people and provide health care to other people
4140461 is a negotiating ploy theres no question they will keep their health care
4140462 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4140463 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4140464 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4140465 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4140466 no one saw the fall but when they got to her she was on the ground and she died almost immediately of head and neck injuries
4140467 it had lots of problems including holes in the walls
4140468 but she just said this will work because it had 39 acres for her horses and she did a lot of work on that house its really quite nice now
4140469 my father took us horseback riding at our local stable
4140470 from the time i can remember she loved horses we grew up in a time of the western movies and tv shows so horses really captured our imagination
4140471 she told a friend she had the courage to kill it because she didnt want one of the campers to get bitten she did it to protect them
4140472 the same courage that she showed when she killed the copperhead allowed her to think she could take care of her big ranch all by herself
4140473 i remember one time she came home from school with her usual straight as except for one a minus
4140474 her mother said whats with the a minus her mother always expected excellence from her and she always delivered
4140475 she was working with cases of children whod been abused and abandoned
4140476 i think the day to day scenes of such difficult situations and feeling powerless to do anything about it was what drove her to another career with accounting youve got black and white situations and clear cut answers
4140477 there were eight horses there when she died including one blind very lame racehorse who can barely walk
4140478 plus two dogs and two cats she just loved animals the dogs she took in had behavior problems but shed work with them and bring them along with her loving care she took them in because they needed her help
4140479 would it be ok if i pumped gas for you this morning
4140480 have you heard about our special if you pay with cash gas is 8 cents cheaper so youll only pay 3 63 per gallon
4140481 thats cool i was planning to pay with cash anyway
4140482 that was pretty high they didnt know my knee hurt
4140483 you get excited when you can win like that thats just a thrill theyre all at home plate
4140484 if this doesnt help our confidence i dont know what will
4140485 ive got to hand it to our bullpen they came in and did a tremendous job
4140486 hes an asset to any lineup hes definitely an asset to ours
4140487 i said when we got him we cant leave it all on his shoulders
4140488 i pitched myself into that and i didnt pitch my way out of it
4140489 they shut our offense down and they kept coming at us and we couldnt hold them
4140490 theyve got some good hitters man jeff kent ive seen him for a long time hes a good hitter
4140491 if it was me thered have been a big ass rhino ecko logo on there if it was me i would have made sure people knew
4140492 we need to get t j back and healthy and keep working with the other guys but this question of the third receiver when most people dont have two i appreciate that
4140493 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4140494 two judges have already found hes violated conditions of his bond
4140495 i love being there so hopefully it will work out
4140496 but i dont know why they did it i think the nugget organization has a plan im 100 percent behind them
4140497 no not at all i wish i was out there standing around chitchatting with him a little bit
4140498 it wasnt a chance to start either way but sometimes guys in my position as a free agent look at it like you have to make a team
4140499 that was the choice i was trying to make is what team can i make i felt dallas gave me the best opportunity
4140500 i mean some of the linemen were huffin and puffin but i was fine
4140501 the main thing was to see our guys on both sides of the ball go against another group without being able to read their tendencies
4140502 actually i give mike shanahan his due because he called and initiated it last year
4140503 this is good because what his offense and defense do is different than what we do
4140504 i think part of it is encouraging your own players and not berating the other team
4140505 if you go out there and say good job you kicked his rear thats not conducive to a good practice
4140506 its a great opportunity to share a slice of life in small town america in the midst of an engaging democratic process
4140507 im sure well learn a lot in the process and so will arabs about us
4140508 the u s government does not like al jazeera because theres a sense they feed into anti u s sentiment
4140509 its mission is to represent the arab streets to the rest of the world and present the rest of the world to the arab streets
4140510 its a color piece to show arab viewers what americans are like
4140511 the idea is reach out to real world people and not just politicians and activists
4140512 a good place to have small town real world discussions
4140513 lets go find that one slide up in bernal and go sliding
4140514 wow cant believe theres a place like this in the city
4140515 oh yea im parched let me sip on this scalding dehydrating milky bevvie that will quench my thist in a jiffy
4140516 we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender
4140517 keep that faith keep your courage stick together stay strong do not yield do not flinch stand up were americans and well never surrender
4140518 i probably should have mentioned what you all already know these are tough times
4140519 i was more nervous than i have been for a long time coming into this race
4140520 im disappointed with my swim and would love to have made the semi finals and final although in my heart i knew that i wouldnt medal
4140521 i felt awful in the warm up then i did a few sprints and felt amazing but i felt awful again in the race and despite the preparation there was nothing i could do about it
4140522 im not saying ill go for another year another four years i just keep myself in shape enjoy it swimming isnt the be all and end all it always used to be ive enjoyed it a lot more because i didnt put pressure on myself
4140523 id lost to him eight nine 10 50 times i dont know how many but i had the feeling it could be my day today
4140524 he didnt play a good first game and that put me up straight away i played loose and free and i always fancy my chances on the 5 4 game
4140525 when he got that net cord i started wondering if it would turn around and he would come back playing like the best player in the world but i know i can beat the best in the world on my day and today i proved it
4140526 unless there is a major investment of funds for sport we have no alternative but to go the way of specialising in sports and events
4140527 im not out there im not part of whats going on
4140528 you never want to leave a player of todds experience and production behind
4140529 there is an intangible there that is special with him
4140530 but im a football guy ive always considered myself a football guy always will consider myself a football guy
4140531 football is where my heart is i ran track but i never practiced i just happen to be one of those lucky guys blessed with some speed
4140532 its a great problem to have but obviously at the end when you have to cut your roster down its not as fun
4140533 obviously in the end its tough to make the call
4140534 it doesnt feel crowded in there i enjoy learning things maybe they learned other places guys like darrell keary and brandon stokley theyve all picked up things in other offenses that i can put in my bag of tricks
4140535 chiefs coach herm edwards was getting his own guys in there but i just didnt feel like that was the place for me any more
4140536 running the ball is fine and ill block go over the middle ill do whatever it takes to win but i was also looking for the opportunity to have a chance to compete for more in the passing game
4140537 it was my first year in it too when i got here so it was steep for me as well and hes been in a totally different offense for four years not like some of the other guys we brought in here who have some experience with it like darrell jackson
4140538 but samie continues to learn and as he continues to get better the opportunities will present themselves for him more and more you see the leap that guys made between january and july and what samie has in the three preseason games left is an opportunity to make another leap
4140539 were installing things right now as far as myself im new to the system working with the new terminology slowly working it all in
4140540 i would think basically they brought me in to stretch the field a little bit to be somebody to help complement marshall they havent had that type of threat for a while the last few years since they had ashley lelie here he made a lot of plays down the field i want to do that too

4140612 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4140613 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4140614 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4140615 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4140616 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4140617 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4140618 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4140619 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4140620 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4140621 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4140622 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4140623 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4140624 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4140625 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4140666 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
4140667 where were they the organisations when i and my son were trying to get someone to look after this child do they even know what we have had to go through to save the life of david

4140670 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4140671 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4140672 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4140673 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4140674 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4140675 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4140676 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4140677 its like driving by a house and you see the fa ade of the house but in reality you could actually go inside and start opening some of the drawers and closets and see things
4140678 its a whole other level of experience another world there and so what im trying to do is sort of open some of the doors up there
4140679 i guess what im most interested in with photography is this question of bringing seemingly disparate elements into an image because theres so much of that in life and i think were all sort of taught to compartmentalize things
4140680 i like to think of new jersey as not just a place like princeton which is so privileged and pretty for the most part but i want to get out of these kind of socioeconomic geographic boxes and experience the diversity of things
4140681 then also put that into the photography if i can that juxtaposition of things that normally we kind of segregate one from the other
4140682 ive spent so much time doing other stuff to make money because i wasnt confident i could make money doing just writing or photography i always got into these other things basically corporate communications and some teaching but mostly on the corporate level
4140683 and theyre not disconnected from what i like but theyre not the real thing
4140684 its that kind of juxtaposition in this case of poverty and wealth or quote beauty and non beauty
4140685 to me digital is great for a lot of the obvious reasons you get to see the results right away you can do so much with the image when you get it to your computer and also you dont have a darkroom
4140686 which isnt to say that editing a photograph digitally is necessarily easy but you dont have chemicals and you dont have that whole labor intensive process of the darkroom
4140687 in fact if you look hard enough i think you can always find things worth photographing
4140688 i think if you never went more than 100 feet from your house you could probably make some wonderful photographs within 100 feet of wherever you are for a year
4140689 if you look and are imaginative enough then you hit it right
4140690 diet and exercise can control the weight that wrong eating and unhealthy habits can cause but they cannot combat the weight that is added through stress
4140691 in recent years the number of people who are overweight has increased dramatically worldwide two thirds of american men are overweight or obese but this is one case where following the crowd is not the best idea because extra weight especially belly fat can be downright risky
4140692 i love relacore i started taking it about 2 weeks ago i really just started taking it for the heck of it i would recommend this supplement to everyone that usually eats for emotional reasons i e boredom stress depression etc

4140705 this is bad news because we need european growth to prevent a global economic slowing but the economies in two major european economies are clearly slowing germanys gdp fell 0 5 in the first quarter and frances fell 0 3 in the second quarter so given their make up in the euro zone europe has experienced a pronounced slowing
4140706 on trade the strong euro has hurt exports but the majority of the decline is due to the slow u s economy
4140707 also european consumers like american consumers are feeling the pinch of reduced disposable income due to high energy and food prices
4140708 the oil induced slowdown has hit europe i would be really surprised if europe gdp stayed above 2 0 for 2008
4140709 it looks like retail purchasing power has declined too much for that to occur

4140763 eles deixaram seu cd na recep o do hotel onde eu estava hospedado e quando o ouvi no carro disse na hora essa a m sica do filme
4140764 s vezes era como estar fazendo teatro com centenas de pessoas em torno da gente nas cenas externas os jornais avisavam onde amos filmar e um monte de gente aparecia

4140770 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4140771 we would hope that he would be true to his word
4140772 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4140773 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them

4140775 this past year more families have been able to enjoy the company of their dog as they take day trips or longer vacations
4140776 our experience is that with a little pre trip planning and with the benefits of cerenia motion sickness no longer needs to be a reason to leave the family dog behind
4140777 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4140778 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4140779 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4140780 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4140781 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4140782 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4140783 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4140784 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4140785 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4140786 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4140787 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4140788 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4140789 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4140790 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4140791 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4140792 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4140793 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4140794 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4140795 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4140796 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4140797 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4140798 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4140799 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4140800 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4140801 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4140802 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4140803 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4140804 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4140805 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4140807 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4140808 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4140809 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4140810 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4140811 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4140812 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4140813 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago

4140816 the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially
4140817 i see a bunch of flames from the construction site its all plywood at that point and the whole thing you know within minutes of me standing there and watching it just went completely up in flames
4140818 it looked like probably the largest fire ive ever seen in my life
4140819 i would tell you that this is more than a shocking afternoon for me
4140820 i like looked out my window and i saw the whole thing was engulfed in flames and basically i just grabbed my dog and i ran down the stairs i didnt think at all i mean with the amount of fire trucks that were here i thought everything was going to be ok i did not think that my building was going to catch on fire thats why i brought nothing nothing not even a wallet
4140821 sheer horror that i have nothing but whats on my back ive never experienced anything like this before
4140822 we lost everything i mean our bed our couch everything that we had together i mean weve only been there for three months but everything is gone
4140823 i took my car and got it away from the building went across the railroad tracks to the other side and watched my building eventually get burned up
4140824 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4140825 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4140826 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4140827 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4140828 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4140829 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kind of hokey but its the truth
4140830 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4140831 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4140832 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4140833 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4140834 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4140835 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4140836 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4140837 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4140838 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4140839 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4140840 well it looks like i am going to have to tell you it is hold on is that one last little hand i see still up over there in the corner and what is your name then
4140841 ok albert and what do you think it might be then
4140842 go on albert tell us how bees could possibly bring down the human race
4140843 if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would have only four years of life left no more bees no more pollination no more plants no more animals no more life
4140844 quiet the rest of you can all stop laughing because albert is absolutely right well done boy keep this up and you could make a bit of a name for yourself in biology whats that you say albert physics no stick to what you are good at that is my advice
4140845 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4140846 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4140847 the danger here is that us backed georgian president mikheil saakashvili may again overestimate the strength of his perilous position and exacerbate the conflict with us personnel in the theater that could make a bad situation a lot worse for everyone
4140848 a sweet marsala wine sauce had him dragging bread through the plate after he was done
4140849 were just trying to see the situation on the ground
4140850 we need to take some bold transformative steps we need to find some potential areas to invest and see some long term dividends
4140851 we need almost a new deal type investment in alternative resources
4140852 honey ive been here for 85 years i would never leave
4140853 i see where the hope and potential is you have a system in place here
4140854 the problems that used to be associated with places like detroit or toledo are now felt across the board
4140855 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4140856 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4140857 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4140858 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4140859 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4140860 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4140861 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4140862 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4140863 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4140864 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4140865 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4140866 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4140867 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4140868 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4140869 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4140870 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4140871 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4140872 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4140873 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4140874 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4140875 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4140876 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4140877 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4140878 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4140879 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4140880 the board of supervisors shall hold a public hearing on the conditional use application
4140881 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4140882 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4140883 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4140884 we all have a right to our own opinion including todd
4140885 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4140886 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4140887 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4140888 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4140889 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4140890 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4140891 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4140892 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4140893 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4140894 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4140895 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4140896 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4140897 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4140898 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4140899 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4140900 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4140901 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

4140911 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4140912 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4140913 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4140914 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4140915 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4140916 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4140917 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4140918 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4140919 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4140920 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4140921 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4140922 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4140923 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4140924 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4140925 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4140926 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4140927 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4140928 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4140929 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4140930 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4140931 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4140932 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4140933 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4140934 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4140935 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4140936 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4140937 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4140938 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4140939 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4140940 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4140941 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4140942 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4140943 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4140944 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4140945 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4140946 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4140947 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4140948 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4140949 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4140950 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4140951 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4140952 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4140953 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4140954 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4140955 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4140956 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4140957 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4140958 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4140959 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4140960 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4140961 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4140962 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4140963 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4140964 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4140965 who will be the next president of the united states
4140966 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4140967 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4140968 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4140969 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4140970 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
4140971 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
4140972 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
4140973 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
4140974 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
4140975 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
4140976 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
4140977 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
4140978 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
4140979 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
4140980 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4140981 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
4140982 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
4140983 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
4140984 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
4140985 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
4140986 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
4140987 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
4140988 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
4140989 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4140990 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4140991 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4140992 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4140993 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4140994 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4140995 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4140996 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4140997 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4140998 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4140999 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4141000 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4141001 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4141002 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4141003 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4141004 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4141005 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4141006 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4141007 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4141008 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
4141009 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4141010 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4141011 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4141012 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4141013 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4141014 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4141015 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4141016 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4141017 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4141018 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4141019 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4141020 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4141021 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4141022 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4141023 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4141024 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4141025 i have been repeatedly charged with being an advocate of a theocratic state this is a flagrant misrepresentation the day to day activity of governing in no sense belongs in the sphere of religion what i do believe is that the state should not persecute religion and that religion should make an appropriate contribution to the spiritual life of the nation
4141026 the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment it could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him with man seen as the center of everything that exists
4141027 there is a disaster which has been under way for quite some time i am referring to the calamity of a despiritualized and irreligious human consciousness is man above everything is there no superior spirit above him
4141028 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4141029 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4141030 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4141031 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4141032 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4141033 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4141034 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4141035 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4141036 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4141037 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4141038 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4141039 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4141040 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4141041 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4141042 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4141043 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4141044 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4141045 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4141046 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4141047 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4141048 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4141049 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4141050 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4141051 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4141052 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4141053 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4141054 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4141055 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4141056 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4141057 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4141058 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4141059 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4141060 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4141061 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4141062 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4141063 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4141064 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4141065 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4141066 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4141067 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4141068 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4141069 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4141070 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula

4141072 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4141073 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4141074 i believe that america did the right thing by not joining the kyoto treaty

4141079 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4141080 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4141081 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4141082 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4141083 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4141084 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4141085 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4141086 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4141087 control non stop ayuda me quiero hacer la circuncisi n y no se como decirle a mis padres las filipinas
4141088 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4141089 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4141090 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4141091 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4141092 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4141093 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4141094 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4141095 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4141096 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4141097 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4141098 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4141099 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4141100 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4141101 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4141102 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4141103 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4141104 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4141105 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4141106 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4141107 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4141108 just so you all know we did set a record
4141109 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4141110 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4141111 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

4141115 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
4141116 this race can be very hot as we saw last year and our data from the thrilling final race of last season showed us that this change would be beneficial for the teams
4141117 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
4141118 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
4141119 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
4141120 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this fall is going to happen after this week

4141147 while biofuels will be responsible for a significant share of added demand for commodities in the coming years food will remain by far the primary consumer
4141148 looking ahead particularly at energy crops the overall supply and demand situation for the future remains delicately balanced with a number of the worlds major grain oilseed and sugar markets heavily reliant on more normal seasonal conditions in the coming years to ensure adequate production response to meet strong demand growth
4141149 people are talking about higher fuel prices but that leads to higher chemical and fertilizer costs too
4141150 on the other hand interest rates are lower reducing operating loan and long term investment costs
4141151 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4141152 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4141153 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4141154 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4141155 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4141156 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4141157 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4141158 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4141159 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4141160 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4141161 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4141162 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4141163 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4141164 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4141165 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4141166 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4141167 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4141168 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4141169 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4141170 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4141171 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4141172 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4141173 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4141174 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4141175 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4141176 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4141177 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4141178 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4141179 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4141180 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4141181 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4141182 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4141183 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4141184 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4141185 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4141186 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4141187 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4141188 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4141189 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4141190 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4141191 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4141192 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4141193 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4141194 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4141195 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4141196 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4141197 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4141198 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4141199 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4141200 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4141201 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4141202 local government will be a poorer place now that sandy has passed away national and local politicians from across the political spectrum will miss sandys zest for life his courage and his determination to fight for what he believed was right for people
4141203 his strong social conscience wonderful sense of humour and a passionate commitment to public service offered a template for all politicians from whichever party to aspire to
4141204 sandys dedication to help councils make peoples lives better and his inspiring passion led us and the sector to reach ever greater heights
4141205 in his year with english heritage sandy made a great contribution to our work
4141206 sandy bruce lockhart will be enormously missed both locally in kent and more broadly in the country
4141207 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4141208 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4141209 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4141210 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4141211 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4141212 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4141213 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4141214 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4141215 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4141216 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4141217 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4141218 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4141219 settled in im not sure i could be more settled in
4141220 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
4141221 and i was supposed to be in love with you
4141222 and i wouldnt say shes toughened up but instead the problems hitting her now have become bigger at first it was learning to use a typewriter and now its a baby with the father of the baby someone she works with
4141223 some people just arent as likable as others no matter what they do pete campbell does the same stuff as don draper but drapers way more likable and gets away with things
4141224 jon is the lead and he always has something going on
4141225 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4141226 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4141227 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4141228 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4141229 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4141230 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4141231 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
4141232 postmodernism is a change or be changed world the word is out reinvent yourself for the 21st century or die some would rather die than change
4141233 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4141234 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4141235 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4141236 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4141237 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4141238 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4141239 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4141240 who are open to doing something on the production side
4141241 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4141242 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4141243 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4141244 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4141245 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4141246 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4141247 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4141248 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4141249 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4141250 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4141251 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4141252 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4141253 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4141254 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4141255 i dont think it tells us very much more than wealthier people and higher social classes live in the south west and the south east though that doesnt detract from the achievements of students in these areas
4141256 there are also many more independent and selective schools in the southern part of the country and any additional improvement in selective schools is bound to be reflected in regional statistics
4141257 the exam boards themselves say this crude data on a level performance in the regions would need more analysis before you can draw any significant conclusions
4141258 across the country many more young people are getting valued a level qualifications especially in the priority subjects of english and maths
4141259 we do know that the improvement rate for overall a level passes is the same or faster in the north west than in all of the southern regions
4141260 we also know that exam results in london are now higher than the national average following years of underperformance
4141261 i heartily congratulate all students who have successfully completed their a levels and thank teachers for their hard work
4141262 more pupils are now passing maths a level than at any time in over a decade its crucial for society that we have talented mathematicians and maths is essential for science and innovation
4141263 todays results for science and maths a levels give us reason to be encouraged
4141264 maths and further maths have continued their robust recovery with the numbers of students taking these a levels increasing for the fifth year in a row this is a welcome pay off for the serious efforts made in recent years to boost this subject

4141267 the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially
4141268 i see a bunch of flames from the construction site its all plywood at that point and the whole thing you know within minutes of me standing there and watching it just went completely up in flames
4141269 it looked like probably the largest fire ive ever seen in my life
4141270 i would tell you that this is more than a shocking afternoon for me
4141271 i like looked out my window and i saw the whole thing was engulfed in flames and basically i just grabbed my dog and i ran down the stairs i didnt think at all i mean with the amount of fire trucks that were here i thought everything was going to be ok i did not think that my building was going to catch on fire thats why i brought nothing nothing not even a wallet
4141272 sheer horror that i have nothing but whats on my back ive never experienced anything like this before
4141273 we lost everything i mean our bed our couch everything that we had together i mean weve only been there for three months but everything is gone
4141274 i took my car and got it away from the building went across the railroad tracks to the other side and watched my building eventually get burned up
4141275 rosie actually saw the smoke out the window and sort of started tapping on it so i looked out and saw flames sort of higher than the buildings and ran down stairs with her grab my purse

4141294 ik zal gebruikers nog eens vragen wat zij wenselijk vinden maar mijn kaart zou zich echt moeten beperken tot echte probleemgebieden met geen ontvangst
4141295 wij hebben een redelijk goede dekking maar elke klacht wordt serieus bekeken
4141296 soms gaan er maanden overheen voordat een ontvangstprobleem wordt opgelost
4141297 maar over het algemeen vertoont ons netwerk maar weinig gaten
4141298 dit heeft zin als het om structurele meldingen gaat je hebt kans dat elk incident wordt gemeld

4141305 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4141306 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
4141307 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
4141308 this was a despicable senseless and cowardly attack on people who were working to improve the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in afghanistan
4141309 i join the international community in condemning this brutal act
4141310 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
4141311 i never believed this would happen i still dont quite believe this has happened
4141312 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
4141313 shell cant hide the environmental impact of their oil sand projects
4141314 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
4141315 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
4141316 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
4141317 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
4141318 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
4141319 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power

4141368 mr saakashvili claims the south ossetians provoked the current fighting but he appears to have been the chief protagonist the scale of thursdays local time attack on south ossetia and the preparations that were needed to carry it out suggest that mr saakashvili waited for the start of the beijing olympics with the aim of quickly grabbing control of the dissident region and then hoping that the inevitable international calls for a ceasefire perhaps with the arrival of international peacekeepers would lock in his newly won control of the region
4141369 georgias attempt to seize control of the secessionist south ossetia region has been a gamble too far reckless in its timing and founded on a fundamental misjudgment the military adventure had all the hallmarks of rushed planning and a fingers crossed strategy launched in the hope and expectation that the russians would not react but that if they did the americans and georgias other nato friends would come to his aid in one form or another

4141372 the only way to truly be happy in life and be successful is to do what interest you
4141373 i just stayed focused on the end result when you have everyone doubting you and your abilities this is the fuel that motivates the engine to run harder and faster every successful person goes through what i call their trial period this is where you have to go through different trials and tribulations to not only show the world what your made of but to show yourself that you are made of something you are somebody and a serious force to be reckoned with a lot of people believed that all my ideas and goals wasnt going to work they thought that i was just dreaming when i told them that one day i will own my own multi million dollar company making my own moves and calling the shots i love to tell my story because this is my way of saying to everyone who once talked down about me look at me now and what i have accomplished you know in my early days before my company took off i was that person working minimum wage jobs such as fast food i washed dishes cleaned toilets and put up with a whole of crap coming from so called bosses that i really thought were monkeys thinking that they were better than me and how they treated me but i guess you can say that this is how it is when your working for someone else you might as well say that i really felt like the toilets i cleaned ha i feel like this is the main reason why more and more people are turning into entreprenuers i mean lets be honest getting up in the morning going to a job sucks big time you will never make independent income that way how does that feel knowing that someone else controls your income you know a lot of people ask me well how can i become rich the best answer i tend to give them is they first have to figure out what their good at what is their expertise also you should find a good mentor you know someone who can inspire you to keep pushing even harder for your dreams and aspirations my mom and dad were a portion of good mentors to me before my mom latonya knight passed away she always taught me to be humble she was a very strong women my mother was a go getter my mother was the type of woman who made things happen period i feel this is why i am the way i am today because of her and my dad my dad who is currently still living can vounch for how my mom was she was very thorough with everything she did but all in all i love both of them and couldnt ask for a better mother or father they are both a reflection of who i am today

4141625 the question remains as to just how much more dollar appreciation can be seen but so long as it is being driven by weakness elsewhere rather than an upturn in the us economy theres arguably a lot of lost ground that needs to be made up
4141626 hey whats your name wanna hop up here on the bed and watch my surgery with me
4141627 the other mentally challenged patients over at the other observation ward euphemistically titled cabinet
4141628 the restav k practice essentially throws away the lives of children and along with them haitis future

4141630 if a person thus chooses to love another of the same sex or opposite and that person loves back why shouldnt they be allowed to formalize their relationship is love so frightening

4141633 i want to slap her and rewind this to the beginning when she walked in to see if we could do a better take like happy best friends like that acting technique of working from the outside in do the physical and the emotions will follow not that i ever believed in that technique but maybe it could work this time

4141636 finding someone to journey with in marriage is the slenderest part of a life long relational journey marriage is more about work than about divine luck more about finding someone to love than about finding someone to meet your own laundry list of personal needs
4141637 dare to believe marriage is good that the one you are in is good
4141638 he appeared to be a spirit and was about 15 to 18 inches off the ground it seemed that i could see through him he wore red black and white shepherds clothes like the coat in the movie of moses and held a staff in his hand he had long wavy dark brown hair down to his shoulders or longer he also had a beard and he stood about 6 feet tall even though he did not touch the ground what was so striking about him was his blue green eyes in his olive skin they were pools of liquid love and compassion
4141639 sent to minister to all believers not to be worshipped
4141640 it was not until i got to the dance that i learned that harrys roommate was a man that had tried to date me years before and he was acting as the bartender
4141641 when we arrived at the dance i noticed that this man who had tried to date me when i first came to town was acting as the bartender and learned that he was harrys roommate
4141642 what did i do this summer well i had lots of fun i hacked three computers nuking each one i dont know how many times i caused enough damage to force 72 reinstalls of the operating system
4141643 any reporter who hopes to do a good job should be able to talk to an interviewee quickly making them feel comfortable and willing to talk
4141644 journalists describe society to itself they convey information ideas and opinions they search discolse record question entertain comment and remember they inform citizens and animate democracy they give a practical form to freedom of expression they scriutinise power but also exercise it and should be responsible and accountable
4141645 what would you like to be when you grow up
4141646 this is the type of journalism i would love to do
4141647 in some press cultures reporters tend to be overly solicitous of officials and elderly people unfamiliar with the modern techniques of interviewing or simply fearful of the consequences of asking probing questions
4141648 on every issue important to firefighters senator obama is and has been in our corner
4141649 i bought another dinner for one i sit and watch some pointless rerun
4141650 sal porque volv a sentir dolores y por precauci n prefiero no viajar
4141651 the details erode public confidence that taxpayer money is being spent wisely
4141652 i think the symbolism is very important when it comes to issues like this
4141653 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4141654 yeah theres a lot of time and financial resources invested in improving water quality condition and particularly in terms of investing in that river frontage or riparian strip
4141655 and we need to be confident that the recommended practises that are being proposed are both socially acceptable and soundly based
4141656 theres not much point scientists proposing recommended practises if farmers dont find them acceptable and its also important to see what land holders understand about the links between these practices and the water quality outcomes
4141657 they might have different understandings of things than the scientists
4141658 the vast majority of ceops work is by resolution of ip addresses e mail addresses and increasingly mobile phone numbers
4141659 our troops are outside the towns of gori and senaki they did not enter those towns
4141660 they moved to those areas only because georgians troops took positions there to fire on south ossetia
4141661 why not lift the curtain on what is being delivered by u s airplanes to georgia
4141662 although georgian president mikheil saakashvili asked the international community for humanitarian aid quite understandably what is going on there we russians are deeply concerned about it
4141663 the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4141664 this is a small neighbor of russia it is a country that has made considerable progress in terms of its economy it is still trying to secure its democratic institutions and weve worked with georgia on that but if anyone had any doubts about our support for georgia you only have to look at the fact that its a millennium challenge country which is one of the most important designations that the united states can make that we believe in the future of that country
4141665 we will support any decision that the people of south ossetia and abkhazia will make in accordance with the un charter the 1966 international conventions and the helsinki act on security and cooperation in europe
4141666 we will not only support these decisions but will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world
4141667 as for our independence as for our movement toward this goal no other force will stop us we have set this goal and we will move toward this goal together as for the ways to achieve this goal we will find them
4141668 this is a nightmare some kind of a bad dream from which one has to wake up
4141669 there is immense aggression directed against absolutely innocent people we are living under occupation
4141670 i am from sukhumi first russia kicked me out from my home there in the early 1990s now they are also expelling us from our land georgia has been through the same thing twice and no one knows for what
4141671 i brought food some milk cheese and eggs ill leave it all here so that its distributed among the displaced
4141672 the president has asked us to help these people as well as the prime minister im a georgian man i have a little farm why else do i need any of it if i dont help my fellow georgians

4141676 reafirma os princ pios e bandeiras que lhe deram origem
4141677 os princ pios da cut se todos lembrarmos est o at hoje ainda gravados em seu estatuto que fazemos quest o de relembrar nestes 25 anos de cut
4141678 pelo contr rio o que esta escrito a necessidade da organiza o da classe trabalhadora de forma aut noma e independente da burguesia e de seu estado para lutar pelo socialismo e ao inv s de firme
4141679 como se isso fosse resolver os problemas pelos quais passa a classe trabalhadora
4141680 durante v rios anos defendemos o fim do imposto sindical sozinhos a partir do f rum nacional do trabalho com o objetivo de prepararmos uma reforma sindical que acabou engavetada no congresso nacional avan amos muito no convencimento dos outros setores da estrutura sindical ap s o reconhecimento legal das centrais iniciamos outra batalha pol tica em que a cut conseguiu obter acordo com as demais sobre a necessidade de acabar com o imposto esta uma conquista do papel mobilizador e articulador da cut
4141681 a partir de ent o a pr xima etapa ser o trabalho junto aos deputados e senadores especialmente sobre aqueles que chegaram a votar contra o reconhecimento das centrais e usaram a contrariedade com o imposto sindical como argumento para cobrar coer ncia e aprova o definitivamente de uma forma democr tica de financiamento da estrutura
4141682 a contribui o ser aprovada em assembl ia para entidades que efetivamente realizam a o sindical do contr rio ser muito dif cil convencer as bases
4141683 os c lculos que temos mostram que at 2050 n o preciso nova reforma previdenci ria a quest o gest o e crescimento econ mico
4141684 va a apoyar a quien hace trampas y practica f rmulas de dopaje
4141685 es una pena que se conozca a una aragonesa por algo as por eso no vamos a consentir que se le apoye
4141686 those who dont worry too much about prices and like to spend their money on travel or dinners rather than new cars are generally happier than those who spend a lot on expensive purchases and carry credit card debt
4141687 understanding the demographics and the different influences that play into gambling can help psychologists tailor their interventions for people who get into trouble
4141688 moderate income x gamblers big fish are at the most risk for losing the most money and suffering the most overwhelming financial and psychological consequences the whales can afford to lose money and the jumbo shrimps dont have much money to lose
4141689 this type of time frame helps people see steady progress along the way while not feeling too much pressure this is similar to some of the dieting regimens not too close so you dont see progress but not too far away either so you dont get discouraged
4141690 even though guilt and shame are often interchangeably used each is a distinct emotion
4141691 participants who felt guilty about the impulse buying used proactive coping strategies such as adjusting budgets and planning to reduce impulse buying in the future on the other hand shameful buyers used more avoidant emotion focused strategies such as denial and reframing the incident to be less injurious to the self
4141692 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4141693 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

4141695 the fact that this garment was shaped by monsieur own hand you can really feel the souffrance his creativity weighed on him
4141696 we think its crucial that we do experiments to check it out
4141697 in the absence of treatment with fty720 we have an exhausted immune response in the presence of treatment we regain a robust cellular immune response
4141698 the president was informed immediately on friday when we received news of the first two into georgian territory
4141699 the idea that working with the kernel community is hard to me is a myth or at least a misconception
4141700 it is only hard if you dont take the time to learn how the community works
4141701 whenever you step into a large organized operation there are going to be some ground rules and if you ignore those rules you will find working with the community very hard
4141702 my goal was driven by talking with folks that wished they had something they could hand out to companies and developers to see how to participate and get their code into the kernel
4141703 there is a lot of disagreement between the kernel development community and certain vendors who dont see the reasons or the need to incorporate their code
4141704 one reason is that code in the mainline kernel tends to be higher quality code
4141705 there are persistent concerns about quality control with some people feeling that were spending too much time merging new stuff into the kernel and perhaps not enough time fixing stuff that is already there
4141706 thats not a universally held opinion and its really hard to come up with objective metrics on whether the kernel is becoming more buggy or less so
4141707 vh1 hip hop honors has come to represent the pinnacle of innovation and achievement in hip hop music
4141708 this years five honorees are no different and are being recognized for their significant contributions to hip hop culture and for helping to elevate hip hop into a truly global phenomenon
4141709 that will make the 40 40 club in vegas the largest sports booking operation
4141710 people can gamble both at the tables and on games the sands will also have the right to open 40 40 clubs in london and across europe
4141711 this is what they want they know thats what they gettin they ask me what i do i tell em im teaching for a living
4141712 look out for my boys no homo cant tell em what youre told thats a no no
4141713 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
4141714 this was a rare and isolated incident to happen on the streets of staffordshire
4141715 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
4141716 all men make mistakes but only wise men learn from their mistakes
4141717 if we dont change the patterns were in for a long and slow and arduous collapse
4141718 the suburbs have three destinies none of them exclusive as materials salvage as slums and as ruins
4141719 to pay for the expanded services taxes will also increase exponentially to the point where individual pay checks are made payable to the government and deposited directly in the general treasury
4141720 if gentrification continues in a significant way large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central city dwellers stirring the ethnic pot in both places
4141721 the will and grace version of gay america urban wealthy and white is starting to look a bit dated
4141722 suburbia will be flexible it will be smarter and it will be hybrid
4141723 in 40 years perhaps we ll get beyond our fixation with the suburbs love them or hate them and develop a richer vocabulary for what lies beyond the city limits
4141724 it depends on how smart and bold we are willing to be
4141725 suburbs are an unsustainable monstrosity that will eventually run out of room to grow commuting to major cities by car will also go by the wayside it is time to start using space more smartly
4141726 one symptom of this is that the only subject under discussion about our energy predicament is how can we keep running all our cars by other means even the leading environmentalists talk of little else we don t get it the happy motoring era is over
4141727 their culture is energy efficient why cant we be like them
4141728 bearing in mind the technological progress of the last 40 years is it realistic to argue that over the next 40 years absolutely no new energy source or process will be used to keep personal transportation viable
4141729 i agree again with the school system comment i have two kids and even if gas goes to 10 gallon i won t move to the city i have a 30 mile commute and it s worth every minute knowing my kids are going to schools where the parents are engaged in the education process and the kids excel
4141730 by the way i subscribe to the solar wind nuclear energy fix to our crisis and think we don t have long to wait for abundant energy
4141731 some of us just like the quiet open spaces trees and stars you can actually see at night people are not going to give up pleasant communities en masse
4141732 i have small kids and i am coming to the realization that i will soon be locked into a suburb about 30 minutes from downtown that s the only place where the good schools are and unless you pay for private school you are required to go to the school nearest your home its very disappointing and i guarantee you it is the cause of suburbs i cannot in good conscience live any closer to town because the schools are crap as you get closer to town i think that if school choice were allowed the suburbs would start to creep back toward the city center
4141733 they see urban dwellers as narrow minded shallow and apt to follow every latest fad
4141734 if the land is taxed at a higher percentage the only one that suffers is the big landowner and land speculator sprawl would not occur to my knowledge where ever this has been tried it has never done harm
4141735 most suburbs particularly outside the us don t look as ugly as the picture at the top of this article
4141736 service amp retail jobs are located near the people i do not commute from a suburb to city to access my mechanic plumber dentist daycare provider medical clinic or retail store
4141737 i choose to live in the city and i like it for reason s obviously im an intelligent and desirable person to be around and thus my choice is not only the best choice but the right choice you pseudo intellectual breeders who have made a different choice are obviously wrong and need to be re educated
4141738 everyone thinks the world will somehow turn into a futureworld but in fact in twenty years things will look pretty much like they do now
4141739 wheres my flying car werent we supposed to have flying cars by now
4141740 the fundamental underlying injustices that lie at the root of the problems the city have are problems in large part caused by the very existence of suburbia
4141741 ill grant you that if you know going in that you will own a car for 5 to 10 years outright purchase even financed may be the way to go
4141742 however if you are unsure that you will want the car that long a 3 year lease often makes as much sense as living with your boyfriend girlfriend a few years before committing to marriage
4141743 i will always try to rent an asset that declines in value and gives me no tax benefit in exchange for my sacrifice rather than purchase it
4141744 this time i feel real lucky to be leasing i have a 2006 tahoe with 16 months left it is so under water now and when the lease is up it will be worth 12 000 less than the residual if i had purchased it i would be in big trouble
4141745 you may think it makes more sense to keep a car until it is paid off and driving it around for years makes good financial sense
4141746 to me it makes the most sense to never own a depreciating asset especially one that depreciates as fast as an automobile
4141747 depreciation is just an accounting term that we use to write off the useful life of the assets ability to produce earnings we cannot and should not use this in our personal finances our personal assets do not generate revenue and therefore cannot be depreciated
4141748 my husband has recently retired after over 40 years of hard work and would love to own a porsche always has wanted one never could afford it but we both think the price tag on cars like this is ridiculous and a waste of good money i hate for him not to be able to realize his lifelong dream or to enjoy himself tooling around in a porsche for a year or two and suggested he lease one then give it back after the two year period a mistake
4141749 god wants me to be the best that i can be with the tools he has given me
4141750 more than that i think that god wants me to share whatever i have little as it may be with others to watch out for my fellow man while i watch out for myself and that the reward may be more in my heart than in my wallet but for me thats better
4141751 i believe god doesnt want us to be poor or rich its our attitude about money that matters the world contains enough resources for each person to have what he she needs but in our quest for more some folks take more than they need which means others end up lacking as you said its tragic to drive a mercedes and not give someone a ride i believe god would say rather than giving them a ride sell the mercedes buy two hybrids and give one to the person without a car
4141752 i dont believe for a minute god wants us to be poor
4141753 would any father or mother want their children to have anything less than the best that doesnt mean everything will be handed to us
4141754 god wants me to be a steward of the resources of my life so that no one in my circle of influence is poor
4141755 when you are given the blessings of good health and a wealth of opportunity you need to recognize that these are gifts by the grace of god with experience these gifts can be leveraged to gain a joy of living and they need to be nurtured by the joy of giving
4141756 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4141757 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4141758 you see how they do out here in the country christmas lights on the junk car

4141775 the span of time that these canisters are going to be in this state is really finite
4141776 and the hospital is concerned that theyre now basically corroding

4141788 we want to win tournaments and have that adrenaline coursing through our bodies
4141789 we played like we wanted to win we played together
4141790 we were very aware of their offensive sets we were very aware of their personnel and we played like that so we were kind of a step in front of what they wanted to do because we kind of knew everything already
4141791 any time you get beat its embarrassing and thats enough
4141792 and we can really use that as a tool to help us with our defense now and thats the name of the game because if you play good defense no matter how youre shooting the ball youre going to be in the game
4141793 im think he still hasnt found a good chemistry with yao this isnt easy but today much better
4141794 he opposes the employee free choice act and thats a litmus test

4141819 on february 5 the defendant and his pregnant wife were late for an appointment at the royal oldham hospital
4141820 at reception scott morris was taking a call he told the defendant he wouldnt be a moment and to take a seat
4141821 mr morris then had to leave the reception momentarily but indicated he would be back quickly
4141822 mr morris warned the defendant that he would call security and asked if the words were being directed at him
4141823 at this point a health care assistant came to reception and the defendant swore when telling her the man had been on the phone and was ignoring him
4141824 she said the defendant had his finger constantly pressed on the bell
4141825 when she asked him to take a seat the defendant became very agitated he came so close their faces were touching

4141832 we have completed the initial data collection and now plan to allow the water in the shaft to return to natural equilibrium over the next couple of weeks we will continue gathering and assessing the information we require to determine the next steps in our remediation plan
4141833 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
4141834 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4141835 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
4141836 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
4141837 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possession of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
4141838 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense

4141840 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
4141841 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
4141842 we are now in a fight against the great russia
4141843 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
4141844 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
4141845 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

4141847 it is hard to see through the fog of this war another pipeline through georgia
4141848 multinationals and central asian and caspian governments may think twice about building new lines through this corridor it may even call into question the reliability of moving existing volumes through that corridor
4141849 russians treasured the fact they had a monopoly on oil and gas pipelines from central asia as it gave them considerable clout
4141850 by agreeing to having an oil pipeline georgia made itself more vulnerable
4141851 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4141852 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer

4141856 otherwise the membership to the greek cypriot football federation as they want and opening of the doors to the friendly matches as they propose cannot be acceptable

4141859 he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarahs womb
4141860 ironically one of the things that reduces your enthusiasm to really go the extra mile in making games is the thought that thousands of ungrateful gits will swipe the whole thing on day one for nothing
4141861 its very demoralising but actually talking to the pirates has revealed a huge group of people who really appreciate genuinely good games
4141862 some of the criticisms of my games hit home i get the impression that if i make kudos 2 not just lots better than the original but hugely overwhelmingly massively better well polished designed and balanced that a lot of would be pirates will actually buy it
4141863 ive gone from being demoralised by pirates to actually being inspired by them and im working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished
4141864 if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it

4141868 it is our hope and prayer that caylee is found alive and well
4141869 what we dont have is information on exactly where caylee was last the one person who has that information is casey anthony and she is not providing information thats accurate to us
4141870 you would think the people who have my granddaughter would be smart enough to say listen im going to turn the girl back in to her family

4141878 its hard to make generalisations it can depend heavily on species as some are more affected by recreation than others
4141879 these animals have high intelligence and those that are cautious survive
4141880 yeah preventing the egg from attaching to the uterine wall really is murder so guys you really dont have to do the job you agreed to do
4141881 for war you need three things 1 money 2 money 3 money

4141885 we go up there and have a bit of a look at what all these elders are raving about and we find out what the deal was with these deserters once and for all we see if youre right
4141886 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4141887 now what what do the elders do with it to get the memories out of it
4141888 it has little things like tiny ribbons in it do you think they drink it
4141889 no youre not it could be poisonous like the stuff that the elders said was in their special storerooms you cant do it theres another way
4141890 did you really think you could get away we could never let you escape the future is too precious for that now you will become just another missing child one in the millions it will take to build the future of the faithful
4141891 wal mart has bullied its workers and managers for years

4141898 i was around him a lot it was great we went to africa the whole experience was life altering for me
4141899 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4141900 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4141901 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4141902 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4141903 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4141904 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4141905 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4141906 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4141907 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4141908 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4141909 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4141910 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4141911 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4141912 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4141913 it is hard to see through the fog of this war another pipeline through georgia
4141914 multinationals and central asian and caspian governments may think twice about building new lines through this corridor it may even call into question the reliability of moving existing volumes through that corridor
4141915 russians treasured the fact they had a monopoly on oil and gas pipelines from central asia as it gave them considerable clout
4141916 by agreeing to having an oil pipeline georgia made itself more vulnerable
4141917 seeing apes in entertainment may lead people to believe that conservation is not an issue for them
4141918 if that diminishes concern for conservation then thats a problem
4141919 the fact that steve martins place which is one of the major players in the business is taken out of hollywood now thats a major coup
4141920 there actually is a shot to get all orangutans out of the entertainment industry
4141921 luckily we came along at a time when the martins were open to the notion of change and the great ape trust was a perfect solution
4141922 this was as close to win win as you can get
4141923 there are people in the entertainment industry that probably realize that cooperation is the way to go
4141924 this lack of awareness generally translates into a lack of concern and caring
4141925 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4141926 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
4141927 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4141928 european officials are increasingly concerned that sen barack obamas campaign pledge to begin direct talks with iran on its nuclear program without preconditions could potentially rupture u s relations with key european allies early in a potential obama administration
4141929 if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time
4141930 that is what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what nixon did with mao what reagan did with gorbachev
4141931 paul nitze the assistant secretary of defense said the meeting was just a disaster khrushchevs aide after the first day said the american president seemed very inexperienced even immature khrushchev agreed noting that the youthful kennedy was too intelligent and too weak the soviet leader left vienna elated and with a very low opinion of the leader of the free world
4141932 in january 2007 he introduced legislation in the senate to remove all of our combat troops from iraq by march 2008
4141933 obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within 16 months
4141934 would not prove to be one that changes the dynamics significantly
4141935 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
4141936 obviously its jerusalem going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of the negotiations
4141937 h e used a word to represent what he did not want to see again and then realized afterwards that that word is a code word in the middle east
4141938 i do believe obama is like john kennedy a great man with a great principle and he has a vision to change america to make it in a position to lead the world community but not with humiliation and arrogance
4141939 we all agree that john kennedy was a great president and its flattering when anybody says that barack obama would follow in his footsteps
4141940 i think we should use the hammer of a potential opt out as leverage
4141941 im a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people
4141942 i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother
4141943 his comments were not only divisive and destructive but i believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate and i believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church
4141944 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial
4141945 mr obama is hawking a tax policy that would take the nation back to the effective marginal tax rates of the carter days he wants to further tax income payroll capital gains dividends and death his philosophy is pure redistribution
4141946 taxes change behavior by raising rates on upper income payers obama is reducing their incentive to work and take risks the income tax increase is not all that he has in mind for them he plans to increase their payroll taxes the taxes they pay on dividends received and capital gains earned and on any transfers they might have in mind to their kith and kin when they shuffle off this mortal coil if the aggregate of these additional taxes substantially diminishes incentives to set up a small business of the sort that has created most of the new jobs in recent decades the 1 000 tax rebate will be more than offset by the consequences of reduced growth and new business formation
4141947 mr obama favors ethanol subsidies some of which end up in the hands of the same oil companies he says should be subjected to a windfall profits tax
4141948 sen barack obama was the most liberal senator in 2007
4141949 the ratings system devised in 1981 under the direction of william schneider a political analyst and commentator and a contributing editor to national journal also assigns composite scores an average of the members issue based scores in 2007 obamas composite liberal score of 95 5 was the highest in the senate rounding out the top five most liberal senators last year were sens sheldon whitehouse d r i with a composite liberal score of 94 3 joseph biden d del with a 94 2 bernie sanders i vt with a 93 7 and robert menendez d n j with a 92 8
4141950 today we achieved something amazing 2 000 000 donors owning a piece of this campaign
4141951 in the face of john mccains low road tactics its more important than ever to keep our movement growing and show the power of millions of grassroots supporters coming together to work for change
4141952 zusammen mit den sinkenden rohstoffpreisen d rfte dies wenn es anh lt zu einer deutlich niedrigeren inflation in den kommenden quartalen beitragen
4141953 insofern ist ein gro es augenmerk auf die august daten zu legen
4141954 die inflation wird damit auf absehbare zeit das sorgenkind bleiben
4141955 dieses pferd l sst einen gut aussehen wir sind superfroh dass wir es trotz aller unkenrufe geschafft haben
4141956 da hatte man ein bisschen mehr erwartet aber es waren zu viele kleinigkeiten
4141957 das was wir uns vorgenommen haben hat nicht ganz geklappt
4141958 bei mir h tte es besser laufen k nnen so zwei drei prozentpunkte mehr
4141959 salinero heute aufgeregt war es war nicht der lockerste ritt von uns beiden
4141960 the swedish military has for example assisted in introducing an environmental management system in georgia in this way the georgian military should be taking a more environmentally friendly approach from the command level down to the unit level
4141961 with sweet attention rookie of the year have mastered the pop album
4141962 as a compliment when what we really mean is that they stuffed four or five impressive songs right at the outset of the album and then proceeded to bring in the dumping lorry to fill out the remainder with c grade material
4141963 applied here it illustrates how no matter where the song initiates in terms of mood and pace it ends up at virtually the same style of chorus practically every time
4141964 for nailing perfectly the stripped back summer melodramatic mood that so many try and yet fail to capture all without resorting to the aforementioned identikit break out chorus as well touche
4141965 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4141966 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4141967 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4141968 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4141969 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4141970 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4141971 recibir la visita de autoridades de mi alma mater es como recibir la visita de la madre o de la familia
4141972 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4141973 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4141974 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4141975 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4141976 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4141977 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4141978 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4141979 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4141980 the money madrid are asking for is exaggerated in todays market
4141981 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4141982 young people do not understand the importance of taking control of your own retirement pot and there is a degree of complacency because pensions are long term and they think they can put it off until tomorrow or next year 7 2 aer fixed on your savings

4141986 it is particularly galling to find that they are prepared to take in vain the name of an organisation which works to protect consumers and businesses from scams and unfair practice
4141987 i do not think that word means what you think it means
4141988 i dont know if hes got balls or a vajayjay but i have no babies sucking on my titties so he better man up

4141997 y sin inmutarnos por las amenazas sin inmutarnos por las maniobras recordando que un d a nosotros fuimos 12 hombres solamente y que comparada aquella fuerza nuestra con la fuerza de la tiran a nuestra fuerza era tan peque a y tan insignificante que nadie habr a cre do posible resistir sin embargo nosotros cre amos que resist amos entonces como creemos hoy que resistimos a cualquier agresi n y no s lo que sabremos resistir cualquier agresi n sino que sabremos vencer cualquier agresi n y que nuevamente no tendr amos otra disyuntiva que aquella con que iniciamos la lucha revolucionaria la de la libertad o la muerte s lo que ahora libertad quiere decir algo m s todav a libertad quiere decir patria y la disyuntiva nuestra ser a patria o muerte

4142012 transfolks you and your issues are on the table but theres a limit were all quite comfortable including you in a hate crimes law after all thats easy to get done and it makes us look good thing is many of us are still not quite so sure we want to make the effort to actually fight for you and possibly expend valuable political capital on your behalf in order to protect you from discrimination in the workplace so were leaving ourselves a back door just in case we decide to chicken out again

4142018 president dmitri medvedev of russia on thursday said that russia would act as an international guarantor of south ossetia and abkhazia the two pro russian enclaves at the center of the crisis that have long desired separation from georgia as secretary of state condoleezza rice headed to the region for discussions on the crisis and to show support for georgian president mikheil saakashvili the russian position seemed to be a direct challenge to president bush who said a day earlier that he insists that the sovereign and territorial integrity of georgia be respected on wednesday the united states and georgia called the russian advances into gori and another strategic georgian city a violation of the cease fire agreement struck only hours earlier in response mr bush sent american troops to georgia to oversee a vigorous and ongoing humanitarian mission in a direct challenge to russias display of military dominance over the region mr bush demanded that russia abide by the cease fire and withdraw its forces or risk its place in the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century it was his strongest warning yet of potential retaliation against russia over the conflict

4142035 zu nennen ist beispielsweise die verl ngerung beziehungsweise einf hrung von spekulationsfristen bei immobilientransaktionen sowie die limitierung von neuen krediten
4142036 vor allem die exportindustrie k nnte aufgrund der hohen rohstoffpreise unter druck geraten

4142052 even when you do ask you dont get it because you want only what will give you pleasure
4142053 this is the confidence we have in him if we ask anything according to his will he hears
4142054 the lord is good to those who wait expectantly for him

4142060 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
4142061 air pollution is a very real threat to the health and well being of canadians of all ages
4142062 the data from the icap study is clear we need concrete and real action on air pollution and a national action plan on lung health if we are to stem the thousands of deaths that occur annually as a direct result of both short and long term exposure to pollutants
4142063 the icap study is a valuable tool to health organizations and public policy makers as we move forward on building a healthier environment for canadians
4142064 the icap study re enforces the very real need for a strategy that deals with both environmental impacts and their health outcomes

4142073 todd is a good friend but more importantly he is a friend of god ive met very few people in my life who are hungrier for god and will take extended periods of time just to seek him god has entrusted him with an extraordinary outpouring for a reason he can trust him to do whatever he says regardless of the opinions of others he is bold amazingly bold the miracles are legitimate and increasing the church of america has asked for a great revival god wonderfully placed this move in a package that few would have expected just to see if were as hungry as we say we are

4142075 i have been consistently disappointed in sunocos management they fail to understand that sustainability is not just a matter of stakeholder management as might be reflected in the companys dismal performance issues related to sustainability pose strategic threats and opportunities to sunoco that the board of directors in their role as fiduciaries are charged with considering
4142076 our aim is to find out what the dominant infant care practices in south asian and european families are so that we can identify which practices could have a protective effect against sids instances of sids are generally lower in families of south asian origin
4142077 we hope that dr moyas research will help us to design targeted baby care messages aimed at changing unsafe infant care practices and save babies lives
4142078 sids is still the biggest killer of babies over one month old in the uk today claiming more than 300 infants lives every year

4142117 for those enterprises that we can very distinctly separate crop production versus livestock production land ownership versus livestock production i want to separate those so that we know whats making us money
4142118 so if were going through a time period where land rents are going way up land values are going up just recognize that that might be whats making you money not necessarily running cattle
4142119 on the other hand that doesnt necessarily mean you get out of the cattle business just recognize it in the short run recognize where the profits are coming from and then try to manage around it accordingly

4142151 as a liquid fuel reactor the msr has two sets of unique characteristics relative to solid fuel reactors
4142152 changing from a steam cycle to a gas brayton cycle eliminates this class of challenges
4142153 being constructed in south africa with a helium brayton power cycle
4142154 in the last decade compact plate fin and printed circuit high temperature heat exchangers have been developed for the aircraft chemical and offshore oil industries the adoption of compact heat exchangers drastically reduces the molten fuel salt inventory in the heat exchangers and may reduce the inventory of fuel salt in the reactor by up to 50 there are major benefits in using such heat exchangers products used in industry these heat exchangers are being considered for use in high temperature helium cooled reactors and in the transport of heat from high temperature gas cooled reactors to hydrogen production plants using liquid fluoride salt heat transport systems additional work is required to fully evaluate their use in msr s
4142155 in an msr volatile fission products including xenon are removed continuously which creates a large parasitic neutron sink in solid fuel reactors
4142156 the size of the heat exchangers is reduced by a factor of 3 or more
4142157 the aircraft and other industries have developed compact heat exchangers with buffer gas zones to separate different fluids that may react explosively such as hot gases vaporizing fuels in aircraft
4142158 carbon carbon composites are potentially an enabling technology for very high temperature msrs however there are major technical uncertainties including joining technologies
4142159 pound for pound carbon nanotubes are stronger and lighter than steel
4142160 the shape and direction of this imperfection does not change and it never gets any larger
4142161 we were amazed by it but upon further study we found a good explanation the atomic irregularity acts as a kind of safety valve allowing the nanotube to release excess energy in much the way that a valve allows steam to escape from a kettle
4142162 i am the most discrete student among all the boys
4142163 angels do not come down from heaven for they do not know how to walk here with us

4142170 i have great faith and trust and belief in dustin grutza
4142171 like we always said one guy doesnt have to win the game its how does that 1 11th of the team make sure were in the right play with the leadership and with the other guys rallying around him and respecting him hes a guy that commands respect hes a loyal guy and he cares deeply he works his butt off out there some of those mistakes the coaches have to clean up some of those mistakes he has to clean up collectively i dont have any questions whatsoever
4142172 that competition lets face it brings out the best in guys
4142173 thats the great thing about having extra competition out there when you have more guys than you have starting positions youve got a handful of guys who all want to be that guy that brings the best out of people
4142174 im preparing as hard as i can we have big goals this year winning the big east championship were trying to get the guys and lead them i feel good in what i can do
4142175 the funding choices made were inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases or the money was going to fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
4142176 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
4142177 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
4142178 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding
4142179 weve been nominated for a juno award thats as mainstream as you get for popular music in canada
4142180 that argument falls flat in our case and from what ive read for a lot of other people as well
4142181 to describe the work of artists who sample the greater sludgepile of internet content
4142182 it is the generic packaging and selling of unique works of art i think industry mediocrity is more of a threat to the future of reading than television is

4142229 i stayed just to ask you to have a deep look within find whats wrong and not this
4142230 we can call off our relation if it disturbs you
4142231 your wifes intimately involved with that rock musician i have the photographs
4142232 give me those tomorrow morning collect your cheque and i think that will be enough for now
4142233 back home everyone will call you a whore and laugh at me

4142237 so your wife dumped you for another man six months ago dont you live
4142238 you kept us off from trespassing into your life when you were bringing up your factory
4142239 we were never a part of your emotional environment so dont waste your energies on me now

4142249 sermonizing is something people hate still there are times when our work our relations and our health everything troubles us we feel troubled however the innate nature of our spirit and our surroundings is to be joyous how do we achieve it
4142250 most human beings fail to achieve happiness by adopting different paths like idealism spiritualism capitalism materialism socialism or other isms after spending years chasing these goals people discover it has eluded the promise of happiness offered by them
4142251 have you seen a bird die of starvation have you seen it worrying it lives everyday joyously without worrying for the next if it had been like us it would start hoarding grains for the next day to survive and exist
4142252 so if a bird can survive despite being frail and peaceful then what are the people of this world doing going to work places in the morning and then returning from those work places in the evening
4142253 to elaborate imagine yourself to be the ball of a pendulum that swings
4142254 similarly when you gain a spiritual perspective you begin to grasp the higher truth and meaning of life by freeing yourself from anxieties worries wants needs and insecurities you step out of your aimless state most of the humanity is busy mistaking its business to be the essence of life we wrongly believe that that is our real job in life so what is the real essence of our pendulum like existence this we have to find out for ourselves but the more you think of this world the more you realize its an illusion incapable of giving true joy through achievements success or accumulation of wealth this life makes no sense to those who live with the sole object of fulfilling their material needs because they can never be fulfilled we have to find its deeper significance
4142255 dont be impatient im quite sure that religion has failed primarily because its dogmatic a practical approach especially in the imbibing stage can create a difference be patient its going to happen soon
4142256 oh just that you have a comparatively younger crowd i thought mostly old people join spirituality because they have nothing better to do
4142257 age and experience have no relevance in the path of spirituality when the eye of the mind opens we see what we fail to see normally but what exists in us forever
4142258 you are referring to the third eye they speak of in mythology
4142259 yet i dont know why i get this feeling there is a deep rooted sadness which your eyes betray
4142260 grief or unhappiness is what takes most people to spirituality
4142261 however some people are born seekers they are the lucky ones
4142262 if you wish to play from the heart then all the skills will return

4142265 in that case this guitar belongs to you accept a gift from a brother
4142266 ill buy another i think this one was made especially for you
4142267 dont try to suppress thoughts because they are much like a spring push them down and they recoil watch them and tell yourself that you are not your thoughts negate all thoughts by saying neti neti neti which means i am not this i am not this thought when thoughts leave us then what remains is thoughtless awareness in this domain resides the lord

4142271 today i am not going to give you any spiritual discourse instead i wish to discuss only the problems that are troubling you
4142272 why does god not solve all our problems if he is almighty and powerful
4142273 youll have to answer a few questions before i answer yours
4142274 before you came to this lecture hall did you hear about the fire
4142275 were you aware of some people trapped in the blaze
4142276 did you hear cries for help the shouts and the screams
4142277 were you told the fire engines would take an hour to arrive
4142278 you thought of your safety and not about the safety of others
4142279 still six people took pains and tried to help in whatever little capacity they could they did the best they could even though they were untrained in fighting fires what they had with them was the intent to help
4142280 tell me what you would have done if it had been your son or your wife trapped in that fire would you still have stayed in the safety of the ground and waited for the fire service to arrive
4142281 you have to answer me honestly you ask me many questions just answer this one would you have bothered then if you were a fire fighter or not
4142282 can you see your error all of you what you did was it right to secure your belongings while ignoring people who might be dying
4142283 not only on your part but of the entire collective
4142284 except six people none of you had any compassion for those trapped in the fire
4142285 we created smoke to see how you would respond we recorded all the voices that you heard this was just a test to see how you put to practice what you learnt here
4142286 what happened today in the afternoon is a sad reflection of the society as a whole everyone is living for themselves and the habit has become so universal that we neglect others routinely even when it is in our power to help reduce the suffering around us
4142287 how many of us waste our food and throw it into the garbage instead of searching and giving it to someone who might not have taken a days meal someone who is hungry have you stopped by to cheer the weeping child of a beggar see if he needed medicines milk or something important small things little gestures but we ignore them we never notice other peoples pains
4142288 the situations i just described put us in a position of power if we help it would be a miracle for the sufferers and to them we would be gods who took care of their desperate need of that moment
4142289 so what do you have to say mr bamba i recall you wanted spirituality to be practical any ideas
4142290 if you feel sorry for what has happened then you can enrol for a workshop ill be holding
4142291 from tomorrow i am going to conduct a practical workshop for spiritual improvement would it interest you
4142292 will it teach us how to improve as people practically
4142293 yes my intent will be to free you as a bird i will even call it operation free bird
4142294 tomorrow morning we will start a journey to ganapati phule in ratnagiri on foot
4142295 the conditions for this free seminar are that you will carry nothing with you no suitcases no water bottles no beddings you can carry a thin towel and a spare set of clothes and undergarments stuff these in your pockets or tie them on your waist with any medicines you may need no bags not allowed well get rid of all the excess baggage we carry most of the time
4142296 i havent finished you will carry no money with you no credit cards no cell phones or beddings and be forewarned we are not going to make any advance provisions for food or shelter well have to find them on our own and without any help
4142297 now let me see how many of you wish to benefit from this practical spiritual workshop
4142298 how does a bird survive every day of its life
4142299 what does it take from its nest money water food nothing at all yet it survives not only the day but also all its life cant you try to move without material belongings for a few days
4142300 in our anxieties and worries we have forgotten what it is to live spontaneously we have become so insecure that we surround ourselves with more than is good for us we keep hoarding more than we will ever need and we plan plan and plan but never seem to live life our tomorrows have killed our todays if not your entire life try to live every day of this journey with me without a care of the future
4142301 sitting here and listening to discourses wont be as useful as this journey because it will help you evolve and mature if you have to become spiritual you have to be detached from all that you cling
4142302 we begin our journey tomorrow then at five o clock you can drop out of the journey any time you feel you have about twelve hours to convince yourselves your wife your parents or children
4142303 but the rich villagers dont they are suspicious about its quality and drink only filtered water
4142304 are you suggesting we drink even dirty water just because we are spiritual and expect god to care of us
4142305 they call it manipulated extrapolation of an argument to suit ones thought you forget that most of the villagers drink this water so at least it cant be rotten
4142306 even if many people drink this water its quality may still not be good
4142307 people regularly fall ill every year drinking water even from certified sources we can argue to any lengths but how to differentiate between the truth and unreasonable anxiety
4142308 i wish to go home i am afraid i cant drink this water
4142309 but why dont you drink that water and stay with us
4142310 have you fallen ill in the past from drinking contaminated water
4142311 once very badly i landed in the hospital for a month due to lead poisoning
4142312 have you ever fallen ill after taking food cooked outside your home
4142313 lead cannot be eliminated by boiling or by cooking so whenever you ate outside you drank water that could have been contained by lead
4142314 so you are not afraid of lead poisoning through water in the food you consume outside your home as much as you are afraid of drinking unfiltered water the doctors warned you about water and you accepted the warning at its face value they didnt warn you of food so that didnt worry you also you forget the words most probably used by the doctors
4142315 so you can go back now and live forever with that fear or you can try breaking that fear isnt that the reason why you are here to get over the fear of uncertainty hunger cold shelter and security none of us know where we are going to eat today if at all we shall get to eat we dont know if we shall get quilts to sleep in the night why do you wish to continue clinging to a fear of yours when you can shed it easily why not surrender it to the feet of the almighty
4142316 i might die i was very close to death the last time
4142317 death is close to us always why choose to live constantly under its fear death comes only once but its fear makes us die a thousand times ironically we do not fear death as much as we fear the fear of death
4142318 instead of judging him we should take this as an opportunity to analyse our deepest fears
4142319 though we may not have the fear of drinking this water some of us fear losing the people we love this fear can become an obsession others might have an exaggerated fear of losing their wealth most of us fear for our health looks positions jobs or fame in case of vipul his fear became visible first he may have the fear of water but not i repeat not the other fears that we might have
4142320 do not criticize vipul because there is much to criticize in all of us you dont scorn or get angry with a one year old child if he refuses to walk or walks awkwardly you deal him with patience and because you know how easy walking is you also understand the childs fears so knowledge should bring along with it compassion and understanding it is ignorance which brings the worst in all of us
4142321 the spirit of surrender is all that i have with me and the belief that he will provide what we require lets walk a little further
4142322 i think its time to try our luck and ask for a meal
4142323 we are pilgrims on a spiritual journey with no money can we still get some food
4142324 forgive me swami ji for coming late from the city but you cannot leave from my dhaba without eating your lunch
4142325 i am a follower of yourswhen you stopped at my dhaba for lunch my servant didnt know who you were and you did not wait for me enough come back you cant leave on a hungry stomach
4142326 god bless your spirit to serve i thank you on the behalf of the whole group whose appetite you took care of we would like to do something for you as a repayment to the meal you served tell us do any job or chore and we shall do it willingly
4142327 i would still like to do something for you because you saved the day for us diwakar because many people within this group were worried for food
4142328 if you wish to repay then i would like you to sing a bhajan here at my hotel
4142329 now i know why you are carrying this guitar with you
4142330 i think it is like a part of you you will be incomplete without it
4142331 you see so easily what i took many years to find
4142332 we are pilgrims on a journey to ratnagiri and need shelter would you be kind enough to give us refuge for the night
4142333 wait you can do no harm by staying here for one night come in
4142334 are you sure you wont be in trouble for this
4142335 i dont think my master will mind even if he scolds me it will still be one person suffering instead of so many of you
4142336 you ask for shelter and refuse food do you want me to sin by leaving you hungry while we eat food
4142337 yes since it gets really cold during the nights we gave her the spare hall to keep her warm

4142366 we were having a hard discussion about whether we could continue together under one roof
4142367 he and i have discussed this horrible incident and he says it was just his australian manner and some humour however the mood and tone was all serious and i was devastated
4142368 throughout 2006 and 2007 i observed and objected to him offering our children beer from beer bottles and ice from scotch glasses
4142369 throughout the marriage i have protested his objections to things like the kids brushing their teeth going to the pediatrician for check ups having innoculations using sun block keeping a schedule and car seats fitting securely
4142370 she is a very competitive person this is the cause of her success on the tennis court
4142371 we do sample airworthiness bulletins when we do maintenance audits but we can only sample them
4142372 so there is no way we can audit every ad airworthiness directive they currently have
4142373 thats still being looked at obviously some part of the translation of the
4142374 there has been too much cost cutting and not enough attention to quality
4142375 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan
4142376 the only way they would have been compensated would have been that 55 million
4142377 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual

4142381 hes going to get back to us in a couple of weeks
4142382 im really confident its going to be resolved amicably before training camp
4142383 oh the glory of your presence we your children give you reverence so arise to your rest and be blessed by our praise as we glory in your embrace as your presence now fills this place
4142384 im hoping to have something here in the next couple of weeks make my decision and go forward with it
4142385 when i talked to francois giguere avalanche gm in june we both understood that the team was going to go forward regardless of what my decision was going to be and that enables me to take as much time as i could
4142386 summers gone by pretty fast and im going to make my decision here pretty shortly
4142387 dean is a combination of thought and torment that has made him write more than a bakers dozen of fine poems he might produce a collection that could astound us all
4142388 unlike other crimes where there were criminal associates involved and information coming in there was no evidence to really grasp in the pigout case
4142389 armed robbery detectives were out rattling cages but nobody knew who these ghosts were
4142390 there were a lot of similarities to pigout including the use of grey duct tape to tie up victims
4142391 we always had concerns about the stakeout plan i remember going to a briefing conducted by det sgt mark butterworth and there was a huge emphasis on safety and awareness
4142392 i remember butterworth being very emphatic about these issues and the dangers of the mission
4142393 sometimes if crooks knew silky was on the case they would ring in to the police station to save themselves some hassle
4142394 rod was good at talking to people which is what the art of policing is all about
4142395 i lit up a smoke at that point and after a short time we heard a volley of gunshots and saw the muzzle flash
4142396 i wasnt sure but for some reason i thought we were being shot at
4142397 steam was still coming out of their silk and millers sedan tail pipe and the blue light attached to the roof was still spinning around
4142398 it was eerie there was nobody around we thought we were going to get shot there were 101 scenarios running through our heads
4142399 mark butterworth and i walked towards the body on the ground we could see that it was silky and that he was dead i was saying it cant be silky but i knew it was
4142400 once that sank in the next thing that dawned on us was where the f s rod we sent people off left right and centre to try and find him
4142401 some time after carmel arrived the doctor came out and looked at her and said are you mrs miller have you been told anything and she said no
4142402 the doctor walked away and came back a couple of minutes later and said im sorry carmel stood up and collapsed
4142403 there was a lot of emotion and we decided to let the family view miller we gave strict instructions that they werent to touch him except carmel who was allowed to cradle his head
4142404 it was the longest walk i can remember from the altar to the hearse and then out the police academy gates and down view mount rd
4142405 it seemed like miles i remember the faces on all the police members lining the route i remember the cemetery silkys family
4142406 i remember having a can of ouzo and coke with the other pallbearers in the car park of the pub after the funeral in memory of silky
4142407 seem to target evangelical christians in profoundly disturbing ways using language and imagery that would have a special effect on evangelicals inspiring anxiety of the most primal spiritual form fear of the anti christ
4142408 i am not 100 convinced it is him but i think it is very likely
4142409 according to the book of revelations the anti christ is the anti christ will be a man in his 40s of muslim descent who will deceive the nations with persuasive language and have a massive christ like appeal the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace and when he is in power will destroy everything
4142410 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
4142411 theres there is no doubt that the ad plays effectively on evangelical fears of the antichrist and a one world government
4142412 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
4142413 i dont know i do a lot of talk shows
4142414 it was great i love ireland where did you say you where from
4142415 back at the barnyard is a cartoon its on saturday mornings and the supreme court of comedy is an exclusive direct t v produced show
4142416 i love performing in front of people but after an audience comes in to see me i dont feel comfortable pushing my latest dvd after they spent their money to see me perform
4142417 taking credit for that is like taking credit for whats up its just a common term in italian households that got blown up because of the sopranos
4142418 i was part of an improv group and i had a lot of fun
4142419 i didnt make the cut but i found comedy again
4142420 i work a lot but i also take time off lay around
4142421 one of my buddies from philly fran ohanlon is a coach at lafayette
4142422 i cant wait i heard they worked wonders out there at that place after the show lets get a drink
4142423 nope unfortunately i am not come to think of it thats probably what coo ray halbritter said when he heard they got denied
4142424 what separates poetry from religious dogma is the ability of a poem to speak across time to everyone no matter their world view
4142425 care for its communities through partnerships and the pursuit of excellence
4142426 i think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers
4142427 wealthy people come to london or already exist in london they want to buy properties like we go to the shops to buy a suit or a tie and the thought of having to wait six months or three years is too much for them
4142428 time is money to most of them its find something thats ready lets go for it
4142429 when i started you counted on your fingers the number of 1m and i mean 1m properties now the market goes up to 100m
4142430 there are certainly quite a few sales that i have been involved around 50m
4142431 the apartments start at approximately 5m 2 5m and how high do they go you can use your imagination but we have had many sales over 40m
4142432 were sold out now so we sold 2bn of apartments in about two years
4142433 we have three floors of maid suites those are all about 600 sq ft 56 sq m there are some that are a 1 000 sq ft 93 sq m and those were sold out immediately
4142434 the places where we are producing best are actually in our very large units we sold a unit in trump world tower for 39m
4142435 we have an apartment in trump park avenue for 45m and those are the things that are seeing the most interest because as the economy waxes and wanes there still tend to be people in that top one percentile
4142436 for them its almost irrelevant meaning theyre not affected by the sub prime crisis they are not worried about getting a mortgage
4142437 its difficult to know for sure but probably you have more insurance if you like buying at that end of the market so its not so much of your wealth
4142438 its part of your investment portfolio but its not a huge part
4142439 i think for most people losing your job means that you struggle to meet your mortgage payments and as a result the housing market is very sensitive to the economic cycle
4142440 if its only one of your properties or only a part of your portfolio it may well be that you can get through an economic cycle without missing out on those payments that you owe

4142467 puesto que las tres alianzas globales de aerol neas se regir n por las mismas normas y supondr un nuevo impulso en el proceso de consolidaci n tan necesario en nuestra industria

4142471 el riesgo de expropiaci n en las concesiones compartir beneficia a todos
4142472 est claro que me gusta que entren los tiros pero no es lo que m s me preocupa me preocupan mis sensaciones me preocupa ser til al equipo creo que los puntos y el tiro son una faceta importante para un equipo y que si a veces no est s acertado concentras tus energ as en otras cosas
4142473 a lo mejor he llamado un poco m s la atenci n porque han entrado un par de tiros pero en los dos primeros partidos casi no he anotado y creo que he ayudado al equipo cada d a estoy preparado y en una cancha de baloncesto hay muchas cosas que hacer adem s de meter puntos
4142474 son muy buen equipo y a las nueve de la ma ana es inc modo jugar para todos tampoco es para tirar cohetes pero estamos contentos de lo que hemos hecho en el encuentro

4142476 direct selling is a great model with high gross margins low capital intensity lots of free cash flow
4142477 its a fragmented industry with gigantic room for growth the top 15 players only account for about half the market
4142478 in all honesty direct selling is hot because its a fun convenient way to shop that people enjoy so poor economic times or not people find direct selling to be appealing great products personal service and income potential are elements of direct selling that make it a strong economic contender at all times
4142479 people motivated to get started in direct selling typically share certain attributes
4142480 most seek supplemental income either short term or long term the social aspect also is appealing for those who love to meet new people and many enjoy buying products and services they already use at a discount

4142510 to those of us in the west who feel a calling to offer a different kind of message to same sex couples there is a sense in which the whole church wants to hem us in and prevent us from following that calling
4142511 we know the world is in flux particularly on this issue
4142512 so we do this not as an act of disrespect to the people of africa or the people of other parts of the united states but as a way of speaking the christian gospel compassionately to a group of people who deal with this every day

4142579 for instance if pat kenny was to interview an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside ireland

4142605 most parents and young adults are getting along well together and most parents are involved in their childrens lives
4142606 but many parents underestimate the extent to which young people value their relationships with them
4142607 were at the stage where we can actually really enjoy our relationships
4142608 i wanted to cry but i wanted to be stoic
4142609 i remember ms belinda brown my surgeon passing the tissues to me and saying youre allowed to cry
4142610 i felt very very supported i was overwhelmed by the number of people who contacted me and it was just incredible to experience that level of support
4142611 at the same time this was happening to me and i felt sad i felt angry i was asking myself why did this have to happen why to me then i realised it happens to lots of women
4142612 ils nont rien voulu savoir nous allons donc durcir nos actions la semaine prochaine avec des blocages de camions et dusines
4142613 life is like a box of chocolates you never know how much youre going to eat
4142614 we will play to a little older audience than pineapple express so we should do better on saturday and get to about the same box office
4142615 unlike other crimes where there were criminal associates involved and information coming in there was no evidence to really grasp in the pigout case
4142616 armed robbery detectives were out rattling cages but nobody knew who these ghosts were
4142617 there were a lot of similarities to pigout including the use of grey duct tape to tie up victims
4142618 we always had concerns about the stakeout plan i remember going to a briefing conducted by det sgt mark butterworth and there was a huge emphasis on safety and awareness
4142619 i remember butterworth being very emphatic about these issues and the dangers of the mission
4142620 sometimes if crooks knew silky was on the case they would ring in to the police station to save themselves some hassle
4142621 rod was good at talking to people which is what the art of policing is all about
4142622 i lit up a smoke at that point and after a short time we heard a volley of gunshots and saw the muzzle flash
4142623 i wasnt sure but for some reason i thought we were being shot at
4142624 steam was still coming out of their silk and millers sedan tail pipe and the blue light attached to the roof was still spinning around
4142625 it was eerie there was nobody around we thought we were going to get shot there were 101 scenarios running through our heads
4142626 mark butterworth and i walked towards the body on the ground we could see that it was silky and that he was dead i was saying it cant be silky but i knew it was
4142627 once that sank in the next thing that dawned on us was where the f s rod we sent people off left right and centre to try and find him
4142628 some time after carmel arrived the doctor came out and looked at her and said are you mrs miller have you been told anything and she said no
4142629 the doctor walked away and came back a couple of minutes later and said im sorry carmel stood up and collapsed
4142630 there was a lot of emotion and we decided to let the family view miller we gave strict instructions that they werent to touch him except carmel who was allowed to cradle his head
4142631 it was the longest walk i can remember from the altar to the hearse and then out the police academy gates and down view mount rd
4142632 it seemed like miles i remember the faces on all the police members lining the route i remember the cemetery silkys family
4142633 i remember having a can of ouzo and coke with the other pallbearers in the car park of the pub after the funeral in memory of silky

4142644 john kerry can and will fight for the truth on cable news but we need all of us to battle against the smears in every way
4142645 this site is designed for activists like you to take back the truth from the bush mccain politics of karl rove that have come to dominate the gop so sign up and join in the fight and start reporting in some smears
4142646 it is our hope that we can play a role in exposing the methods and goals of those who smear democrats so that we can decide our elections on the issues and values that matter to americans
4142647 in hindsight we made a mistake in not responding more forcefully
4142648 right now i would be very aggressive with reporters and factually going through the book corsis and responding and making it clear that this is a bunch of bullsh t
4142649 like his other books corsis book is littered with lies and distortions
4142650 the best seller status of the book was achieved through the use of large bulk purchases this is a common tactic of the smear machine the publisher of this book is a company headed up by dick cheneys long time spokesperson mary matalin
4142651 the obama campaign is going to have to decide if they are going to go after this who is going to do it and to what extent they are going to do that because they have to be careful not to blow it up
4142652 obamas campaign has to absolutely make sure they can respond to every charge and make sure they have all the research on this because the lack of this research was an enormous impediment to responding to the ads and the swift boat book
4142653 do you know where you end up if you dont study if you arent smart if youre intellectually lazy you end up getting us stuck in a war in iraq
4142654 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4142655 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4142656 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4142657 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4142658 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4142659 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4142660 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4142661 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4142662 dass die mehrheit in solchen f llen die minderheit v llig blockieren kann birgt in diesem bereich mehrere gefahren erstens werden dem volk dadurch oft ergebnisse vorenthalten die auf unpopul ren oder unbekannten ideen beruhen nur weil die mehrheit angst vor dem unbekannten hat zweitens sind gesellschaften die nur mehrheitsentscheidungen tolerieren oft stagnierende gesellschaften und drittens wird aus einer einmaligen minorit t meist eine st ndige minorit t der dann jede debatte verweigert wird

4142666 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
4142667 and i was supposed to be in love with you
4142668 and i wouldnt say shes toughened up but instead the problems hitting her now have become bigger at first it was learning to use a typewriter and now its a baby with the father of the baby someone she works with
4142669 some people just arent as likable as others no matter what they do pete campbell does the same stuff as don draper but drapers way more likable and gets away with things
4142670 jon is the lead and he always has something going on
4142671 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4142672 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4142673 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4142674 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4142675 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4142676 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4142677 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
4142678 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4142679 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the upset a us nba squad 101 95 in the semi finals of the 2006 worlds and in the first meeting since they stayed within 20 16 after the first quarter before the american stars pulled away for good in the second quarter
4142680 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4142681 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4142682 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4142683 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4142684 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4142685 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4142686 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4142687 if we meet them again its going to be harder to beat us
4142688 bla bla bla falta incentivo bla bla bla investimento bla bla bla formar talentos bla bla bla

4142690 i had to wait until my opponent was right in front of me to be able to make out her face
4142691 yes it was painful and it did affect me a bit
4142692 the people who need visas are all now in baku and we expect the foreign office will complete the paperwork first thing on friday morning so we are very optimistic the game will go ahead
4142693 we are in regular contact with both member associations concerned for that match in swansea
4142694 this is a huge problem in our sport that needs the immediate attention
4142695 there are athletes who have tested positive for drugs retired and are coaching right now
4142696 if you test positive and retire you should be banned from coaching for life
4142697 the reason coaches are good coaches is because they went to school
4142698 there is no other sport in the world that would allow someone to compete one year and coach a professional athlete the next year
4142699 this sport just says oh they are a great coach oh no they are not
4142700 im not qualified to be a coach and i know more than many athletes because i listened to coach tellez his former coach tom tellez
4142701 but if i wanted to coach i would go back to college i went to massage therapy school and finished so i understand the body systems but if i wanted to coach i would need to go back to college and get more background
4142702 we dont need athletes being coached by people who are inexperienced otherwise we are going to have athletes hurt because their coach doesnt understand the physiology of the body
4142703 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4142704 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4142705 we went big on patents and metallics a look thats big with our customers right now
4142706 happiness comes from within im not looking 4 the one i can live with or the one i cant live without im looking 4 the one who completes me im not one of those huge breasted women sorry but i do have some lol
4142707 the big philly cheesesteak is every meat lovers dream with lots of steak smothered in melted cheese its easy to see why this classic is the taste that philly is so proud of
4142708 a plan to build a plan to put hard working americans first
4142709 hell put the middle class ahead of corporate interests to grow the economy end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas help businesses that create jobs here invest in education cut taxes for working families and make energy independence an urgent national priority
4142710 a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage
4142711 an organic chicken in every pot and an electric car in every garage
4142712 for instance if pat kenny was to interview an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside ireland
4142713 realistically this means we need to block all live streams radio and television because we cannot monitor all of the streams 24 hours

4142925 theres still no word on whether the schellinger will be endorsing jill long thompson in her bid to unseat daniels this fall

4142929 we start from florida then work our way up to michigan then slowly work our way back down
4142930 it took my sister leaving for me to actually do it because her cats were already combined to her
4142931 itd be very awkward for a new person to come in and try and take over
4142932 my dad works with them but he worked with her for a long time
4142933 its basically a lot of patience its a lot of give and take
4142934 it has its ups and downs like everything else you have to know when to stop
4142935 youve got to know when theyre done if theyre irritated if their tails wagging theyre already done they want to go home
4142936 sometimes theyre ready theyre set theyre frisky and then sometimes theyre happy to be there they dont want any trouble its just like people some days you want to be at work some days you dont
4142937 with animals theres really basically never a day off they come before you
4142938 i enjoy it if you really like what you do youll be happy
4142939 i missed out on the social life of having friends
4142940 ive had friends but i have more family my familys closer to me than friends would be
4142941 i dont know really because itd be hard to leave
4142942 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit
4142943 it is critical for canadians to have trust in the conduct of judges especially the chief justice of the supreme court of canada by willfully breaching the requirements of the constitution of the order of canada and the judicial standards of conduct beverley mclachlin compromises the integrity of canadas judicial system the behaviour of beverley mclachlin outside the courtroom clearly demonstrates bias along with improper conduct driven by political ideology or personal agenda
4142944 the silence of the gg and the chief judge raises more doubt and mistrust about who we are dealing with here and what they have done that is why we need an investigation
4142945 in order to preserve the integrity of canadas judicial system we respectfully ask that the canadian judicial council consider this complaint seriously investigate beverley mclachlins inappropriate behaviour and recommend to parliament that ms mclachlin be sanctioned or removed from office
4142946 headlining the millennium stadium and las vegas were great the garden is the last thing left
4142947 roy is one of the best in history and the garden is boxings greatest venue if you cant get excited by that youre in the wrong sport
4142948 the doctors have given my wrist the all clear ive been well rested and have 12 weeks to go thats perfect
4142949 ill never forgive myself if i lose my last fight having been undefeated for the last 17 years
4142950 show me the money is all i have to say well have to wait and see
4142951 ive achieved everything its dangerous to fight on if your hearts not in it
4142952 ill stay around the gym when i retire maybe concentrate on promoting well see how it goes its not like i have to rush into a day job
4142953 but for now i know that im still a fighter and that ive got to go into the ring on 8 november ready to kick arse
4142954 at first i was terrified to ride it but now i do it for enjoyment
4142955 we could have been doing this for a long time any exercise you can do even if its just a short distance is better than not at all
4142956 its so much quicker to ride a bike to work than to drive
4142957 i feel ive already lost weight it gets my blood pumping in the mornings and im ready to go to work i feel less wasteful and there are no carbon emissions
4142958 i think more people are exploring it as an option
4142959 we stop and talk to people and theres a nice community feeling about it i think bicycling makes you feel a little more connected to the community in a strange sort of way
4142960 im fitting into clothes i havent been able to wear in several years
4142961 i am noticing a lot more people riding around town on bicycles probably because of the price of gasoline
4142962 thats good except some of them havent been on a bike in a long time and probably arent quite sure what their rights and responsibilities are
4142963 riding against traffic or swerving erratically on and off sidewalks i think this increases the likelihood of conflicts between cars and bikes one of the key things to being safe is to be predictable and if youre in a car youre not expecting a bike to be coming against traffic
4142964 its a great thing that more people are getting out on bicycles but i would just hate to see somebody get hurt or have a bad conflict with a driver
4142965 i like it because it gets the blood flowing before i get to work it does give you energy its good exercise and its just fun
4142966 now most people i know who live in south frankfort or downtown ride a bike it makes getting to work so much more enjoyable than sitting in a car in traffic its fun to feel the wind in your face its good for your health and being a dance teacher it helps keep me in shape
4142967 and there is a sense of community built around people who ride bikes we have wonderful parks too
4142968 i spend 2 a week on gas its been a very good conversation piece and ive met so many new friends since i bought it
4142969 for those who want to play and see the town
4142970 for the serious bikers i send them to capital city cycles
4142971 just a piece of the puzzle a small part of it
4142972 this is the first year ive seen people actually buying bikes to commute as opposed to talking about doing it
4142973 freedom of choice as an important safeguard against the bias confusion and self interest of government
4142974 hatred for these kurfa rising with the knowledge of his own weakness
4142975 podcasts are still like bigfoot to me i am sure they are out there but not sure i want to know about them and they scare me a little

4142978 the government of sudan has attacked our places with 300 vehicles they have been here for three days protecting chinese oil workers
4142979 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4142980 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4142981 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4142982 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4142983 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4142984 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4142985 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4142986 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4142987 i am proud to have been chosen to sing at all

4142990 this has no relevance to causation of human skin cancer and does not prove in any way whatever that moisturising creams are cancer causing in humans
4142991 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4142992 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4142993 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4142994 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4142995 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4142996 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4142997 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go
4142998 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills
4142999 im here to nurture inventors and point them in the right direction you never know whats coming through the door
4143000 were a different breed from the victorians we have to be more commercially viable

4143005 we took bemax resources from a tenement on a map to around the fourth or the fifth largest producer of titanium dioxide and around the sixth largest producer of zircon in the world although our expectations arent to target the same prominence in the oil and gas sector we believe with our team there are interesting aggregation opportunities to build substantial energy operations primarily in the usa

4143008 nonostante la minore incidentalit la patente a punti lindennizzo diretto la severa sanzione dellantitrust al cartello assicurativo per 370 milioni di euro comminata nel 2001 dicono adusbef e federconsumatori non esiste alcuna speranza di invertire la lievitazione spaventosa delle polizze rc auto senza interventi seri e rigorosi che anche nel 2008 continueranno la loro sfrenata corsa con un 5 45 euro mentre le polizze dei motorini subiranno un salasso del 7 5 30 euro le lettere che molti utenti stanno ricevendo in questi giorni a giustificazione dei salassi del 10 15 per assicurati che non hanno denunciato alcun sinistro che deriverebbero dai maggiori costi dellindennizzo diretto che come noto evidenziano fa risparmiare oneri al sistema tra 1 5 e 2 miliardi di euro lanno

4143010 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4143011 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4143012 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4143013 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4143014 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4143015 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4143016 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4143017 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4143018 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines

4143020 if not for the cameras my client is definitely facing life in prison
4143021 for whatever reason in this case we had several witnesses say that my client kept hitting the victim after he was down stomping on his face
4143022 i can think of seven or eight off the top of my head
4143023 i am talking about identification of suspects as a direct result of the cameras
4143024 it should be retained for a longer period of time it may take three or four days for them to catch somebody and then to process it and by then boom its deleted
4143025 these days you can store the encyclopedia on the head of a pin
4143026 it is a matter of providing the best possible evidence in this case you have a situation where the cameras captured in greater detail the crime itself
4143027 and he has made it clear that the surveillance cameras are not to be monitored
4143028 one of our claims to fame in the police department
4143029 is our response to a priority calls our standard is three minutes it is possible if wed had the potential to divert police to the scene the consequences could have been reduced
4143030 i thought for the first day in full pads it was a good day
4143031 of course we have a lot of things to work on but overall our effort was good
4143032 it was good in places and then i didnt think we played with a lot of intensity once we scrimmaged a little bit i was disappointed in that but we will coach them up and get them better tomorrow
4143033 i came here with the mission to help get the team back to into the rankings and we have still yet to do that i am setting out to do anything i possibly can to help get us back into the rankings that is one of the main reasons i returned for my senior season i didnt want to leave the program without accomplishing the main goal i set out to accomplish
4143034 as a personal goal i want to crack the rankings and do whatever it takes to get to the ncaa tournament it doesnt matter if i make it by being ranked or by having a solid conference tournament i always try to set out to win in the conference tourney though my personal goals are important they arent as important as my overall team goals the team comes first
4143035 it has really been a different overall experience when i came here in the fall of 2006 i was fascinated with how nice and helpful everyone around the university and the city were i have been really impressed with the attention that the athletic department puts on the student athletes and everything that the athletic department does to help us with anything and everything that we need we dont have anything like it in germany in germany you really dont have the opportunity to be a student athlete the focus is either put on the student part or on the athlete part their really isnt an in between
4143036 it is really all about good time management skills as a student athlete one really needs to have a lot of focus and be able to stay organized being part of the tennis team has really helped me stay focused in the classroom
4143037 tennis wise their really hasnt been that much of a difference the differences come in the academic area the junior college classes are a lot easier than anything you take at the university of memphis also it is a lot more professional at memphis and we have a lot more support from the athletic department as student athletes
4143038 they were really the driving force behind everything they always taught me to take advantage of all the opportunities that are presented to you so when the opportunity at memphis was presented to me i jumped at it i am glad i did because i love the university of memphis and the tennis program now my parents just have to get used to because i intend on staying here long after college
4143039 hes already had a lot of really good ideas for the team and hes a great guy to bring back to be around our guys
4143040 im excited for the opportunity to be a role model for these young men like many coaches and older players were to me during my collegiate tennis years
4143041 their are not many opportunities to coach college athletics and i am excited that this one was presented to me the chance to work with coach goebel who coached me is one that i couldnt pass up their is not a coach who cares more for his players out there
4143042 i am really kind of disappointed right now because it seems we have some guys who have some tweaks about them that are not practicing
4143043 i am a little disappointed in some of their mental toughness right now i know who is working their tail off right now like our running backs we are working three backs right now and they are working their tails off going on special teams
4143044 we have to get everybody out here pulling their load
4143045 it is too easy just to not practice right now i want people to be out here fighting for jobs the guys who are out here are the ones who are going to play in the opening game
4143046 there were a lot of mistakes way too many mistakes offensively
4143047 i am really shocked we put the ball on the ground twice a quarterback and a back put the ball on the ground and we had a couple of picks we have to get that corrected i thought we were poor in the offensive line and disappointing from an intensity level i didnt think we came to play up front offensively and it showed
4143048 we still have learning to get in the right places overall i liked the intensity defensively the only thing that hurt on defense today were penalties we had them stopped on third down twice and had penalties that resulted in first downs
4143049 it didnt hurt us to come in here and get some team stuff done
4143050 we have a lot of depth in the d line but not a lot of depth in the o line
4143051 i felt like we were one guy short on the left side of the offensive line
4143052 up to this point we have looked very good playing against ourselves in camp but we are going to be playing against the best this week
4143053 the timing is great to play this caliber of a team because we still have quite a bit of time before the regular season starts these games will be tests that we will be able to draw a lot of evaluations from hopefully we will get a lot out of this experience and well see what we need to work on afterwards
4143054 weve always wanted to play someone that highly ranked in the country and we feel that we can compete but we have never got that opportunity until now
4143055 the girls are ecstatic they get to play at that level i think were going into this with confidence from what we accomplished last year and how we have performed through preseason
4143056 they are two of our best players all conference players and they are a big part of our midfield our other players came out and did a wonderful job but i do think that did affect us and the flow of the game
4143057 it is a credit to our kids that they kept fighting and they were not intimidated
4143058 we had some chances and we fought hard we feel as if notre dame is one of the best teams we play this season and we can look back at this match and say that we can play with the best and we should ultimately be able to contend with everybody on our schedule
4143059 we are in the first week of the season and we immediately play one of the top teams in the country
4143060 the better team did win the game today but we took a lot out of the game there were several positives we can take away and there are also many things we need to work on but most of all it was a great opportunity for us to get most of our players on the field to play against a quality opponent we are looking forward to building on this game and we can now look forward to our next test thursday which will be another tough game for us against western kentucky
4143061 there can be no more fatal error to the justice system than the public perception of the notion that judges can be removed at the will of the executive branch if things arent going their way
4143062 should not be allowed to benefit from media characterizations that they helped to create
4143063 judge brownback was not yielding to the position that the government wanted him to take
4143064 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4143065 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

4143072 its funny how its only the bloggers that didnt attend the event are trying to portray it as some kind of all out war despite the mike jones trae skirmish and dj vlad confronting rick ross he shouldve known better the weekend went really really smoothly
4143073 it was a lot more organized than previous years and truthfully the problems we had at the start of the awards were caused by the houston police dept and we are considering legal action but the overwhelming majority of attendees were pleased at the networking they accomplished the fun they had at the parties and the performances at the award show im actually really surprised at how so many websites are trying to spin this into something negative
4143074 it seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question
4143075 this was expected but whereas many pirates who debate the issue online are often abusive and aggressive on the topic most of the drm complaints were reasonable and well put
4143076 people dont like drm we knew that but the extent to which drm is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it these gamers are the low hanging fruit of this whole debate
4143077 ive read enough otherwise honest people complain about drm to see that its probably hurting more than it helps i had planned on using the same system for kudos 2 but ive changed my mind on that i have also removed it from democracy 2 today i now use no drm at all
4143078 enough people out there see price as a factor to change my mind i halved the price of
4143079 doubtless there will be more fps games requiring mainframes to run them more games with securom games with no demos or games with all glitz and no gameplay i wish this wasnt the case and that the devs could listen more to their potential customers and that the pirates could listen more to the devs rather than abusing them i dont think thats going to happen
4143080 one thing led to another and i ended up working there
4143081 i regurgitated all the way home from warner robins to milledgeville

4143084 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4143085 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4143086 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4143087 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4143088 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4143089 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design

4143100 no man in history including jesus christ has directly revealed to the world the satanic weapon used to enslave mankind intellectual thought
4143101 they thought i was fair game i was an instrument of purpose to achieve their desires and not 100 percent real and also that they had me by the short curlies because i thought that the world revolved around them and therefore i think that i am fair game and rightly so if they want to play dirty i get to too its not a one way street i will use the physcial strength that i have over them my superior 4

4143108 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
4143109 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh
4143110 a demonstration should turn you on not turn you off
4143111 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all

4143114 immorality the morality of those who are having a better time
4143115 my own opinion even speaking as a woman is that no more female input should be allowed in establishing and enforcing the rules and regulations of a men group if this is to be a haven for men to discuss mens issues then women shouldnt be designing the room and painting it pink and putting up lace curtains and a lot of frilly doilies jmo

4143127 ive lost my faith in marriage most of my generation their parents are divorced as are mine and i see so many people break up
4143128 as for my idealisation of what a relationship should look like that has vanished i dont see many couples or marriages i can use as a compass point not many people stick it out any more i have learnt to cope by myself
4143129 i guess i have become a little cynical but i would like more children
4143130 i felt like god wanted me to come over and talk to you i think you know my name otherwise you wouldnt be here getting a picture of me

4143133 no man in history including jesus christ has directly revealed to the world the satanic weapon used to enslave mankind intellectual thought
4143134 they thought i was fair game i was an instrument of purpose to achieve their desires and not 100 percent real and also that they had me by the short curlies because i thought that the world revolved around them and therefore i think that i am fair game and rightly so if they want to play dirty i get to too its not a one way street i will use the physcial strength that i have over them my superior 4

4143141 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
4143142 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh
4143143 a demonstration should turn you on not turn you off
4143144 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all

4143147 immorality the morality of those who are having a better time
4143148 my own opinion even speaking as a woman is that no more female input should be allowed in establishing and enforcing the rules and regulations of a men group if this is to be a haven for men to discuss mens issues then women shouldnt be designing the room and painting it pink and putting up lace curtains and a lot of frilly doilies jmo

4143165 pearls of guidance from the pious salaf of this ummah
4143166 this knowledge is religion so look to where you take your religion
4143167 our brothers for the sake of allaah as salafiyyoon the brothers at al maktabatus salafiyyah and islamic centre salafi publications in the city of birmingham in great britain then they are mentioned with goodness and love for the sunnah and calling to it and for waging war against bidah and partisanship hizbiyyah
4143168 indeed salafi publications is a blessed maktabah and i have taught there on numerous occasions over several years i do not know them except to be upon the correct way and the correct methodology and the sunnah up until this day and i have not seen from them any extremism or any harshness
4143169 i have known al maktabah as salafiyyah in birmingham britain for many years and they and all priase is due to allaah are upon the manhaj and upon goodness and we do not know from them except goodness
4143170 and i am thankful to the brothers in charge of this maktabah as salafiyyah due to what they have established by their efforts in the path of dawah to goodness and guidance and dawah to the people to the religion the religion of islaam and their dawah to the muslims to the way of the truth the path of ahlus sunnah ahlul hadeeth wal athar
4143171 we are very very busy and trying the best we can to keep up with business
4143172 nobody could do anything for us even my own mortgage company wouldnt even try
4143173 took the time to make it work even if at times i was thinking that it was taking forever they were very patient and did what they had to do

4143179 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things
4143180 chelsea have made it known to us that he is indispensable
4143181 we will not play as badly as that again we must improve and we will improve
4143182 it was a bad performance we tried to do our best and it was not good enough
4143183 the forwards just did not have enough of the ball and our man of the match was pepe reina that says everything about us
4143184 we will need a big improvement at anfield we know we did not play our best game against liege we know that as a team
4143185 we struggled we could not pass the ball to our team mates anywhere near enough
4143186 it was a difficult night and difficult to know what really went wrong but the good thing was a clean sheet and that will give us the edge in a fortnight for the second leg
4143187 we know it was not our best game but we want to step things up and we know there is quality in the team we have shown that in pre season and now we must show it in competitive matches too
4143188 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4143189 now we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game at sunderland to show who we are and what we are
4143190 as for the champions league fortunately we are still in the tie but we definitely have to show better form than we showed in liege we need to score we have to play better and we will
4143191 you must give credit to liege because they were aggressive competitive and played very well
4143192 it is different to playing pre season friendlies but we were lucky and the only good thing was that we did not concede a goal
4143193 but we know now what we have to do at anfield we will have had a few more competitive games and we will have a more people available
4143194 javier mascherano lucas leiva and ryan babel will be back with us fabio aurelio should be fit by then and steven gerrard will also be available and fully fit this time as will martin skrtel
4143195 we were fortunate we have to thank pepe reina and make sure we are really ready for the next game
4143196 the service to the front players was not good enough but it was more than that our passing was poor as was our control and movement
4143197 now everyone the manager coaches and players have to do so much better next time to make sure we get through this round we all know how important it is to reach the group stages
4143198 the next time will be different i am sure of that the understanding between the players particularly the new ones will be better
4143199 there will be more competition in every position by then and that will be good for the team we have to improve and we will improve
4143200 we were aware that liege were good and competitive that was not the surprise the surprise was the performance of my team
4143201 after i thought about it i thought the discipline was sufficient and there was no need to transfer them
4143202 and i clarified those rules to make sure people understand that you just cant do that thats just not permissible period now i dont know who authorized it but whoever did im not going to be happy with
4143203 impose the kind of meaningful discipline that acts as a real deterrent for this kind of behavior by a select group of officers
4143204 ran past a vacant lot where a large party was going on and the officer heard people in the crowd say theyre chasing jamar
4143205 attempted to strangle the officer by choking him with his shirt collar
4143206 that officers who had been involved in a recent highly publicized incident that had been videotaped may also have been involved in this incident and im not sure frankly how something like that could have occurred
4143207 i know paul has always wanted to play in a professional side with his brother
4143208 it nearly happened once for lancashire and thats the nearest hes ever he got
4143209 if i can facilitate that on the correct terms for the club then id love to
4143210 id be excited by the prospect because i can remember paul sculthorpe playing so well over a number of years but obviously the directors are perhaps a little more conservative because there is a question mark at the minute over pauls durability because of his injuries
4143211 thats been reflected in his number of appearances over the last two years those factors will be taken into account but we will be chatting to pauls agent and if we can come to some agreement id be delighted
4143212 ive got a contract here and im very happy here
4143213 weve had two years where the club have been on an upward curve and really this is the first hiccup that weve had
4143214 if they think im going to walk away at the first sign of adversity they have another think coming its just not in my nature
4143215 the report upset me a great deal i dont like things like that affecting my family
4143216 the best thing about this week is that its a five day turnaround because we can get out there and attempt to put things right
4143217 we need the two points to confirm ourselves in the six
4143218 we understand were playing a very very determined wakefield team
4143219 i know their coach has been vigorous with them this week so theyre a dangerous prospect
4143220 its very important to finish in the top two but weve got to play well against castleford first
4143221 all we can do take care of our own backyard saints deserve to be in first spot theyve been playing great football
4143222 theyve been a pleasure to watch and i thought how they finished their game against warrington was class so good luck to them
4143223 that was a really good win for them against wakefield because theyve had trouble with them over the last couple of years
4143224 they had a good win against harlequins away too and this is a great stadium for all clubs to come to
4143225 we feel its the most atmospheric ground in the world of rugby league and its a great place for visitors to come too

4143228 i think theres an impression the deadline is absolute that is not correct
4143229 that deadline was set so we can get an update from applicants about where they are in the process
4143230 i dont disagree that some kind of deadline is needed but this is too quick
4143231 the worst thing we can do for people still in the pipeline is to do anything other than assist them
4143232 if we are to err at this point we should err on the side of people
4143233 we will reconsider the deadline if theres an overall adverse affect
4143234 the problems in the mortgage market have put the nations housing in a downward spiral that will be hard to break
4143235 ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expre allows companies to advertise on the radio
4143236 the as available price is low and nobodys selling i think people will hold on as much as they can
4143237 we have been paying 125 130 t for movement this week and early next week
4143238 the weakness in our market is very much because of the liquidation of wheat from the ukraine
4143239 with the rain as it is today it hardly seems appropriate to be talking about drought
4143240 but its also shown that other predictions from the database are not so reliable
4143241 recruiting is hard its just finding the needles in the haystack
4143242 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
4143243 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

4143248 this is a big help we can now use the money we save on buying school uniforms for appliances for our new flat
4143249 i think its great that we can get school uniforms this way
4143250 children living in shelters have enough difficulties to deal with we want them to be able to focus on what is really important from day one at school their education
4143251 education for young children is so important for me this is a great opportunity to support homeless young kids
4143252 it feels nice because these things look so good on you
4143253 i am really looking forward to making new friends at school
4143254 housing must be available to all americans without regard to disability
4143255 we will continue to pursue those who fail to design and construct accessible housing as required by federal law
4143256 about once a week we get an inquiry about old mill space there are people who prefer those buildings to new offices
4143257 the law as it currently exists could be a vehicle to change the use of a property from industrial to commercial
4143258 the mullaneys do a great job and thats not going to be a renovation of a building its going to be new construction boucher has done a fantastic job of cleaning up the inside of his building
4143259 associated with important persons or groups that shaped the history of your community
4143260 the view and beauty of the greatest town in the world is being destroyed by these supergraphics
4143261 the debate so far has been appalling with tabloid talk of frankenstein foods and so on
4143262 we need a proper debate on this it is imperative that we do the research and this has to be in the public sector not in the private sector where dividends to shareholders are more important scotland should not be left behind
4143263 we have a very clear vision of scotlands future based on clean green quality food produced in scotland
4143264 the problem with gm is that it cuts right across that image and positioning we have for scottish food and scottish farming
4143265 the number of people in the world with an inadequate diet is increasing by 100 million a year i have visited african countries where the land suffers from a monoculture system and children are surviving on one plate of maize porridge a day
4143266 the public perception is against gm but in 10 years time we could be in a world where gm crops are being grown chemical applications are less and varieties are disease and drought resistant
4143267 we believe our estimate of 3 8 million iphones sold in apples september quarter is very conservative
4143268 the last remnant of the old neighborhood and the last building thats not vulcan owned
4143269 we decided to do it with a funny shirt people in seattle cant have a meaningful talk about public transportation these days without talking to those funny guys who made the t shirt
4143270 i didnt think it would be that big a deal but im riding it five times a week the way traffic has been lately you dont want to drive
4143271 chain of blame how wall street caused the mortgage and credit crisis
4143272 its so critical because its not only a housing need but it also helps serve as traffic mitigation to the extent that we can provide housing close to the jobs
4143273 thats the hardest part to get our hands around is how to provide affordable housing

4143275 operation home sweet home targets subtle as well as blatant forms of discrimination
4143276 no person should be prevented from living where he or she chooses because of race or color
4143277 federal law prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of ones race and color
4143278 todays case sheds light on still existing illegal rental practices in our community and confirms our resolve to make housing equally available to all
4143279 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4143280 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4143281 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4143282 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4143283 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4143284 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design
4143285 im blown away every time i walk past that apple store and theres always people queued up outside to get in
4143286 i believe it was mr davis intent and desire that the collection would always remain intact and on public display in claremore oklahoma obviously the foundation has another idea
4143287 they probably picked the most inflammatory picture that they could to put in their press release
4143288 in any museum from what jason tells me you are going to have things that are basically junk jason characterizes anything in a museum as an artifact but because it is an artifact doesnt mean that it has display value
4143289 with gun enthusiasts everywhere the foundation has done a poor job of raising money to assist the museum
4143290 at least i know my sons have a roof over their heads they have food theyre safe
4143291 the immensity of the homeless student population shocked all of us
4143292 after all just a few years ago we had one of the highest income levels in the state
4143293 i think weve come to a time in this region in this county where we are saying that whats happening is not acceptable
4143294 were already spending the money we just dont have the label homeless on it
4143295 how many homeless individuals are incarcerated in seminole county because of a homeless crime loitering panhandling how much do homeless families use our emergency rooms as regular medical care facilities how many millions of dollars are we spending there
4143296 meanwhile the kids are crying and you never know when youre going to be able to get diapers
4143297 lets put on a show for the media and pretend like we actually matter for a change
4143298 the environmental council doesnt set the agenda in lansing interest groups dont get to tell the senate when to come back to session
4143299 we dont come until the 27th unless theres an emergency and i dont think this rises to the level of an emergency whats the point of people yelling fire fire in the theater
4143300 there are things we need to do to help michigan families and we should be doing it
4143301 actually there is some legislation we could be passing that would help
4143302 the left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing
4143303 heyes agreed with the smoking ban and he has not given us the chance to have a say in the matter the ban is killing the trade
4143304 that is tragic news let me get one thing clear i have not set foot in the prince of orange for eight or nine years
4143305 we have one gate in our process we call a styling freeze which is happening in the middle of september
4143306 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
4143307 since the government has not yet made the amended report of the pay commission public the armed forces personnel are not sure if they genuine demands have been met the information and broadcasting minister p r dasmunsis announcements after the cabinet meeting contained only a couple of decisions directly related to the proposals made by the chiefs of staff committee cosc of the armed forces
4143308 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
4143309 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
4143310 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4143311 now its pure principal i was a hillary clinton supporter and this is literally my first touch with the obama campaign and its just disappointing
4143312 because the mind of an over 50 is likely superior to that

4143316 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4143317 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4143318 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4143319 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4143320 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4143321 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4143322 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4143323 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4143324 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4143325 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4143326 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4143327 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4143328 toda ciudadana puede pues decir libremente soy madre de un hijo que os pertenece sin que un prejuicio b rbaro la fuerce a disimular la verdad
4143329 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4143330 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4143334 why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship
4143335 in a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives and in the united states only congress can declare wars
4143336 oh that is all well and good but voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country

4143359 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

4143370 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
4143371 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
4143372 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
4143373 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
4143374 crt is an effective therapy for many patients and this study suggests clinically practice varies greatly compared to what it should be according to recommended guidelines
4143375 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
4143376 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
4143377 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
4143378 african american adolescent females seeking treatment for stds are at high risk for hiv however no interventions have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hiv associated sexual behaviors among this vulnerable subgroup

4143390 the ibm hci study clearly calls for the same rigor in talent analytics and management that ceos and cios require to make the strategic decisions their companies depend on
4143391 the challenge laid out for ibms clients is to treat their most valuable asset their people as their most competitive edge
4143392 the long term payoffs of strong talent management far outweigh the costs and complexities associated with upfront investments
4143393 this research proves that in todays increasingly globalized technology driven economy a strategic and integrated focus on talent can in fact help your organization prepare for corporate adolescence and financially outperform competitors no matter the size or industry
4143394 low speed wind tunnel testing has allowed us to optimize flaps and slats for making our landing and low speed goals achievable

4143418 to accommodate the growing needs of m d anderson now the largest transfusion hospital in the united states we must do everything we can to make donating blood as simple and comfortable as possible for our donors
4143419 this new facility will allow our donors to park near the door walk into a relaxing and streamlined environment and donate either blood or platelets we need and appreciate our donors and this new facility demonstrates how much we value them
4143420 we like to keep at least a three day supply of blood on hand but this summer we have only been able to have a one and one half to two day supply
4143421 many of our patients need blood and platelet transfusions daily or weekly to keep their blood counts up and their treatments on track our blood donors directly impact our patients care
4143422 a number of u s law schools have essentially managed to send a small library of law books to africa

4143451 with this new process we are reducing the travel distance of a space vehicle from 12 000 feet to 10 000 feet
4143452 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
4143453 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
4143454 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings
4143455 we are very pleased that the eu member states have given these active ingredients a positive vote
4143456 products with these active ingredients are critical for securing yields in europe especially cereal yields the decision gives basf the assurance it needs to continue investing in next generation products with these compounds helping farmers improve yields and providing consumers with an abundance of safe affordable food

4143463 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4143464 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4143465 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4143466 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4143467 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4143468 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
4143469 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
4143470 this year will be remembered as a great one for young adult books
4143471 two big books in one year that continue the fun and fascination with two very different but highly successful book series is a wonderful experience to be able to offer young adults all of the attention and anticipation for these books and the tremendous sense of fun that comes with their release is such a motivator for teens or young adults to spend time reading at borders were thrilled to be a leader in helping to nurture this experience and bring attention to these great books

4143510 after china corn oil and huacheng real estate cnpv is the third chinese company to be listed on alternext and the eighth to be listed on nyse euronexts european markets china represents a major development area for nyse euronext and our ambition is to continue with our strategy of attracting international companies from fast growing countries onto our markets and help them grow further

4143515 they came to me through the company my son works for bike manufacturer ridley they want me for periods of six to eight weeks in iran i have made them a counter offer
4143516 i am received like a king i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the riders there is clear potential in them they can climb well as we saw in the olympic road race when two iranians made it to the finish line

4143518 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4143519 are we expected to believe that the israeli army is no longer able to make the difference between a camera and a rocket
4143520 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4143521 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
4143522 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4143523 the mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force
4143524 we hope that the armys conclusion does not appear to give soldiers free license to fire without being sure of the target greatly hindering the medias ability to cover the conflict
4143525 we are calling for an independent government investigation to review the death of fadel shana
4143526 reveals the occupations policy of evading accountability for crimes against journalists
4143527 because the occupations allegations that the soldiers were unable to determine that shana and his colleague were journalists are wrong
4143528 taken great risks by being in a virtual war zone
4143529 it is utterly unjust and it does not belong in a democratic system where the judiciary should be trustworthy
4143530 shana was only doing his professional job required from all of us journalists it could have been anyone of us all journalists could become a target
4143531 because it gives a green light for the occupation to continue its crimes against journalists and to violate international laws about the freedom of the press

4143594 russia will support every decision by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
4143595 despite the fact of the russian federation presidents decision to withdraw its forces still they are coming and occupying parts of georgia
4143596 as far as we know the military plane are exclusively medicine and aid products
4143597 we expect that russia will respect the humanitarian nature of that mission and that ports sea lanes air routes will all be open for humanitarian purposes another pledge that russia has undertaken to the french
4143598 there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long term humanitarian capabilities
4143599 i am going first to meet with the french president and other members of the french government in france
4143600 and then i will fly on to tbilisi to underscore the strong support of the united states for the georgian people and for their democratically elected government
4143601 the reductions in harmful emissions secured by this settlement are substantial and will have a beneficial impact on air quality in arizona and downwind areas
4143602 srps willingness to settle rather than litigate the various issues in this case allowed the parties to focus their efforts on securing the best results for the environment the justice department will continue our efforts to pursue emission reductions from power plants across the country to achieve the benefits envisioned by the clean air act
4143603 this settlement is a significant victory for air quality in arizona
4143604 i am pleased we are working with the epa in our fight for cleaner air the department of justice has a deep commitment to enforce federal laws that protect the public from harmful emissions the steps srp will take to retrofit the coronado generating station will have a positive effect on our air quality for years to come
4143605 this settlement marks a significant step in controlling harmful nitrogen oxide emissions in the western united states
4143606 the installation of state of the art technology sets an important benchmark for the control of this harmful pollutant epa is committed to ensuring coal fired power plants comply with the clean air act
4143607 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months
4143608 this visit gave us a chance to interact with senior iraqi navy leadership and further enhance coalition cooperation with the iraqi navy and marines
4143609 making a port visit to iraq and interacting with iraqi officers is very important because it builds relationships and promotes positive interaction between our navies
4143610 today was a once in a lifetime opportunity and i am proud to help make a positive difference in iraqs future
4143611 this is an important day for us and for iraq
4143612 having this ship visit umm qasr is a big step and we hope more coalition ships can visit this port as well
4143613 there has been significant progress in iraq during the past year and a half that allowed firebolt to make this port visit to umm qasr
4143614 visits like this are important because they help reinforce the strong ties that already exist between our two navies this visit clearly demonstrates the coalition partnership in maritime security with the iraqi navy and our commitment to the government of iraq and its people
4143615 our forces are here to foster security and cooperation in the region and to conduct operations that contribute to peace and stability
4143616 u s and coalition forces provide the assurance of security and stability that enables the economic development and growing prosperity of the people throughout this region the people of iraq are beginning to enjoy these benefits and our cooperation with the iraqi navy will ensure that they prosper as they expand their participation in the global economy
4143617 the parties to a settlement agreement must honor its terms and conditions
4143618 the justice department and the eeoc will work together to ensure that discrimination in the workplace is met with the appropriate sanctions
4143619 operation home sweet home targets subtle as well as blatant forms of discrimination
4143620 no person should be prevented from living where he or she chooses because of race or color
4143621 federal law prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of ones race and color
4143622 todays case sheds light on still existing illegal rental practices in our community and confirms our resolve to make housing equally available to all
4143623 one of my roles for the brigade was also to be the direct liaison between the brigade combat team leaders and our iraqi provincial leaders our governor the deputy governor and the sheiks
4143624 understanding how to design projects that are effective that are not just band aids
4143625 we tried to work very hard on getting the iraqi municipal and provincial authorities to work together
4143626 because if theyre not working to spend the money and get the services out there the citizenry is left to fend for itself
4143627 so you start by making sure that theyre getting out to seeing their own cities and also communicating the needs
4143628 to watch them interact with one another they are very warm and hospitable
4143629 sometimes all that it takes is getting them all in the same room
4143630 i wouldnt call it magic but it worked very effectively
4143631 the reduction in violence did not just come as a gift
4143632 the soi members keep demanding jobs with the iraqi security forces because that will solve the problem with unemployment
4143633 i think it makes sense to bring sons of iraq into the security forces because its a force for stability
4143634 the employment advantages are obvious but also if you have volunteers that only strengthens the security forces
4143635 from a policy perspective we dont want to see any delay
4143636 iraq is a new enough democracy that they need practice in elections another reason is we had seen the sunnis sit out the 2005 elections so its important that this go around they participate and that all of the people of iraq participate
4143637 my very strong impression not just from this trip but in other visits is that people are dissatisfied with the performance of the local governments and want to address that through the elections
4143638 part of voter turnout will depend on the quality of the candidates if they are attractive candidates with attractive platforms it will lead to a greater voter turnout
4143639 there is so much overlap in finding solutions to problems its no longer as discrete as it once was
4143640 civil military or diplomatic military cooperation is essential and its the wave of the future
4143641 my sense is that the iraqi government is not spending money quickly
4143642 i would think there would be more effort to fund programs
4143643 its always a danger to analyze things in the middle east using america as a context

4143648 top of the world its the best moment of my life wrestling wise
4143649 first of all im very happy for adam as a country of course were very happy we didnt have the olympics anywhere near what we wanted to have but i think there is a big difference between leaving with zero medals and one
4143650 i didnt wrestle in college but i did go to college and i wrestled greco full time while i was in college
4143651 i got in a good program with good coaches and i started winning four years ago i was fourth at the olympic trials and i kind of knew i could be one of the best
4143652 i knew if i could beat him i could beat anyone in the world
4143653 i think my toughest competition is right there in the u s
4143654 weve had better days in our greco program thats for sure
4143655 ive often said you can go from the top of the heap to below real quick
4143656 on any given day if you dont have youre a game youre getting beat thats life is greco roman wrestling
4143657 if these rules were something that started last week id probably have a whole lot to say about it
4143658 ive trained with it its something we know occupational hazard i guess
4143659 mainly we are talking very much about basic needs water and sanitation
4143660 we are hearing today that in tblisi the centers where a lot of displaced people have taken shelter and have been staying are now full so tented camps are being set up by the government in empty spaces out near the airport and other areas so of course in those type of situation and in the public buildings where people are staying water and sanitation will be a big priority in the days to come
4143661 while our team was in gori they visited two hospitals
4143662 im glad to have it under my belt the top 16 guys are going to have our work cut out for ourselves in the morning trying to make the final were all going as fast as we can
4143663 the goal for tomorrow morning is to make it to the final
4143664 if im one of those eight in the final i think ill have as good a shot as anyone the strategy is to try to have as perfect a race as possible
4143665 going into the heats im obviously feeling a bit flat a bit drained over the past couple of days so im just happy to get a decent time

4143667 todays sentencing reaffirms the departments commitment to protecting the worlds ocean resources and insuring a level playing field for corporations that follow the law
4143668 its hard to imagine a clearer violation of the ocean dumping act
4143669 intentionally using the ocean as a garbage can for off spec potash is not only morally wrong its a crime kinder morgan has paid a serious price for not taking care of this properly at the dock
4143670 this was a long and difficult investigation that started here in portland and ended in japan and was solved by the dogged diligence of criminal investigators at the environmental protection agency

4143695 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos

4143701 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4143702 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4143703 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4143704 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4143705 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4143706 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4143707 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4143708 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4143709 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4143710 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4143711 i can indicate to you that position has changed and ill be taking that to the cabinet on monday
4143712 they informed me that there is reason to suspect that a crime may have been committed involving the disclosure of official secrets
4143713 i am not making any judgment about the veracity of the allegations against him but his decision is clearly the most proper response to these circumstances
4143714 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4143715 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4143716 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4143717 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4143718 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4143719 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design

4143734 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4143735 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4143736 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4143737 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4143738 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4143739 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4143740 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4143741 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4143742 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4143743 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4143744 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4143745 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4143746 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4143747 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4143748 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4143749 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4143750 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4143764 should a person who has reduced pakistan to this condition be given safe passage they ask for safe passage after breaking the law and violating the constitution selling out the countrys sovereignty ruining the country and making the people poor
4143765 its kind of a place where guys can relax and socialize
4143766 it would be very awkward if unclothed children are running around the locker room
4143767 i dont think ive talked to anyone in that y male or female whos for this
4143768 no one is going to be inappropriate with a child if another adult is present or likely to be present at any minute
4143769 we want to protect all our members to the best of our abilities

4143774 unfortunately this will be our only gig for the rest of the year and infact for the forseeable future
4143775 we have decided to take a break from doing forward russia for a lot of different reasons the idea of doing another tour with nothing new to offer was something that enthused none of us and the idea of re booting on a productive strand is something were not quite ready to face just yet
4143776 so to reach the present katie is moving to nottingham in a few weeks having taken the opportunity to do an art course there shes in need of a new posse apparently so get in touch if you can help so its unlikely well do anything serious again till were a bit more geographically centralized
4143777 tom will be keeping busy producing some of the hottest young talent in the country hes been doing a lot of work with a band called minaars you can check him out at http www myspace com tomwoodhead and you can get in touch with him at tdwoodhead at gmail com if you want to get in touch with him about producing your next pop record
4143778 from now until october we did talk about releasing a gravity amp heat ep which may or may not now go ahead certainly not in a physical format unfortunately as mentioned it wouldnt have anything new from us but we did ask a few people to do some remixes
4143779 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4143780 a politician is not the best judge of whether or not an animal is in danger by voting to stop new listings of endangered species senator mccain put politics and special interests ahead of science and critical protections for our wildlife and now he wont even comment on the latest effort by the bush administration to gut one of our nations most important environmental laws
4143781 when it comes to protecting wildlife we need to listen to the scientists who have spent their lives studying these animals senator obama has indicated a commitment to making decisions based on science rather than politics not just when it comes to endangered species listings but on many other fronts
4143782 if john mccain is elected well see more of what weve seen under the bush administration including political meddling in science distortion of facts and silencing of wildlife experts
4143783 if these bush administration regulations had been in place twenty years ago we would not have brought the bald eagle back from the brink of extinction senator obama understands that the protection of our wildlife should be left to scientists not politicians
4143784 john mccain wants to have it both ways he says he supports renewable energy but then votes against it he says he supports environmental protection but then votes against enforcing some our nations most important environmental laws he says hell put science before politics but then stands silently by while the bush administration continues its unlawful assault on science and the law its time for john mccain to be honest and give voters some real straight talk about his record on these important issues
4143785 weve all been hearing about chinas problems but that makes it too easy to ignore the fact that we have a serious home grown problem of our own and will all pay a price if we ignore it
4143786 the aging of canadas population combined with the vulnerability of those over 65 due to underlying illnesses such as heart disease probably account for the increasing numbers of deaths during the later decades of the projection
4143787 essentially weve provided a roadmap for policy makers about where we stand in terms of air quality
4143788 and they can choose one of two routes act now to improve air quality or reap the consequences by failing to do so
4143789 with this report were going on record and saying that those consequences will be severe
4143790 talk to most university and dri faculty about their research and it does not take long for them to mention how important graduate students are to their programs
4143791 students are extremely bright hard working and provide incredibly productive insights to the research products on which they work
4143792 we are very proud of both the individual and collective contributions our students have made to science in the lake tahoe basin
4143793 on this anniversary of social security lets reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that social security remains a safety net that seniors can count on today tomorrow and always
4143794 as president i will protect social security for todays seniors and future generations
4143795 its time to reclaim the idea that in this country were all in it together that is americas very promise and social securitys very guarantee and it requires a president who will change the ways of washington protect the peoples interests and bring americans together to meet the great challenges of our time that is exactly the sort of leadership i intend to offer
4143796 violated its fundamental commitment and promise to protect the everglades
4143797 federal judges appointed by both republican and democratic administrations have repeatedly found epa guilty under the highest standard in civil jurisprudence which cannot be explained away as mistakes or misunderstandings
4143798 we want to know specifically who at epa is responsible and why they are still on the public payroll
4143799 unfortunately it is common knowledge in south florida that epa regional managers will do everything possible to accommodate the state and the only way to get them to enforce the clean water act is to sue them which is a very sad commentary
4143800 the bottom line is that the everglades continues to deteriorate according to epa region 4s own recently released everglades assessment report the area of the everglades negatively impacted by discharges from the everglades agricultural area has increased under the current region 4 management
4143801 we will not tolerate employers who put their workers lives at risk by violating key provisions of the heat illness prevention regulations
4143802 all california employers are required to provide a safe and healthful workplace and this company failed to do so
4143803 we are working with the agricultural industry to make sure all their supervisors and employees are properly trained to recognize the symptoms of heat illness and how to respond to it
4143804 at the same time our inspectors are out in the fields working diligently to enforce the training water and shade required in heat illness regulations
4143805 our increased enforcement and outreach efforts demonstrate the commitment we have to ensuring protections for california workers
4143806 in addition the establishment of partnerships with industry and employee organizations allows us to expand our reach to educate more employers and employees than in previous years in this regard california once again leads the way

4143820 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4143821 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the upset a us nba squad 101 95 in the semi finals of the 2006 worlds and in the first meeting since they stayed within 20 16 after the first quarter before the american stars pulled away for good in the second quarter
4143822 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4143823 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4143824 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4143825 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4143826 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4143827 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4143828 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4143829 if we meet them again its going to be harder to beat us
4143830 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit
4143831 ahmedinejads visit has symbolical meaning with this visit iran gives the world the message that it is not possible to isolate iran
4143832 turkeys effort is not to solve the problem but ease the tension and keep the crisis at controllable levels
4143833 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
4143834 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not
4143835 we are just watching the situation there are still snipers out there certain groups have gotten through and the provocations are continuing
4143836 we will settle things with everyone and right now establishing peace is the main issue
4143837 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4143838 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4143855 preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust
4143856 all the sudden these lights come up and rago spotlights me
4143857 i thought you got to be kidding me theyre pulling me over on my lawnmower no way i just could not believe it
4143858 if its used for a mode of transportation they can be charged
4143859 you cant go out there with the motoring public just because of the size of the mower and its not designed for any type of highway travel it travels at such a slow speed
4143860 he did mention the bicycle but i still didnt think my lawnmower was illegal you dont have to register it you dont need insurance on it i wasnt going to endanger anybody going to work
4143861 then again how did they know i was driving my lawnmower back and forth to work unless they were watching me
4143862 if she drove that lawnmower across the field to get from her house to the farm thatd be fine she was clearly told by the judge that shes not to operate motor vehicles on the highway
4143863 tests fortunately revealed there was no fracture to his left ankle
4143864 joe is now back at the training ground where the medical team will continue to assess his situation
4143865 at the moment it looks like he has sustained serious ligament damage which will keep him sidelined for several weeks
4143866 craig comes to us with a glowing reputation it is now up to him to prove to me that is merited
4143867 he has an opportunity to impress me and force his way into my thinking
4143868 i wouldnt say i feel under any pressure as captain because i try to take things in my stride but i do understand the responsibility it involves theres a duty to set the right example
4143869 luke is a quality back rower and has played in the nrl for many years so will be bringing plenty of experience to the team next year
4143870 there is a real buzz hopefully the fans will soon start to get excited
4143871 things didnt work out too well for me with gary mcallister at leeds
4143872 i dont think andy johnson will be able to feature
4143873 he had a thigh strain when he arrived from everton and we dont want to take the risk by playing him too early
4143874 im pretty sure he will be able to play against the arsenal but against hull well have to do without him
4143875 there is a lot of expectancy this year and glenn roeder has brought all his own players in
4143876 but they are a top three championship side no matter who comes down from the premiership and although it is obviously a disappointing start for them theyll soon turn it round and they will be a force to be reckoned with in the championship
4143877 there is no doubt about that with the size of the club and the fan base which is absolutely superb
4143878 i am being made to look as if i broke a promise
4143879 but nobody seems to have any understanding for me when i consider whether or not it would interest me to play in the quarter finals with belgium
4143880 for me it was logical to remain in china but i dont have either the strength or power to fight hsv alone
4143881 this could be a slam dunk for gregor but its not an automatic win
4143882 this has the potential to become the political equivalent of a 50 car pile up
4143883 we move in totally different circles the opportunity to bring our circles together was just way too exciting
4143884 but we werent able to give prospective candidates the attention they deserved in the weeks since the
4143885 well be running more than a full set of parks board candidates a good compliment of city council candidates and were still working on recruiting candidates for school board
4143886 i guess theyll review it and either call me for an interview or approve me outright
4143887 i think the npa has had some really good parks board commissioners in the past i feel comfortable with them
4143888 is the tent going to be large enough to accommodate someone like myself that will be the test for sure there hasnt been anything yet that has shown me otherwise
4143889 theres a momentum in this city a momentum that wants to defeat the npa how that plays out vis vis parties its way too early to say
4143890 were in discussions with vision vancouver and we hope to reach an agreement with them as soon as possible
4143891 i think part of the reason gregor is so popular is that people from cope and vision like him and what he stands for they like him also because he says he wants some kind of common campaign if we were to run our own mayoral campaign that would significantly change the dynamic that is operating right now
4143892 if the left is united this campaign will be a cakewalk for gregor if theres a split in any way peter ladner and the npa will rule the next city council
4143893 neither executive has clarified how many seats are up for grabs
4143894 that could lead to a lot of hard feelings if someone goes in and spends a lot of money and time to win one of these contests and finds out at the last minute that the party is only going to run six candidates they might feel cheated
4143895 if you run fewer than 10 you get a plumping effect
4143896 in a close race the party that plumps or has fewer candidates on the final ballot will come out ahead
4143897 i think some of these people are just viscerally excited by what happened in gregors campaign some of these community activists havent seen a political phenomenon like this for a long time
4143898 others well maybe there are people who might see an opportunity to get on to council
4143899 frankly the nomination race in my opinion will be much more complicated than the elections itself
4143900 that doesnt mean that were a sure thing in the election its just that this nomination contest involves much more complicated politics
4143901 im very upset my dad has just died ive been driving around all night just driving i used a whole tank of petrol driving stopping thinking crying
4143902 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
4143903 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4143904 obama is not a bad person its just that hes like all the rest of them not a reformer not a messiah just like all the rest of them in washington and just like all the other liberals too
4143905 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
4143906 enfatico has had the account for nine months the only ads they have run have been for enfatico
4143907 do you wait until the team is performing before you look at the ground or do you look at the ground before the teams performance
4143908 the reality is you try and take them both forward
4143909 the day has long gone when i could perhaps go down onto the pitch and do anything about it thats up to the lads
4143910 unlike players from teams established in the premier league we had no money no reputation or image to project no flash cars and nobody had their mortgage paid off
4143911 we had everything to prove and nothing to lose none of us had played in the premier league but we had nothing to be scared of it was just 11 different players than we had faced before
4143912 this changed in our second season suddenly we had flash cars images egos and everyone knew who we were and when we didnt freshen things up with new players we were in a dangerous situation
4143913 all too quickly we went from being a side that could lose three games and bounce back immediately by winning three games to a side which could lose eight games in a row and that just killed us
4143914 there was a real lord of the flies split which i had never experienced before
4143915 we didnt feel we were all together and i was partly to blame
4143916 there are kids that were hoping for a couple by now
4143917 we were hoping for the same medals they were it hasnt worked out yet but there are lots of kids on the field of play next week that maybe will make up the difference
4143918 its always frustrating for those watching whether back in canada or here for the games to see us not winning as many medals as they would like in the first week but i played enough football to know that you dont call it a game until the gun goes ending the fourth quarter
4143919 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get at the olympic games
4143920 ich beobachte die entwicklung der fachhochschule seit vielen jahren sie hat sich in der vergleichsweise kurzen spanne ihrer existenz zu einer akademisch hochanerkannten und bei den studierenden sehr beliebten lehr und forschungsinstitution entwickelt da ist bisher gute arbeit geleistet worden ihre qualit t ihre jugendlichkeit und ihre dynamik sind spannende herausforderungen
4143921 die fachhochschule besitzt ein gro es potential sowohl in lehre forschung und beratung das weiter entfaltet werden kann und muss
4143922 herr ihne hat sich bei einer gro en zahl teilweise sehr ausgewiesener und exzellenter bewerber klar als der am besten geeignete f r das anspruchsvolle amt des hochschulpr sidenten erwiesen ich bin mir sicher dass wir mit herrn ihne eine pers nlichkeit f r dieses amt gefunden haben die den sehr erfolgreichen weg der hochschule mit den herausforderungen exzellenz in lehre und forschung weiteres wachstum und intensive regionale vernetzung sowie weiterer ausbau der internationalen zusammenarbeit weiter mit gro em erfolg gehen wird
4143923 herr ihne kann in der nachfolge des gr ndungsrektors fischer auf einer exzellenten basis aufbauen herr fischer das rektorat die verwaltung der senat die fachbereiche und studentenschaft werden ihn sicher hnlich aufnehmen und unterst tzen wie es die gesamte hochschule bei der etablierung des hochschulrats vor einem jahr gemacht hat
4143924 viele unserer studieng nge weisen alleinstellungsmerkmale auf die uns weit ber die grenzen der region hinaus attraktiv machen unser konzept hat gro e beachtung gefunden was sich auch international auswirkt die fachhochschule ist an einigen projekten zum aufbau einer hochschule im ausland nach unserem beispiel beteiligt

4143952 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4143953 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4143954 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4143955 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4143956 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4143957 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design

4143960 so scheint zum beispiel der auf zellen basierende nukle re ersatz der inneren anteile der bandscheibe eine in zukunft realisierbare und minimal invasive behandlung f r r ckenschmerzen die durch degenerierte bandscheiben hervorgerufen werden ohne hochsensible automatisch produzierte gewebekulturen wird ein solcher behandlungsansatz aber ohne erfolg bleiben wir sind sicher dass tecan ber das know how und die infrastruktur verf gt um unsere gemeinsamen ziele zu erreichen unsere partnerschaft war bisher hervorragend und wir sind sicher den automaten bald zur serienreife entwickeln zu k nnen

4143972 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4143973 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4143974 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4143975 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4143976 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4143977 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues

4144001 i thought the internet was ok its kind of like tv ya know but i come home one day and what do i find my son is up to reading books hidden under his pillow and after last summer he went back to school and started off with good grades i just dont know where we went wrong
4144002 i thought when my husband retired he would sit on the porch in a rocking chair like in those commercials drinking lemonade and sharing little jokes with me but noooo hes down at the library every day attending meetings lectures programs coming home with all of these projects and ideas hes reading up on history and politics he knows more people than ever when do i get my husband back
4144003 yes yes some thing else for the kids bah when i was a youngster i was in a gang like any red blooded american now these pansie ass youngsters are in teen reading clubs
4144004 for years now the library has seen a growth in use that i can only call obscene 23 increase in checkouts one year 21 the other last year it was only 18 finally yes its still way more business but least its slowing down all i can say is thank god the parking lots and buildings are so crowded especially in parker and lone tree maybe that will scare some of my family away i mean theres more to life than learning
4144005 if you say yes to libraries this can only continue
4144006 what not to wear for british blokes dismayed not because i have any great desire to squeeze myself into a pair of speedos but because against my will and certainly against my better judgment i have just been forced to buy a pair of the self same slinky togs by the french authorities
4144007 i explained that i had to be there to supervise my boys and still they chucked me out he says blushing at the memory
4144008 well i think they look all right she says with the air of a wife confident in the knowledge that her husband is not likely to be propositioned by any jolibois fancy woman looking like that
4144009 eh monsieur for a moment i hesitate but still i dont look up
4144010 pas de short pas de short bellows the birthing elephant thundering closer jabbing his index finger furiously at my trunks
4144011 i think id better see you later i mouth sheepishly as if id just been caught shoplifting or picking the pocket of the duchess of gloucester
4144012 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
4144013 despite their the parents egregious denial of her danieals existence in life they now seek to profit by her tragic death that they caused
4144014 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment
4144015 this is such a perversion of what parents are supposed to be
4144016 refiners seem to anticipate demand falling a lot more than it really has
4144017 refinery utilization is now so far behind where it was a year ago that even with the dollar as a strong backdrop it was hard to get excited about supply
4144018 i think the numbers that came out today suggest that demand weakness in the u s could continue
4144019 even if u s demand is down were still drawing down because refineries are running so much less crude through their systems

4144024 unlicensed contractors and scam artists should stay away form mariposa county
4144025 if they are caught trying to victimize any of our citizens they will be aggressively prosecuted
4144026 avoid the urge to rush into repairs or rubble removal with the first contractor you meet especially if they just show up without an invitation
4144027 spend just a few minutes checking the contractor out with cslb to make sure they re licensed

4144032 weve previously found that a low risk lifestyle was very important in preventing coronary heart disease and diabetes and now weve also found that these healthy habits can lower your risk of stroke
4144033 a healthy lifestyle is associated with an 80 percent lower risk for ischemic stroke compared to people who have none of these lifestyle factors
4144034 more than half of ischemic strokes might have been prevented if everyone adhered to these healthy lifestyle factors

4144036 why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship
4144037 in a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives and in the united states only congress can declare wars
4144038 oh that is all well and good but voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country

4144154 in qualifying i always go out pushing from the word go as you never know what will happen on track later in the session so
4144155 i think i should be ok in that respect if someone goes down in one of the first sessions that could be it all over for them for qualifying if they havent done a decent lap time and it could happen to any of the top guys i think it should mix it up a bit

4144174 result in late feedback of critical elements much later in the life cycle when the information is actually used by a stakeholder in development or testing
4144175 for a long time the approach was lets just throw some code together because all these new languages like c and java were coming out and they were supposed to make development easier
4144176 enterprises fell victim to the false promises of the web making things easier
4144177 it did but it also made things far more complex you need more system integration use cases and testing
4144178 the model wasnt so much a process as a set of guidelines

4144383 but but you are seeing an ob every month for ultrasounds right
4144384 for example if the patient of a midwife ended up needing a c section the procedure was attributed to the midwife not to the obstetrician who performed the surgery

4144388 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
4144389 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
4144390 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
4144391 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
4144392 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
4144393 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
4144394 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production
4144395 our team continues to be successful in introducing new products expanding our geographic reach and maintaining brand loyalty while driving through price increases
4144396 the fda has reviewed the trial results and the analysis and has validated both

4144426 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
4144427 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
4144428 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
4144429 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the lender
4144430 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4144431 the last text i had from him said one more walk and then i will have done everything i wanted to do
4144432 it was the sort of thing he absolutely loved to do
4144433 we know right up until a minute or so before he died he was probably at his absolute happiest
4144434 we feel that those last two weeks of his life were probably absolutely fantastic and he was really happy
4144435 they explained that he had not turned up at the rendezvous to get the train back
4144436 at that point i knew my son was dead i just knew
4144437 he had fallen from a huge height it looks as if he probably died straight away thats some sort of comfort to us in some way
4144438 our biggest fear was that he was lying there wondering why nobody had come to find him
4144439 we dont feel theres anybody to blame except that perhaps tom made some sort of mistake it was just a dreadful dreadful accident
4144440 he was absolutely outgoing he was always looking for a challenge he achieved everything he wanted to achieve
4144441 tom would do anything for anybody he was one of those people who would talk to anybody he was a really great kid
4144442 he was passionate about green issues and stood for the green party in the local elections in may he ultimately wanted to be an mp for the green party
4144443 he had already booked to go to russia and mongolia next year on a scouts project to help street urchins
4144444 a huge part of toms life was scouting and his life would not have been what it was without the scouts
4144445 were finding it very hard to accept that we will never see him again its going to take a very very long time
4144446 toms close relatives were informed of his disappearance on saturday afternoon they flew to liechtenstein while the search continued tom was found by search teams on monday
4144447 the rest of the hertfordshire expedition members and leadership team have now arrived home in the uk
4144448 our thoughts are with toms family at this sad time
4144449 we are all shocked and distressed by the news of toms death and our thoughts are with his parents family and friends at this dreadful time
4144450 tom was a very bright enthusiastic and committed student who was doing very well in his degree with a passion and flair for fieldwork
4144451 he was due to return for his final undergraduate year next month
4144452 all members of the school of environmental sciences staff and students will be deeply saddened by his tragic death
4144453 there is still work to be done to bring students to grade level as many low income and minority students still lag behind academically
4144454 from 120 feet away he fired a single shot with his 270 caliber rifle he thought he was taking down a black bear instead he struck almli the hiker in the head killing her as she bent over to place something in her backpack
4144455 wonders if its appropriate for hunters and hikers to share the same space about a year before almli was shot a couple hiking on mount higgins heard gunshots while they were on their way down the trail they yelled to alert the shooter the shooter refused to stop and told the m to find another way down

4144459 more than fifteen years ago efforts were made to come to some kind of practical and standard realization of single electron sources of quantized current however it was too difficult to combine the wanted magnitude of current with its accuracy
4144460 using a simple structure that has been overlooked we are revising an old discussion
4144461 but there is not an explicit quantum standard of current
4144462 a standard on quantized current would help us close the metrological triangle current is related to voltage which is related to resistance which is related back to current this is important from a fundamental physics point of view
4144463 we pump electrons for a certain time and count how many are pumped it is a simple structure and there is hope of a larger amount of current from such structure
4144464 developing such a transistor as a metrological device would take some time but there is a basis for trying to improve the accuracy of current quantization
4144465 the point of this particular paper was to see whether in principle this device would be capable of reaching a level of precision sufficient from a metrology point of view
4144466 and in principle this pumped hybrid transistor should be capable
4144467 with a metrological current standard it would allow us to see whether the definitions of electric quantities we have in physics are consistent
4144468 intel and jajah have a common objective to deploy technology building blocks that deliver a richer communication experience for consumers
4144469 the combination of our technologies enables added convenience and energy efficiency for consumers who want the pc to be a genuine two way communication platform for their ip based telephony services

4144472 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4144473 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4144474 humanity faces many problems like those stemming from global climate change for which new technologies may be part of the solution
4144475 human ingenuity can take us far in designing such technologies but evolution by natural selection is an even more powerful designer than human intelligence for this reason we should apply evolutionary computation to our most urgent and intractable problems

4144483 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4144484 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4144485 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4144486 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4144487 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4144488 problem is the specter of relocation has chased several top players to leave nashville and surely has discouraged most free agents from signing
4144489 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4144490 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4144491 why dont we hear more about the kingdom and poverty in church
4144492 need to budget subscribe the budget and use the funds from this limited resource in keeping with the wishes of the congregation
4144493 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4144494 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4144495 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4144496 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4144497 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4144498 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4144499 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4144500 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4144501 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4144502 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4144503 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4144504 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4144505 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4144506 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4144507 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4144508 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4144509 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4144510 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4144511 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4144512 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4144513 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4144514 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4144515 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4144516 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4144517 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4144518 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4144519 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4144520 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4144521 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4144522 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4144523 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4144524 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4144525 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4144526 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4144527 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4144528 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4144529 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4144531 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4144532 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4144533 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4144534 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4144535 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4144536 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4144537 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4144538 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4144539 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4144540 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4144541 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4144542 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4144543 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4144544 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4144545 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4144546 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4144547 the most urgent priority for the u s military at this time is to save lives and alleviate suffering
4144548 we told them that the moa was needed to build the confidence of the milf in the negotiations and that sometimes processes like this require confidentiality
4144549 painful sentiments came out on why the local government leaders were not informed of the moa ad it was our fist time to see a copy of it we were enlightened but still others opposed some provisions like the inclusion of their barangays
4144550 the moa is not the final agreement thats one of the issues clarified
4144551 it will go through an intricate long drawn constitutional process
4144552 in case of any aggression or transgression of the law by the milf they will be defended by the armed forces
4144553 they are going to take one third of the province the eight barangays in the four towns are mostly christian dominated we want out of the agreement
4144554 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up

4144560 the irish referendum on the lisbon treaty has resulted in a decisive no vote however politicians across europe are calling for the ratification of the treaty to go ahead the british government are planning to put the lisbon treaty to its third and final reading in the lords next wednesday 18 june this would complete its ratification in the uk we believe that the prime minister should respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
4144561 the rules of the treaty and the eu are clear all 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force there is no question of ignoring the irish vote or bulldozing irish opinion ireland clearly cannot be bound by changes which it has not ratified equally there is no appetite for a return to years of institutional negotiation the eu as a whole needs to find a way forward for all countries that allows the eu to focus on the big policy issues that confront us

4144585 in darfur and southern sudan conditions remained the same or have worsened over the past year
4144586 this international agreement between the two sides ends any pending issue between tripoli and washington it clears the way for normal and complete relations between libya and the usa
4144587 it was a bad performance we tried to do our best but it wasnt good enough the forwards did not have enough of the ball our man of the match was reina and that says everything
4144588 we will need a big improvement we know we did not play our best game against liege we struggled we couldnt pass anywhere near good enough
4144589 the good thing was a clean sheet and that will give us the edge for the second leg
4144590 we have big games coming up one of those is sunderland we must not play like this again we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game to show who we are and what we are
4144591 as for the champions league fortunately we are still in the tie but we have to show better form than we need to score we have to play better and we will
4144592 you must give credit to liege because they were aggressive competitive and played very well it is different to playing pre season friendlies but we were lucky and the only good thing was that we did not concede a goal
4144593 a soldiers leg helped pay for my tank of gas
4144594 i am close to signing a new deal and its in the hands of my solicitors fingers crossed before saturdays game ill sign a new contract
4144595 alexsandr obviously went back to his club and they are looking for a decent sum of money which at this moment in time is above what we would be looking to pay
4144596 i wont say the door is closed but we wont be doing anything imminent on that one at the moment
4144597 part of where im going is knowing where im coming from
4144598 kent hrbek a beautiful day in medora like always i hear
4144599 a majority of folks are looking for a recycling answer to their garbage either participating in recycling trailer sites where can take cardboard paper or aluminum or looking for something more convenient more trailers or curbside pick up
4144600 people are more educated in last 5 years and what it can do not only for environment but also locally the bismarck landfill is an important resource want to make sure taking care of that resource and making it as efficient as possible
4144601 i think we get a little lazy sometimes its an inconvenience to go to another site and drop off or store for length of time until got enough to drop off if something were to happen on our doorstop it makes it that much easier for people to enter into that recycling option
4144602 el gran conflicto que estamos viviendo entre estos dos a os y medio es esa relaci n del gobierno con las prefecturas estamos en un proceso de ajuste estructural del estado
4144603 la oferta del presidente muestra una cosa muy importante una voluntad pol tica del estado y del gobierno para conciliar con las regiones
4144604 it is a massive club and expectation levels are very high
4144605 weve got wonderful supporters and theyre very hungry for success its up to the players to come in and perform the best they can
4144606 it is only one game and i dont think we should dramatise it too much sometimes it is not easy sometimes new players need time
4144607 its difficult with us having a lot of new players in but theyre working their socks off and it is up to them to learn how to play for aberdeen
4144608 the great thing for a manager is if everyone is on form at the moment everyone is fit which is great
4144609 the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the west coast is surplus refining capacity supply significantly exceeds demand year round this results in very poor refining margins and very poor refinery financial results
4144610 if the u s petroleum industry doesnt reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase in refinery margins
4144611 we believe they need to come out of their partisan corners
4144612 we are going to have to see what the total package is
4144613 what the governor proposed i am not sure can be characterized as a tax increase
4144614 i morgen er det marolles foedselsdag hurra hurra hurra hun sikkert sig en gave faar som hun har oensket sig i aar med deeeeejlig sol og sangria til lol
4144615 we will be taking an immediate emergency appeal to the court of appeals on judge townsends order today releasing the mayor from the tether and allowing him to attend the democratic national convention
4144616 he wants to be here as much as the people
4144617 i certainly appreciate judge townsends comments regarding the presumption of innocence
4144618 i think thats the first time a judge has stood up for him
4144619 du das n chste mal nehmen wir auch den bus
4144620 clients perceptions of how reorientation therapy and self help can promote changes in sexual orientation
4144621 my whole vision of this has always been about creating community and creating a place where we can not only be free but also the kind of community where youre really connected with the people there and feel comfortable and happy in your environment
4144622 club a transgender to death while looking hot doing it
4144623 way too much time on your hands there buddy analyzing pornography great blog though
4144624 of all the bloggers out there you crack me up i spent the entire rest of my work day just enjoying your site
4144625 i just discovered your blog today what a rude awakening that was sincerely a dyed in the wool breeder guy who still thinks your blog is funny
4144626 you seem to like uncut which is fine unless its the kind where the skin hangs way down over the head ewwww
4144627 it is virtually impossible to protect the transit system from dedicated suicide bombers or to eliminate all terrorist threats
4144628 it is permissible for a muslim to kill an apostate a convert from islam
4144629 the russian troops are destroying the city of gori they are mining the city they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4144630 we are trying to agree on the deployment of georgian police into gori
4144631 but there is mutual suspicion there are south ossetian separatists trying to intervene the situation is tense the ceasefire is quite fragile
4144632 since 1971 foster grandparents have made a difference in the life of a child by serving as a mentor or tutor to children and youth with special needs
4144633 they build bridges across generations and help children and adolescents succeed in life and overcome challenges they may face
4144634 the individual inquiries taken by themselves are one thing many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts understandably could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction
4144635 even athletes who are in great physical condition need to take special care when exercising in hot weather
4144636 classic symptoms of heat stroke include confusion or clumsiness and the victims body feels extremely hot when touched in severe heat stroke the victim can go into a coma in less than one hour if the symptoms are ignored the results can be fatal
4144637 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4144638 al qaeda in iraq in some ways is a victim of its own success
4144639 it was so bloody so violent it was so nihilistic in its approach that it was bound to create some kind of counterreaction
4144640 in my judgment al qaeda is at least as dangerous as it was in 2001 because it survived a global counterterrorism offensive by every intelligence service in the world
4144641 and its still standing and its still issuing orders to its followers and its still engaging in terrorism on a global stage
4144642 bin laden in particular has become a symbol of this groups despite everything that has been thrown against it
4144643 the fact that he is still out there almost seven years after september 11th is a powerful rallying cry for this organization
4144644 now the loss of al qaeda in iraq as an effective organization has definitely hurt al qaeda but i dont think its a deadly blow because the al qaeda core is still rebuilding operating with virtual impunity in pakistan
4144645 a number of al qaeda senior leaders went to the pakistani tribal areas and went about embedding themselves in tribal society
4144646 several major plots against the west have been planned in pakistan
4144647 some of these militants are being trained for missions against the west last year there were 29 training camps in pakistan this year its about 100
4144648 it would have outdone september 11th if not in terms of total casualties certainly in terms of total terror
4144649 think of al qaeda as if it was a global business organization
4144650 you have the ceo and the headquarters based in pakistan then you have franchises based around the muslim world
4144651 but they do things on behalf of this whole al qaeda social movement thats kind of linked up by a very simple ideology namely that the west is at war against islam
4144652 the social movement that the old al qaeda has been able to inspire has increased dramatically and that movement is fairly disconnected
4144653 its a self generating group of wannabes who want to do things on behalf of al qaeda but have not been able to link up
4144654 a lot of the interactivity takes place in chat rooms or in forums on the internet
4144655 what you have are really these spontaneous self organizing groups everywhere in the world that are kind of disconnected from al qaeda central but it doesnt matter because they get the message over the internet
4144656 it has to have some sort of central glue it has to have somebody that can connect operatives from morocco to financiers from saudi arabia with ideologues in other countries with other capabilities
4144657 and al qaedas central leadership is the only terrorist organization out there thats shown the capability to be the kind of glue that connects these disparate elements
4144658 al qaeda as it thinks about attacking america wants to be even more spectacular than either september 11th or the failed plot in august of 2006
4144659 theyre not going to do something like shooting up a mall in the united states because they know that wouldnt be seen as of the same magnitude
4144660 if the business community is going to stop this proposal from becoming law it had better get moving because it is going to have to change public opinion
4144661 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal healthcare to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
4144662 this is the way cpusa works they basically try to hitch a ride on the latest left wing vehicle and hope it gets them somewhere it doesnt surprise me in the least
4144663 i think the bigger danger is what this tells us in terms of foreign policy more than anything else because the cpusa has been very consistently opposed to anything that advances american interests
4144664 mr mashai has no right to make such shameful remarks and is not at the position to take such responsibility
4144665 it appears that mr mashai is unaware of the fact that those who he refers to as a people are the ones occupying the homes of millions of palestinians
4144666 these people created the illegitimate zionist regime we do not recognize a country called israel let alone its people
4144667 no nation in the world is our enemy iran today is the friend of the people in the united states and in israel
4144668 the original jews of zionism not those who immigrated there following the zionist invasion
4144669 i said earlier that we have no hostility against the israeli people and that i would have said the same thing again proudly
4144670 the life of the regime there has come to an end
4144671 god called me to dedicate my life to young people to go among them and find them because today it is hard for young people to go to church so it has to be the church to go towards them this project was born to attract young people in the places where they normally hang out such as streets and beaches
4144672 i think it is a very good idea people dont go to church as they did before so it is now the church that goes to the people i think it is very original something new im french and im catholic but ive never seen anything like this in my life
4144673 i may not be able to do the 40th thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4144674 deep in the backcountry the late day sun slants into a hidden ravine and for a scant few moments the cascading stream shines as golden as the precious flakes and nuggets hiding in the rivers sands
4144675 das ist ziemlich lustig weil es unterschiede zwischen den gehirnen gibt
4144676 das eine ist etwas ungest m und sehr aktiv w hrend ein anderes nie das macht was wir wollen
4144677 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
4144678 obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
4144679 many russians in israel also support us they clearly remember the russian regime s behavior during the age of communism and know that this is the same thing he said
4144680 its not by chance that the army is training in the golan so extensively we are seeing a significant strengthening by hizbullah in the past few years were monitoring any possibility of a shift in balance of power due to the syrians supplying hizbullah with advances weapons systems
4144681 were doing what needs to be done preparation wise id rather not elaborate if we need to take action well be ready
4144682 if the ceasefire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4144683 do you have anything to add in the daily report
4144684 i will send the daily report lol i want to go back home jor
4144685 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
4144686 the distance travelled from the place where food is produced to the place where it is eaten considered in terms of the environmental damage that transporting it entails

4144688 a small scale environmentally friendly settlement designed for sustainable living
4144689 the impact of human activity measured in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide it causes to be emitted into the atmosphere
4144690 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered

4144703 s vezes era como estar fazendo teatro com centenas de pessoas em torno da gente nas cenas externas os jornais avisavam onde amos filmar e um monte de gente aparecia
4144704 estive em barcelona v rias vezes em minha vida mas n o tinha um conhecimento muito vasto da cidade quando fui filmar o diretor de arte me levou a todos os lugares
4144705 com a ajuda da equipe local acaba parecendo que a gente conhece barcelona ou londres quando na realidade se est fingindo
4144706 o final desse filme muito pessimista mesmo com uma est tica t o boa porque barcelona bonita tem luz a m sica bela e os atores e atrizes s o lindos
4144707 minha est tua em oviedo um dos maiores mist rios da civiliza o ocidental
4144708 we are delighted richard is a player with international experience and a championship medal
4144709 they teach teachers and other educators how they can legally bring their faith and make it a part of the curriculum and that we dont have to quote unquote hide our light under a bushel

4144734 mensen geven nog wel meer uit maar dat gaat vrijwel geheel op aan energie en eigen bijdragen in de zorg veel extra geld voor leuke dingen is er niet en ook die leuke dingen worden steeds duurder dus de consument is duidelijk in het nauw
4144735 de besteding aan duurzame consumptiegoederen zoals kleding meubelen en fotocameras groeit veel minder dan vorig jaar de consument geeft zelfs minder uit in de horeca en aan voeding
4144736 het goede nieuws is dat er nooit zoveel banen zijn geweest in nederland dat we het beter doen dan de rest van europa maar we hadden het graag wat harder gegroeid dan de afgelopen maanden is gelukt

4144746 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct
4144747 there are no conditions obviously what is missing is that the waiver is void if there is another atomic test
4144748 i think a majority of countries feel that the current draft is very weak and there is no conditionality at all i dont really think that the u s expect that they are able to pass this draft

4144766 retailbeleggers verstijven in neergaande markten ze kunnen niet veel meer doen dan aandelen kopen of putopties en dan maar hopen dat de koers hard naar beneden gaat dat is duur en bovendien expireert de optie na drie maanden waarna je je geld kwijt bent
4144767 particuliere beleggers kunnen niet short gaan zoals professionele partijen voor wie het niet uitmaakt of de beurs op of neer gaat

4144779 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4144780 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4144781 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4144782 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4144783 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4144784 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4144785 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4144786 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4144787 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4144788 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4144795 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4144796 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4144850 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
4144851 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here

4144853 if anything we predate the green movement so you could argue that the greens are actually jumping on our bandwagon back in the early seventies for example naturism was defined as a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by self respect respect for others and for the environment even before then in the 19th century naturists always stressed their eco credentials

4144937 if the supreme court rejects the defense of marriage act as unconstitutional if state legislatures are frustrated by the opinions of jurists in more states than one and if state remedies to such judicial activism fail and finally if a large majority of americans come to perceive that their communities values are being ignored and other standards concerning marriages are being imposed on them against their will and elections and state legislatures can provide no remedy then and only then should we consider quite appropriately amending the constitution of the united states
4144938 dragged down most of all by the anti leadership of the united states the g8 announced a commitment to a 50 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 well a sort of commitment
4144939 it appears intended to paper over the stark divide between bush whose country did not sign the kyoto treaty and european countries that favour strong climate change action environmental groups said
4144940 antonio hill spokesperson for oxfam international said at this rate by 2050 the world will be cooked and the g8 leaders will be long forgotten rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now hill said

4144945 china is not drilling in cubas gulf of mexico waters period
4144946 we give them enough to plant like a half acre enough seeds
4144947 im talking about seeds for their terracing we use leguminous seeds to terrace we use the a frame to mark out how terraces should go and then they plant it we want to stop water long enough to let it drop the soil let plants get taller this soil will get higher and theyll have good soil in three to four years if they do this right they can double their harvest
4144948 we go out in the village and we ask for local volunteers who want to enter the program
4144949 we teach them how to use the a frame we teach them how to space out their seeds then they have to go home and prepare their own land about a half acre then we will come and look at it and if its done then we will give them the seeds to plant they just take a stick and they just punch a hole in the ground they drop one seed of corn in there cover it and then they know how far to step and then they put another hole in the ground they put in two kernels of corn cover it and then all this was planted by hand like that then they go back beside it on the uphill side about four inches from it when its time to fertilize and theyll punch a hole and theyll put three fingers worth of fertilizer in the hole but all of its done by hand every bit of it
4144950 right now the chorti live on tortillas and beans and thats basically it
4144951 and a few fruits were basically trying to expand their diet we give them ten fruit trees of their choice like different type of orange trees lemons whatever they want then if they do well with this program and keep their hedgerows up in between the hedge rows they plant beans corn and a permanent crop like coffee then there will be another double hedgerow on up to the top of the hill on the top of the hill we try to get them to plant the trees
4144952 we know that welfare does not work in the united states
4144953 there is no end to trying to feed people here in honduras with a little education they can feed themselves
4144954 all their soil just washes away and in a few years and they make very little corn and they have very little to eat
4144955 so theyve got to learn to save and protect what they have because theyre not going to get anymore the governments not going to buy anymore land for them
4144956 this tree is self propagating so after a year the wife could go out and cut the tree down have a days worth of firewood and that tree would start growing again
4144957 she would just continually have a supply of firewood around the house and they wouldnt have to go around and cut all the forest down because 95 percent of the people in honduras burn firewood to cook with
4144958 three female goats pregnant at different times i will give them the roof the metal for the roof of the goat house and i will loan them enough money to build a house the goat house is 8 feet by ten feet and its built up off the ground it has a half inch space the floors done in slats or strips and theres a half inch space between each strip and that way the manure falls through every three days they rake this up because its built up off the ground they can use that for fertilizer the goats never touch the ground
4144959 we give them enough seeds that theyll plant a forage area and they carry water and theyll feed em twice a day and when they have a baby the first weaned female comes back to me so i can give it to another family
4144960 remember i gave them three goats then the others i will give them 400 lempiras which is a little over 20 dollars for each good female and that way they can pay back for their goat house we want all males castrated within 30 days and then they can fatten that up to eat it or they can sell it to make
4144961 the children here after they reach the age of two they do not receive anymore milk because the mother weans them at the age of two and then shes going to have another kid

4145009 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4145010 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know

4145019 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4145020 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4145021 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4145022 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4145023 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4145024 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4145025 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4145026 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4145027 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines

4145030 aerial photography gives us important intelligence for managing the response to incidents and investigating incident scenes
4145031 although it is early days of implementation within our command and control operations we feel it will be a great asset in ensuring we can optimise resources and provide a fast and effective response
4145032 it is not always possible to obtain aerial views of an ongoing incident scene

4145040 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia

4145055 to continue without any undue outside influence that this proposed charter initiative may cause
4145056 theres no doubt that inflation numbers are squeezing standard of living
4145057 and thats even more true abroad in the developed world where food becomes a much higher part of peoples consumption basket
4145058 with the economy the way it is a lot of our consumers are now thinking with their wallets
4145059 right now were just watching the market weve got our prices set were always going to be competitive out there if we see that we need to go up well be able to act quickly
4145060 that is the 64 000 question except in these inflation days its the 64 million question
4145061 with the decline in energy prices and assuming that sticks that clearly improves the inflation outlook relative to what i was earlier expecting
4145062 it should lead to some slowing in the future in headline inflation and that should also be to the good from the point of view from inflation expectations
4145063 there remains no evidence sign that wage inflation is responding
4145064 when workers see higher prices now they do not expect a wage hike but rather a drop in their standard of living
4145065 the housing market is still collapsing and you have a huge excess inventory of housing
4145066 until they are worked off house prices are going to decline and the home equity that people have depended on in lieu of income growth is going to disappear so consumers are going to be under fire
4145067 a women who after 22 years of marriage found evidence that the soon to be ex husband had had

4145069 it seems i had violated ebays secondhand clothes policy by offering the tarts her names kylie i have since found out actual knickers up for auction previously i can only now offer a photo of the said knickers and have adjusted the starting price accordingly
4145070 it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
4145071 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith
4145072 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4145073 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the us europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4145074 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4145075 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
4145076 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions that actually require collective action

4145084 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
4145085 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
4145086 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
4145087 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
4145088 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs

4145093 the purchase of pmi in australia and asia is in line with qbes strategy of diversification
4145094 the acquisitions have been structured to allow us to meet or exceed our minimum profit requirements even in the event of extremely adverse economic conditions over the next three years
4145095 accordingly a large number of persons associated with the racing industry including bookmakers trainers jockeys commission agents and racetrack identities have come to the attention of police as having improper associations with known criminals
4145096 i have been told and i accept that a body of intelligence has been obtained throughout the general course of purana investigations which impacts directly upon the integrity of the racing industry in this state
4145097 many of the bookmakers who engaged in betting activity with suspicious persons were motivated by the opportunity to make substantial profits in particular where the betting client was prepared to make extravagant bets yet appeared to have limited betting success
4145098 money laundering is probably the main type of offence we find in the racing industry
4145099 its really important for the industry to be clean and be perceived to be clean
4145100 mr hulls has been asleep at the wheel while the racing industry has been in crisis
4145101 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations

4145103 weve seen no signs of improved consumer sentiment at all
4145104 we see consumers weighed down by interest rates and petrol prices now getting their superannuation information and seeing a destruction in their superannuation portfolio
4145105 clearly theres still not any strength in spending and the sales line is not whats driving the result at this point in time

4145126 i really dont know how a little girl in china might respond to being told your teeth are not good enough but doesnt that happen all the time in hollywood
4145127 the people were so emotionally involved if you asked them whats the most moving episode i think the majority would tell you that moment with the little girl in red clothes now the chinese people feel they are fooled the psychological hurt is enormous
4145128 the little girl is a magnificent singer she doesnt deserve to be hidden

4145135 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4145136 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4145137 live up to the obligations it undertook just 24 hours ago
4145138 so that russia can begin to dig out of the hole that its gotten itself into
4145139 engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4145140 and that is why russia is starting to face international condemnation for what it is doing
4145141 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4145142 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4145143 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4145144 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4145145 will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4145146 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission

4145149 in the preceding days he worked his regularly scheduled shifts without incident
4145150 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4145151 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4145152 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4145153 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4145154 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4145155 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4145156 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4145157 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4145158 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4145159 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4145160 profoundly saddened by the senseless loss of chairman bill gwatney
4145161 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4145162 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4145163 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4145164 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4145165 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4145166 het is van het grootste belang dat we vlug toegang tot zuid osseti krijgen om de hulp daar te verstrekken waar de nood het hoogst is
4145167 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4145168 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4145169 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4145170 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4145171 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4145172 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4145173 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4145174 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4145175 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4145176 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4145177 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4145178 fsa authorisation is a further step towards our goal of developing a fully integrated business model in which we nurture early stage technology create new ventures build great management teams and invest in proven technology iiim is a way of maximising the benefit to imperial innovations of the numerous funding rounds we engage in we intend to continue to build on our relationships with quality venture capital and other private equity investors building strong syndicates for our established portfolio companies
4145179 if this is a world without rules and repression i would really rather have a different one
4145180 i am the kind of person who insert something here
4145181 i enjoy following the laws and adhering to social norms particularly in the following areas no spitting on the sidewalk no midriff shirts underwear underneath ones clothing and not swearing in the presence of children
4145182 i do think people should stop talking about sex so much its much more fun when its a secret besides its naughty to transgress boundaries which increases sexual pleasure how dull to be always accepted
4145183 dad toronto real estate can only go up every year more than 100 000 newcomers flood greater toronto more than 300 000 immigrants come to canada and nearly half of them come here they all need a place to live
4145184 what if i sell my home run fast with my cash and buy a cheaper house elsewhere
4145185 yes indeed son nothing against detroit but where exactly in detroit there are some tough neighbourhoods there
4145186 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
4145187 it about doesnt make sense to put the family out
4145188 once people are gone youre gonna lose the house in this neighborhood
4145189 how am i supposed to pay off my debt if you throw me in jail
4145190 a debt collector may not make any false statements in the collection of a debt
4145191 they cannot threaten arrest or imprisonment if the consumer does not pay the debt
4145192 they will call the person names say youre lazy or a horrible person
4145193 people tell us i do owe the debt but i shouldnt be treated this way and called names
4145194 i barely got the last three digits out of my mouth and she said it was a mistake and its already been taken care of
4145195 we see this kind of problem when debt collection companies buy up old debt from other collection companies
4145196 the farther away you get from the original debt holder it seems the more egregious the complaints are
4145197 there are going to be errors there are going to be times where a consumer is contacted and its not the right person or the right number
4145198 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4145199 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4145200 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4145201 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4145202 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4145203 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4145204 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4145205 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4145206 she ordered them shes a paranoid lady she did it
4145207 what do you mean you cant accept this i bought it here it has your companys name on it
4145208 oh i know the credits are only good for the self service stations
4145209 we dont give refunds on the credits youll need to come back when theres a manager present
4145210 we have more opportunities than we can sensibly respond to
4145211 we have two or three big contracts stuck under our nose 2 3 billion contracts and we are just looking at them and they are looking at us
4145212 suddenly there is all this opportunity and then there is the lack of capacity to respond to it
4145213 people are a key constraint we are recruiting people internationally aggressively using the 457 visa program
4145214 and the workforce in australia has become flexible in a way i never imagined would be possible
4145215 we have people living in hobart and working in the pilbara workers are living 3500km from where they work
4145216 but there are serious issues relating to the tenure on deposits if you have a coal mine you dont get legal right to the coal until you actually mine it
4145217 you can make all this investment and you have no legal right to the deposit you only have legal right when the coal comes out of the ground until the legal issues are resolved i cant see any investment going ahead mongolia is a two to three year outlook
4145218 we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
4145219 we do not recognize a country called israel and so we cannot recognize a nation called israel
4145220 if mr mashai does not have the political awareness that the israeli people are the same people who have occupied the homes of millions of innocent and oppressed palestinians and have created the army of the zionist regime he has no right to hold such a position
4145221 these additional dealerships are exceptionally well suited to represent azure they boast deep roots in the markets they serve together with long standing relationships with customers in the local state and federal government
4145222 moreover as we continue to grow our dealer business we have been seeking an experienced sales executive to support our team and provide strategic counsel and weve found that with ray crews
4145223 appointing stewart morris as non executive director will provide threes a crowd with a wealth of experience within the entertainment and production sector to assist in the growth of the company
4145224 mark watson mitchell has been a great supporter and advocate of threes a crowd and given us a fantastic opportunity by taking us to market he provided important knowledge to the team on the responsibilities and requirements surrounding running a public company
4145225 tara has been fantastic in getting threes a crowd off the ground she opened a lot of doors for us and was a great asset in marketing and promoting the company during the early stages of development we look forward to continued involvement with tara and we appreciate her shareholding support
4145226 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while
4145227 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings

4145242 die agg belastungen sind f r kleinere und mittlere unternehmen gr er insofern ist ein differenzierter ausweis der kosten der besch ftigten in den verschiedenen unternehmen geboten beim diversity management gibt es nachweislich einen gr eneffekt den es hier auch zu ber cksichtigen gilt in meiner untersuchung waren 36 unternehmen mit weniger als 50 mitarbeitern und 188 unternehmen mit 50 249 mitarbeitern vertreten damit werden die aussagen auch durch eine statistisch hinreichende grundgesamtheit kleiner und mittlerer unternehmen gest tzt

4145280 historically mining villages in the north were a hotbed of greyhound tracks most of the working class households had a greyhound and used to race them as a social activity
4145281 now work parties groups of friends hens and stags are increasingly turning to greyhound racing for an evenings entertainment

4145286 as you get so little return is growing in pots and borders actually cost effective
4145287 non hispanic whites who are two thirds of the population today are older dying off faster and producing fewer children than other groups vincent said by 2050 theyll number 203 million in a nation of 439 million
4145288 hispanics are projected to triple by 2050 when theyll be nearly a third 133 million of the population
4145289 the black population is projected to increase by just 1 percentage point from 14 this year to 15 66 million in 2050 at that point hispanics will outnumber blacks by 2 to 1
4145290 the asian population will grow from 5 to 9 of the population 41 million by 2050
4145291 american indians and alaska natives are projected to rise from 1 6 to 2 9 million of the population
4145292 not only will the nation be more racially diverse but more american individuals will be too
4145293 the percentage of bi or multi racial people in the united states is expected to more than double to 3 6 from the 1 7 who identify as such now
4145294 with these projections the american economy may have to make some adjustments
4145295 with the number of people over 65 expected to grow thats going to put more and more pressure on social security were going to have to ask people to work until theyre 70 and well need a more reasonable health care system
4145296 with the large baby boom generation retiring and americans living longer the ratio of workers to social security beneficiaries is falling fast
4145297 fixing the social security program is relatively simple far less complex than reforming health care it requires choosing a combination of revenue increases and benefit reductions but relatively small changes will do the trick emotions run high on which combination is best but the list of options is short and political compromise is clearly within reach
4145298 republicans have to give up diverting existing revenues into private accounts but they can preserve private accounts on top of social security and strengthen incentives for individual retirement savings without going to privatization democrats have to accept future benefit cuts but they need not be drastic and can spare current retirees and lower income beneficiaries the package could include future gradual increases in the retirement age and concentrate benefit cuts on higher income people as part of the compromise both parties must agree to revenue increases but they too can be modest and can spare low income individuals
4145299 the main reason for the accelerating change is significantly higher birthrates among immigrants
4145300 are predicated on current and historical trends which can be thrown awry by several variables including prospective overhauls of immigration policies and sudden increases in refugees
4145301 another factor is the influx of foreigners rising from about 1
4145302 if we dont invest in educating and training african american kids immigrants and latino kids we wont have a middle class well have a very very poor disposable class thats largely black or brown
4145303 we are already in the midst of a nativist conversation when we talk about immigration
4145304 we can certainly imagine stronger and stronger efforts to slow immigration whether legal or undocumented
4145305 the study predicts that the number of americans who say theyre biracial or multiracial will more than triple from 5 million to 16 million people by 2050
4145306 spending could grow even faster under a new federal rule that makes it easier for patients to get the devices by testing for sleep apnea at home rather than in a sleep testing lab
4145307 not everyone with a diagnosis of sleep apnea needs cpap
4145308 weight loss avoiding alcohol and sedatives at bedtime or changing sleep position could eliminate the problem for some
4145309 to be adequately treated you have to make sure patients are adequately diagnosed
4145310 by allowing home testing perhaps medicare is opening the floodgates
4145311 its not only the right thing to do but may ultimately prove to be a cost savings
4145312 neither right nor left but french historical legacies the rise of anti immigrant sentiment and the far right in france
4145313 mccain gop urge congress to cut summer break to talk oil
4145314 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
4145315 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding

4145317 all provincial land taxes collected go directly to ontarios general revenue fund and in effect the money is shared by all the residents of ontario even with the present system it is very difficult to determine whether these funds are actually being used for services in unincorporated areas and with a potential huge increase in taxes it is quite understandable that residents are demanding clarification

4145908 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4145909 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4145910 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4145911 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4145912 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4145921 its very festive and fun even though its a religious holiday

4145926 while samples have been collected and analysed and a vast range of substances have been identified it is still not clear what actually caused this pollution incident
4145927 there is real confusion and lack of transparency when it comes to overdraft charges several banks have tried to simplify this the latest being barclays with its personal reserve
4145928 however i dont think it is making the system any easier for consumers as the personal reserve isnt as clear as barclays make out indeed it has had to set up a video blog just to help explain it to customers
4145929 the truth of the matter is that if overdraft charges were lower banks wouldnt need to resort to confusing reserves and buffer zones to try and make the charges more palatable
4145930 barclays has declared 90 of customers it approached have chosen to accept the offer of a personal reserve however as this was a positive opt out i am not sure if the acceptance rate is as much to do with customer apathy or confusion as much as anything else
4145931 theres a general slowdown underway oil has come down because demand has fallen
4145932 you see at marghazhi bala utsavam we were planning to give titles even to the winners in such junk art but surprisingly we received no nri bids

4145935 mr s amarnath explains traditional air conditioned auditoriums so as to create the ambience similar to what my ancestors had in irans winter 500 years ago if any south indian women dare tell us that it is too hot for south india to wear long sleeves we warn them that they would catch a cold if they come to our programmes we are considering making the traditional burka mandatory too
4145936 these folks invited us for their fancy dress competition but their dress code states
4145937 one of our aims is to create a traditional indian noisy atmosphere that would make the performers on the stage realize that life is no funny matter
4145938 of course the musicians and vocalists who sing at our programmes are using the traditional indian mikes antique amplifiers and loudspeakers of the m gandhi era with the proper nri funding we are going to eradicate all mention of sangeetha ratnakara this text does not mention the necessity for a vocalist to use a electronic shruti box instead it describes too many harmful practices that can help a vocalist develop a strong voice that would undermine the business of our traditional microphone manufacturers
4145939 if you visit a conference you are expected to be in a foriegn dress code you are not allowed inside if you dont follow it why not take this as a small good example follow it if you can

4145957 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

4145987 it is good news and indicates that the monetary policy committee is forward looking it shows that there is scope for a significant reduction in interest rates going forward although this is only likely to happen around april next year
4145988 the sarb made particular mention of the fact that the outlook for inflation remains uncertain complicated by the impending rebasing and reweighting of the consumer price inflation basket for in 2009
4145989 in addition to the uncertainties regarding the values of the targeted newly calculated measure of inflation next year the mortgage interest rate component of cpi will be done away with replaced by the income which can be charged for renting out homes instead of living in them
4145990 by definition cpix inflation would fall away whether cpix inflation would be replaced by cpi inflation as the targeted measure is uncertain it is even possible that total country cpi could be targeted instead of cpi for primary and other urban areas
4145991 the newly calculated inflation values will only be published toward the end of february 2009 after the first mpc meeting of the year and the first opportunity for an interest rate cut is april if the sarb waits for the publication of the data before cutting which we expect it will do however it may then need to play catch up given our forecast magnitude of the fall off in inflation and interest rates cuts of more than 50bp and or between meetings are not unlikely
4145992 there are now indisputable signs of a serious and rapid slowdown in economic and business activity although busa still expects a growth rate of about 3 in 2009
4145993 busa accepts that several of the pressures on the economy such as rising oil and food prices have not been unique to this country nonetheless sa can mitigate these pressures if they are promptly addressed structural steps to boost agricultural production as well as urgent short term social relief measures should be considered and implemented as part of the adjustment process to changing economic conditions

4146116 two detainees suffered minor abrasions as a result of the alleged assaults eight others were confined overnight in a detainee housing unit which was sprayed with riot control agent and then the ventilation secured
4146117 the day that this all took place there had actually been some unrest at the camp there had been some detainee on guard issues which ranged from spitting to throwing bodily functions at some guards
4146118 these alarming findings clearly show that a partially open smoking area is still an unsafe environment where people are exposed to harmful levels of secondhand smoke
4146119 the situation is unacceptable and confirms that the 2007 changes to the law did not go far enough to protect patrons or workers
4146120 nsw should effectively separate smoking areas from working including eating spaces
4146121 the people of jammu have suffered from gross discrimination the problem in j amp k is not hindu vs muslims jammu region vs kashmir region but its nationalists vs separatists

4146123 the response was phenomenal the whole package got sold out within four days in fact we had about 450 room to sell out and it all went out in just four days
4146124 such time in the business is very important for us we get to broaden our systems and the kind of offering we give so first our major focus were 3 4 star hotels and now we have two star ones in the package too

4146173 remember remember always that we came from immigrants and revolutionaries
4146174 for the hundredth time you look fine marvelous in fact besides its only going to be a bunch of old science professors anyway no one will even notice what you have on
4146175 thats easy for you to say cliff men can get away with wearing practically anything besides
4146176 no one care what you wear youre just a crazy old hippie anyway
4146177 its terrible all these artificial lights all the air pollution you can hardly see the stars at all from here
4146178 well were at such a far edge of the galaxy we couldnt get a very good view of anything anyway even without the lights
4146179 professor jones im glad to see you could make it and this must be your wife
4146180 oh yes sorry jo this is professor chesterson the head of the science department here hes the one that helped me get this job
4146181 well a nobel prize winner hardly needs my help to land a professorship i understand the two of you are just back from south america did you see any of the aztec ruins while you were there
4146182 aztec maya inca olmec we saw the whole lot theyre so mysterious arent they you just look up at these great stone pyramids and you have to wonder who built them and what theyre for
4146183 yes yes well i suppose you must barbara my wife shes made a sort of a special study of the aztecs she should be around here somewhere if you bump into her youll have to tell her all about it jones did you read hamiltons last paper on chain terminating methods in plants of the meripilaceae family
4146184 i did and it was absolute rubbish where is he i need to clear up some serious misconceptions he seems to have about the whole grifola genus
4146185 evade the immune response by decreasing local concentrations of the amino acid
4146186 i i was just looking for the loo and i guess i must have taken a wrong turn because i ended up in here and and
4146187 im not a spy or a robber or some sort of weird pervert or anything i just saw the photo from the doorway and i
4146188 well yes that was ages ago that photo though how do you youre not with torchwood are you because weve already talked to them and even if we knew where he was we certainly wouldnt tell you
4146189 torchwhat no i used to be with unit but my job description was only moving test tubes and telling the doctor how brilliant he was thats how i know knew him i used to be his assistant
4146190 yes that sounds about right he always did have a delicate ego im sorry if i startled you what did you say your name was
4146191 well ms jones what do you say to a drink in the kitchen and we can talk this all over
4146192 thatd be super thats what i really was looking for when i got all turned around
4146193 oh im terribly sorry i did used to have punch and all that at when we hosted these things but have you ever seen two drunk scientists try to argue some point of quantum physics its horrible
4146194 so we finally get back to london but we were two whole years off
4146195 im frankly surprised they can build anything at all with just an egg beater and a toilet plunger but anyway so there we are left trying to think of some sort of plausible explanation of where weve been for the past two years i mean we were two school teachers what were we supposed to say that we were undercover spies in the ussr thatd wed run off and joined the hari krishnas
4146196 that would have gone over well we ended up saying that wed gone to help underprivileged students in kenya and after they declared independence we hadnt been able to get and home or get any mail out which was moderately plausible and precisely no one believed everyone was convinced that we had been off having some sort of torrid love affair which let me tell you made the wedding reception a little awkward
4146197 oh theyve all gotten over it maybe it sounds a bit silly after everything we did but i think that was the hardest bit the coming back you leave thinking you know the world and you come back and theyve changed the bus fair and added a new tv station kennedys dead labours in power and the beatles have all grown their hair out for years it felt like i kept making little slip ups
4146198 ive felt like that in the last couple of weeks since i got back you know its like poof everything changed while i wasnt looking but it shouldnt have i was only in brazil
4146199 only in the heart of the largest still largely untamed jungles in world but the better part of five years
4146200 thats the thing about the doctor he colors all your experiences maybe poisons is a better word there was a time in my life when just walking into an old cathedral would give me chills i could look past all the tourists and id feel like id stepped back in time but now i dont know after the real thing i feel a bit nonplussed its not unbearable though and i still love teaching history in fact i think i love it more
4146201 i need to find a job i sort of fell into this whole scientist assistant thing but now that cliff is taking this professorship im flat out of that
4146202 there you are jo ive been looking for you for ages
4146203 have you sorry i was just in here talking to barbara mrs chesterson that is did you win your fight
4146204 that wasnt a fight hamilton and i were just having a highly scientific meeting of minds
4146205 are you kidding this is the best time ive had since we got back to england
4146206 so what about you did you and mrs chesterson have fun with the aztecs
4146207 no not quite the knew the doctor too barbara and mr chesterson
4146208 how many times are you going to ask me that
4146209 i thought after all the discussions weve had about this my feelings were clear are you sure that it isnt you thats getting cold feet
4146210 i just want to be entirely sure that this is something that you want that you arent just doing it for me
4146211 well thats part of it of course it is but i have my own personal curiosities shall we say as i told you before
4146212 usually you two are popping into the hub to visit me i dont recall you ever inviting me to dinner before
4146213 so what brings you to cardiff nothing bad i hope the rift has been quiet lately and ill tell you im enjoying it
4146214 no i just want to get it out there ill feel better if its out there otherwise it will just be a bunch of small talk that im not really listening to
4146215 we never actually settled on the best way to ask you this
4146216 i realize this might just be wishful thinking on my part but i dont suppose youre talking about having sex with me are you
4146217 jack weve reached a point in our relationship where jealousy just doesnt really enter into it anymore
4146218 rose and i have been together for seven years now
4146219 and married for three and weve never been closer there just isnt any reason to feel threatened by anyone else
4146220 but that seemed all wrong impersonal might as well hire one of those sex robots from graffilius iv am i right
4146221 it seemed obvious that it should be you were attracted to you youre attracted to us and we all respect and care for each other most importantly you understand that this isnt going to change the commitment that the doctor and i have does that make sense
4146222 you want to try something new with someone you trust and who understands the score that above all else the two of you are as in love with each other as you always have been
4146223 jack the last thing we want to do is make you feel like were using you we wouldnt ask this if you werent one of our closest friends if we didnt care a great deal for you
4146224 she doesnt seriously think im going to turn you down does she
4146225 in my experience and it is as you might expect extensive as long as everyone knows the score as long as were all clear on the ground rules things wont be awkward
4146226 im just going to savor you asking me that question for a moment
4146227 now that thats squared away can we order some food im starving
4146228 i dont think he spent all that much time in here back then
4146229 let me give you a shoulder rub might help you relax
4146230 i am nervous about this im not going to lie
4146231 perfectly natural rose you know that you can say stop anytime and well stop no questions asked no hard feelings
4146232 i know we talked about that and the doctor said the same thing
4146233 listen jack one of my ground rules um theres one thing i want to keep just for my husband
4146234 i dont know how to say this other than clinically but vaginal intercourse thats just for him
4146235 well first i should know if there are any other areas that are off limits rose told me what she wants to save for you
4146236 anything else i need to know to stay away from
4146237 i think the best way to start is for the two of you to get comfortable with me being here in the room just do whatever you would normally do and ill stay out of your way for a bit then well just see how things go
4146238 i need to not be in the middle for a bit this is great but i need to go a little slower is that ok
4146239 i was attracted to you when we met you know
4146240 was focused on rose of course but couldnt help but notice you no ones ever failed to notice you have they jack
4146241 in at least one of my past incarnations i might have fallen quite distressingly in love with you
4146242 well is anyone entirely one thing or entirely another hardly ever and besides rose is loving this
4146243 and the smell of her arousal for me is the most powerful aphrodisiac in the universe
4146244 he knows how to do things with his tongue that are illegal in several systems
4146245 not ready for you to come yet also i think were neglecting rose
4146246 seems a crime that she has to take care of herself while there are two men here willing to do her bidding
4146247 and you love it when i touch myself in front of you
4146248 you should see my wife when she comes jack shes like a supernova
4146249 i hope you wont be spoiled for just me now
4146250 remember what started the whole conversation that led to us propositioning jack
4146251 this you the last you i always wanted to fuck you
4146252 its different than when i do this to you because oh yes because it stimulates my prostate which is really fuck
4146253 difficult sleeping with someone when you dont actually sleep isnt it
4146254 weve managed to establish a routine over the years when i do sleep its usually after sex other nights i go to bed with her but i get up right after sometimes she goes to bed alone and sometimes i just come in here and watch her sleep more than she knows actually
4146255 it seems like a long time to her seven years but its the blink of an eye really before i know it shell be gone
4146256 its why i want to experience everything with her while i still can take her to every planet to every time give her every pleasure theres just not enough time
4146257 what will you do when she gets too old for the danger and the running
4146258 its why i dont let myself get attached most of the time
4146259 me either but rose it was impossible not to love her
4146260 who knows jack maybe someday ill regenerate and find myself falling in love with you
4146261 if you do im going to play hard to get make you work for it
4146262 and in the meantime anytime you want to do this again you know my number
4146263 just wanted to make sure you still enjoyed just this just me
4146264 i miss you so much sweetheart i would do anything to be with you right now im so upset without you
4146265 ela resolveu se cuidar porque achou que isso a faria se sentir melhor
4146266 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
4146267 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
4146268 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4146269 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4146270 its gonna be okay if you keep working hard your dream will come true i promise
4146271 meinen urlaub verbrachte ich in einem gelobten land das nicht von us amerikanischen und israelischen truppen besetzt ist
4146272 a women who after 22 years of marriage found evidence that the soon to be ex husband had had
4146273 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
4146274 it seems i had violated ebays secondhand clothes policy by offering the tarts her names kylie i have since found out actual knickers up for auction previously i can only now offer a photo of the said knickers and have adjusted the starting price accordingly
4146275 which read better as satire of the conservative urban perspective on the rest of the country rather than an attempt at investigating it since then i havent heard or read anything by him that convinces me that he could even bluff his way out of a parking ticket
4146276 how am i supposed to pay off my debt if you throw me in jail
4146277 a debt collector may not make any false statements in the collection of a debt
4146278 they cannot threaten arrest or imprisonment if the consumer does not pay the debt
4146279 they will call the person names say youre lazy or a horrible person
4146280 people tell us i do owe the debt but i shouldnt be treated this way and called names
4146281 i barely got the last three digits out of my mouth and she said it was a mistake and its already been taken care of
4146282 we see this kind of problem when debt collection companies buy up old debt from other collection companies
4146283 the farther away you get from the original debt holder it seems the more egregious the complaints are
4146284 there are going to be errors there are going to be times where a consumer is contacted and its not the right person or the right number
4146285 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4146286 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4146287 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4146288 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4146289 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4146290 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4146291 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4146292 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4146293 she ordered them shes a paranoid lady she did it
4146294 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
4146295 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4146296 che le donne siano migliori degli uomini non posso dirlo per posso sicuramente dire che non sono peggiori

4146357 but to america s surprise russian president medvedev and premier putin made the correct cautious decision in ending major military activities against georgian and foreign led troops for the most part and brought the massive security option to a halt at least for the moment the russian halt was well advised in order to avoid a stage managed russian atrocity on georgian territory unbelievable to the world replace grozny chechnya with gori georgia sum of all fears 2002 and what happens after there is better intelligence on us georgian plans probably

4146362 it should be clear by brzezinskis comments that georgias invasion of south ossetia was not another incoherent exercise in neocon chest thumping but part of a larger strategy to drag russia into an endless conflict that will sap its resources decrease its prestige on the global stage weaken its grip on regional power strengthen frayed alliances between europe and america and divert attention from a larger campaign in the gulf it is particularly worrisome that brzezinski appears to be involved in the planning brzezinski holbrooke and albright form the imperialist a team these are not the bungling keystone cops neocons like feith and rumsfeld who trip over themselves getting out of bed in the morning these are cold blooded machiavellian imperialists who know how to work the media and the diplomatic channels to conceal their genocidal operations behind a smokescreen of humanitarian mumbo jumbo they know what they are doing and they are good at it theyre not fools they have aligned themselves with the obama camp and are preparing for the next big outbreak of global trouble making this should serve as a sobering wake up call for voters who still think obama represents change we can believe in

4146403 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
4146404 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
4146405 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
4146406 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
4146407 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
4146408 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4146409 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
4146410 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
4146411 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the
4146412 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
4146413 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
4146414 this is rabid anti gm misguidedly demonising gm results in the real issues being sidelined creating the very problems that prince charles is trying to address
4146415 there are several issues that have been muddled together resulting in serious dangers to the future direction of agriculture
4146416 he has confused the dominance of multinational companies and its consequences for food security with the use gm in agriculture if there were a total world ban on gm tomorrow it would have no effect at all on the dominance on big multinational companies
4146417 prince charles like many wealthy people has no concept of the hardships of other parts of the world he wants to retain his vision of a rural idyll by telling the poor to eat organic cake while he pours wine into the fuel tank of his sports car
4146418 he is using the privileged position of a prince of the realm to try to influence us with a one sided irresponsible view of food technology he is like a romantic 19th century poet writing and painting pictures of rural life
4146419 environmentalists have been saying for years all we need to do is redistribute wealth to feed the poor it has not happened so we have to produce more food the most effective way is through gm crops
4146420 i was shocked and saddened to read what prince charles said shocked because it was so ill informed one sided and generally negative
4146421 saddened because the prince is in a position to lead this country in solving some of the massive problems he identifies he could bring together our world class scientists and agricultural experts to catalyse constructive debate and action that would benefit the uk and the rest of the planet
4146422 instead he indulges in diatribes in which he appears to blame the problems of the planet on a single technological advance that he has completely misunderstood
4146423 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
4146424 food security is an important issue we do need to evaluate a range of techniques and technologies which have been proposed for enhancing food crop production and the royal society is currently undertaking a study looking at this
4146425 if we go down this path i think we will put this country at risk there could be a period of great difficulty in the next 10 or 20 years
4146426 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
4146427 prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them out of hand

4146447 in essence the bush administration is proposing an nsg rule change that would not only erode rules based efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons but it would also allow other states to interpret or ignore the india specific nsg guideline as they see fit
4146448 regarding the current us proposal one of the most notable and troublesome features is the weak and very ambiguous language in section 2 which is ostensibly meant to outline what india has done that qualifies it for a special exemption from nsg guidelines
4146449 us acquiescence to indian demands to delete or modify certain sections
4146450 the bush administrations proposed india specific exemption is a nonproliferation disaster that could effectively end the nsg as a meaningful entity
4146451 participation of india in the decisions regarding proposed amendments will facilitate their implementation by india
4146452 to be effective the nsgs guidelines must establish clear and unambiguous terms and conditions for the initiation of nuclear trade and its possible termination with recipient states
4146453 it is clear that the current us proposal to exempt india from nsg guidelines fails to include the hyde act conditions and restrictions

4146478 were asking her to include marketing services policy owner services actuarial underwriting claims settlement and investments as part of other direct costs that are indispensable to produce and deliver insurance products
4146479 we also asked her not to include the p15 dst anymore because its double taxation as well as impose taxes on the investment portion of variable life insurance
4146480 whether the constitutionality and the legality of the agreement is ripe for adjudication
4146481 we were caught by surprise there has been no consultation that we will be included in the proposed bangsamoro homeland

4146494 twice a year 12 chief executives from a variety of organizations from all over the world come to ashridge business school in the uk to reflect on their leadership practice and develop new thinking on the ways in which they work without fail at every workshop the key questions raised are not concerned with strategy profit or shareholder value but are focused on purpose meaning spirit community and the world views that drive leaders behaviors

4146651 we provided all on line editing and color timing for this project in our burbank facility our colorist brian hutchings was able to achieve exactly the look the client wanted in our newest color correction suite
4146652 color correction for encounters at the end of the world was all done in house at alphadogs using the apple final cut studio color package alphadogs installed color along with the optional tangent operator panels which really gives the feel of the da vinci system im used to color worked throughout the sessions without fault and allowed us to achieve the exact look required
4146653 there is a misperception in the industry that bayer interpolation of raw files has to be done through the cpu
4146654 using the cpu is problematic because it overloads one system and the result is poor performance image quality is compromised because you have to use a less demanding algorithm we solve that by distributing the work evenly the cpu handles the loading decoding and playback while the massively parallel gpu does the real time image rendering our approach provides 4k playback rivaling the image quality of offline algorithms
4146655 we get the most out of the gpu by optimizing every individual pixel shader for performance
4146656 files are approximately one third the size of an equivalent rgb file and yet they give you more image to work with because they represent the actual sensor data

4146661 and both sides were open to this and pleased with the outcome
4146662 we had a lot of clean up to do to make these films sound fluid in transitions the original mono tracks were very rough with hard transitions
4146663 there was a massive amount of de humming de clicking as well as time alignment issues we had to deal with
4146664 essentially paramount wanted it to sound as if these films had been released yesterday and with ted halls excellence i feel we came close to achieving that
4146665 originally they had adred all the dialogue but it wasnt exactly on mark so we went back and tried to make it better
4146666 it was a challenge to rethink things yet make it look and sound right and in the end we were able to make everything come together

4146669 it soon became clear that the six point deal not only failed to slow the russian advance but it also allowed russia to claim that it could push deeper into georgia as part of so called additional security measures it was granted in the agreement mr sarkozy according to a senior georgian official who witnessed the negotiations also failed to persuade the russians to agree to any time limit on their military action
4146670 by mid morning european officials were warning of the risks of appeasing russian aggression while georgian officials lamented the wests weak leverage im talking about the impotence and inability of both europe and the united states to be unified and to exert leverage and to comprehend the level of the threat said the senior georgian official who had sat in on the talks between mr sarkozy and georgias president mikheil saakashvili the senior georgian official later made a copy of the deal available to the new york times with what he said were notes marking changes the georgians had asked for but failed to attain
4146671 the decision to send the american military even on a humanitarian mission deepened the united states commitment to georgia and americas allies in the former soviet sphere just as russia has been determined to reassert its control in the area on a day the white house evoked emotional memories of the cold war a senior pentagon official said the relief effort was intended to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want at a minimum american forces in georgia will test russias pledge to allow relief supplies into the country they could also deter further russian attacks though at the risk of a potential military confrontation
4146672 when the main pipeline that carries oil through georgia was completed in 2005 it was hailed as a major success in the united states policy to diversify its energy supply not only did the pipeline transport oil produced in central asia helping move the west away from its dependence on the middle east but it also accomplished another american goal it bypassed russia
4146673 american policy makers hoped that diverting oil around russia would keep the country from reasserting control over central asia and its enormous oil and gas wealth and would provide a safer alternative to moscows control over export routes that it had inherited from soviet days the tug of war with moscow was the latest version of the great game the 19th century contest for dominance in the region
4146674 the muscular rhetoric in the united states followed complaints from georgias president mikheil saakashvili that the administration was not doing enough to help the small country saakashvilis government contributed troops to iraq and earned support from bush for membership in the north atlantic treaty organization a proposal russia strongly opposes
4146675 saakashvili also caused an uproar when he said that bushs pledge of humanitarian aid meant the u s military would take control of georgian ports and airports the pentagon swiftly contradicted his statement and saakashvili did not repeat it during a subsequent television appearance but the administration appeared to be sending mixed signals with its aid shipments pointedly using military planes and ships and warning russia not to block sea air or land transport routes while insisting it had no plans to intervene militarily
4146676 we should work toward the establishment of an independent international peacekeeping force in the separatist regions and stand ready to help our georgian partners put their country back together this will entail reviewing anew our relations with both georgia and russia as the nato secretary general has said georgia remains in line for alliance membership and i hope nato will move ahead with a membership track for both georgia and ukraine
4146677 at the same time we must make clear to russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world the u s has cancelled a planned joint military exercise with russia an important step in this direction the georgian people have suffered before and they suffer today we must help them through this tragedy and they should know that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with them this small democracy far away from our shores is an inspiration to all those who cherish our deepest ideals as i told president saakashvili on the day the cease fire was declared today we are all georgians we mustnt forget it
4146678 this is the 21st century and nations dont invade other nations
4146679 this obama guy is too positive to run this country things are bad danger danger everywhere how dare this guy make americans feel good about our nations place in the world dont forget war can break out anywhere anytime and now is not the time to feel positive about anything
4146680 the partys platform supports the 1973 roe v wade supreme court ruling that made abortion legal and adds a twist saying the party strongly backs a womans decision to carry a pregnancy to term the compromise language is the result of behind the scenes negotiations with abortion rights groups and religious leaders on both sides of the issue the idea is to frame abortion as less of an either or issue by discussing both the need to keep abortion legal and the desire to provide programs for expectant and new mothers it may help democrats woo evangelical christians a core republican constituency that backed president george w bush by a margin of 77 percent in 2004

4146683 even though southern californias air pollution levels have been capped offsets could have a paradoxical effect on the 100 or so residents of vernon and the mostly hispanic and low income residents of surrounding areas vernon whose motto is exclusively industrial was already a pollution magnet its city council welcomed just about any facility that wanted to locate there including a hazardous waste dump and a metal processing plant there are now plans to use pollution offsets to build a 934 megawatt natural gas fired power plant there thats perfectly acceptable within the rules of the offset program but it means a greater concentration of toxic air pollutants in an already hard hit area
4146684 more than half the residents of new york state those who live in the big apple rely on a fabled watershed for their supply of pure fresh water dotted with reservoirs the watershed is so well protected that none of the water needs to be filtered it just cascades through aqueducts gigantic underground tunnels a network of mains and pipes and out of the faucets of the nine million residents in the city that water supply is now in danger of contamination it turns out that a big chunk of something called the marcellus shale formation sits underneath the 2000 square mile watershed and trapped inside the formation is a trillion dollars worth of natural gas farmers who used to lease the mineral rights to their land for a dollar an acre saw the price rise to 200 an acre and then over the last year to 2500 an acre with permits in hand from the state energy companies are drilling the first wells in new york
4146685 we cannot shoot from the hip we cannot act on the basis of ideology and preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a very measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation
4146686 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4146687 during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most its disappointing that the obama campaign has chosen to launch inflammatory and baseless political attacks
4146688 it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after launching attack after attack on barack obama for his strong and appropriate response to the conflict in georgia but its characteristic of the old washington tactics that have failed the american people
4146689 empty words about bipartisanship mean nothing just days after the mccain campaign accused barack obama of being in sync with moscow and not putting his country first senator obama is focused on what the united states and the international community must do to resolve this crisis not on the tired political games that have stood in the way of progress
4146690 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
4146691 an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest
4146692 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
4146693 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them
4146694 the last few days four or five days weve seen one of the most unexpected crises in the world as the russians moved into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning senator mccain and senator obama one had kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
4146695 the other senator mccain was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always wants to be
4146696 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time
4146697 u s knew georgia trouble was coming but couldnt stop it

4146737 that said we have developed a theoretical model for valuing an rcla assuming a number of idealized assumptions these are the same assumptions that are used to price and hedge widely available equity put options as well as generic life annuities which is why we believe the model values provide a rough indication of what an rcla would cost in reality

4146757 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

4146829 two fat notebooks absolutely chocked full front and back both sides of the page
4146830 the music is complete all i have to do is to make adjustments to the content
4146831 i know the difficulties of finding even a modest amount of space in a well run magazine let alone about 750 lines and you no doubt know the impatience of authors there is a momentary spate of publicity about me in england at present and i would like to have taken advantage of it to get a good circulation for whoever presently makes a pamphlet of briggflatts particularly as several publishers seem determined to bring out my collected poems sometime next year which will limit the time available for selling a pamphlet but it is more important to me to appear in poetry which published my villon 35 years ago and nearly everything considerable i have written since i had also better say that i know there are inaccurate and incomplete mss copies floating around it has been more copied by industrious penmen than any poem i ever heard of lord knows why one copying down anothers errors and so on over that i have no control i suppose it is theoretically possible that some pirate might print one of these garbled copies without consulting me but i dont believe it id make one hell of a fuss if it happened but the existence of this curious mss circulation is another reason for hastening the printing as much as possible
4146832 one little notebook two little notebooks completely full both sides of each page with the cuttings out and so forth and i reckon roughly twenty thousand words twenty thousand lines i mean to get my seven hundred
4146833 the poem was written so bunting has wryly suggested to show tom pickard how to write a long poem it was originally 15 000 lines long and was reduced to its final 700 lines over a long period of time the author prepared about twelve copies which he typed out and sent to various friends this version is longer than the final published version
4146834 i use anything as subject mostly ive written a poem that is concrete before ive got a subject i know what shape its going to be i sometimes know even in considerable detail what the rhythm will be before ive got any notion of what is going to be said in it briggflatts began as a diagram on a piece of paper i added a latin motto to remind me of the kind of mood i wanted it developed in that sort of way in fact the first line of the poem is the last apart from the coda it is a matter of filling out the form my forms are much larger the architectonics are the poetry really its finding the actual building materials to suit the architects design not designing the building to suit the materials that happen to be lying around
4146835 you have a poem youre going to have five parts because its got to be an uneven number so that the central one should be the one apex there pointing to diagram but what is new the only new thing that i knew of in in doing it was that instead of having one climax in the other parts you have two in the first two the climax is the less and another immediately comes out of it when youre not expecting it so you have it for those two in the others the first climax is the greater and it trails off if you add to that the coda which came accidentally more or less youve got the diagram of the whole poem
4146836 once i had got the thing clear in my head as a diagram i simply set to work and wrote it writing when i could three lines in the train on the way to work three lines on the way home from work saturday mornings when there was not much to do because theres no stock exchange on saturday morning which would require bunting to be at his newspaper job id get perhaps ten or fifteen lines written and always the cutting out and the buggering about and the buggering about and the rewriting and so on
4146837 theres several ways briggflatts can be explained but its quite simple enough on the face of it if you think that there are four seasons of the year four times of life grouped around another part making five principle parts the other part being the journey of alexander from the medieval legend of alexander when he goes to the end of the world through the most awful horrible things
4146838 very short narrative nine stanzas was needed to set the key for briggflatts for the rest id learned from spenser that theres no need to tell the reader what he can see for himself
4146839 the village consists of little more than four structures dating back to the early seventeenth century the second oldest structure built in 1675 is a quaker meeting house a somewhat more modern house dating from 1725 is where bunting spent his school holidays as a child
4146840 comes from the name of a small hamlet in the pennine mountains in a very beautiful situation in what you call a valley but which we call a dale
4146841 name briggflatts that of a remote hamlet and a quaker meeting house ought to warn people not to look for philosophy
4146842 in silence having swept dust and litter from our minds we can detect the pulse of gods blood in our veins more persuasive than words more demonstrative than a diagram that is what a quaker meeting tries to be and that is why my poem is called briggflatts
4146843 the northumbrian accent was a manufactured one he had in fact a very refined voice but had two things in mind when reading his poetry aloud he was very careful to keep the flat as and a bit likely to roll his rs but he certainly did not in normal speech roll his rs to the prodigious extent that he did when reading his poems i never heard any sort of northumbrian sound like that there was also a slight over emphasis on wanting to bring back the valuable consonants and in particular to make up for the elision of the r in english southern speech i thought he had a point there that we have lost something as indeed modern french has done but the self conscious rolling of his rs i thought slowed up the actual course of the line he is really tracing back his past recovering the accent he was born with with a layer of nostalgia but i repeat there is an over emphasis on regionality because he wished to make a point against southern speech
4146844 you realise that a great deal of what people goggle at in briggflatts is merely an undisciplined and indiscriminate use of cynghanedd cynghanedd is of course all the things that hold poetry together by way of sound various kinds of rhyme real ordinary rhyme we are used to the peculiar rhyme the welsh like when you come to the rhyme word and it doesnt rhyme but the next word rhymes instead or when a rhyme goes in the middle of the next line or the end of the line rhymes with the middle of the line before and they like rhymes that dont have the same vowel only the same consonants each side of it and funny things like that and a tremendous variety of possibilities in the alliteration and so on
4146845 as a romantic poet rather than an eighteenth century poet the music of the poetry has been lost simply because his southern readers cant hear it
4146846 nobody had thought of standard english in wordsworths time he spoke as a northerner in spite of the years spent in cambridge london and somerset in such a northern way that keats and hazlitt found it hard to follow his conversation and though he did not compose in dialect he composed in his own voice aloud his music is lost if his poems are read in southern english and no doubt that is why so many critics imagine he had none
4146847 there are problems bunting is both outside and inside the culture the koin at the same time using what he subverts subverting what he uses but it is not an ironic relationship and his linguistic syntactic and formal stance is not finally satiric it is compositional
4146848 phases of a lifetime in line with the phases of a year without any attempt to bring in historical facts
4146849 peggy greenbank and her whole ambience the rawthey valley the fells of lunedale the viking inheritance all spent save the faint smell of it the ancient quaker life accepted without thought and without suspicion that it might seem eccentric and what happens when one deliberately thrusts love aside as i then did it has its revenge that must be a longish poem
4146850 conversation with basil bunting on the occasion of his 75th birthday
4146851 time and the literary past in the poetry of basil bunting
4146852 perhaps i should write what the chairman told basil the poem is as much about bbs treatment at the hands of those people as it is about their treatment of me equally so which makes it an interesting class blind for those who dont get the joke he was bemoaning his own lot in the guise of a sympathetic ironic but detached observer a clever way to avoid self pity its the same sentiment as the one expressed in 1929 an arles an arles for my hiring o master of singers an arlespenny well sung singer said apollo but in this trade we pay no wages i too was once a millionaire in germany during the inflation when the train steamed into holland i had not enough for a bun the lady asked the poet why do you wear your raincoat in the drawing room he answered not to show my arse sticking out of my trousers his muse left him for a steady man quaeret in trivio vocationem he is cadging for drinks at the streetcorners of course he was writing explicitly about my experiences my dealings with the council dole officials art officials etc but time in that respect hadnt changed for him either and what the chairman told tom is a finer honed version of the 1929 ode and the shame implicit in the later poem isnt that a young poet tom should be so humiliated young poets have enough in growing ego to self sustain the shame is that an old poet basil must cadge for drinks on the street corners and be humiliated by the insolence of arts officials unworthy of wiping the shit off his shoes
4146853 these poems are byproducts of an interrupted and harrassed apprenticeship i thank margaret de silver for bailing me out of fleet street after two years convalescence from an attack of journalism i am beginning to recover my honesty

4146857 here we find for the first time the basic arrangement sonatas odes overdrafts and to a great extent the sequence of poems which was to be worked on and added to over the next 35 years
4146858 perhaps he means mr eliot but no one recalls now and then that eliot was american is british only now by virtue of documents of citizenship an affiliation with anglo catholicism and a rapport with an assortment of notables persons of peerage etcetera
4146859 felt that as simpson had taken the trouble to compile and edit the book the preface should remain
4146860 to record my gratitude to dallam flynn for the edition he undertook in a more difficult time than this
4146861 this is the only signed limited edition 26 copies numbered a z thomas pickard
4146862 limited to 175 numbered copies and 26 copies lettered a z and signed by the author
4146863 the colophon is misleading it implied one hundred and seventy five copies of the ordinary edition whereas these copies are divided between 125 in the ordinary edition and 50 in the special edition
4146864 the edition of my poems which dallam flynn printed in texas in 1950 is all sold and stuart montgomery thinks there are still people curious to read them who cannot find a copy
4146865 continual debt to the two greatest poets of our age ezra pound and louis zukofsky
4146866 none of these poems have previously appeared in a book by the author
4146867 i have taken my chance to add two or three and take one away to read the proofs more carefully than i could when i was in teheran and my publisher in texas to insert a couplet in the odes and promote the orotava road from limbo to its chronological place amongst them which has obliged me to renumber many and to give the book a title to replace the off hand label by which it has been known or unknown for fifteen years
4146868 a man who collects his poems screws together the boards of his coffin those outside will have all the fun but he is entitled to his last confession these verses were written here and there now and then over forty years and four continents heaped together they make a book
4146869 if i ever learned the trick of it it was mostly from poets long dead whose names are obvious wordsworth and dante horace wyat and malherbe manuchehri and ferdosi villon whitman edmund spenser but two living men also taught me much ezra pound and in his sterner stonier way louis zukofsky it would not be fitting to collect my poems without mentioning them with sleights learned from others and an ear open to melodic analogies i have set down words as a musician pricks his score not to be read in silence but to trace in the air a pattern of sound that may sometimes i hope be pleasing unabashed boys and girls may enjoy them this book is theirs
4146870 whose editors have been kind to me one after another
4146871 limited to three hundred numbered copies of which two hundred and fifty are for sale
4146872 guido londinensis former master of the latin press at the dynastic officina mauritiana at present established in holborn london
4146873 a new edition of this book has given me a chance to put right a few words and stops the compositor got wrong and to add four short new poems a fifth seemed better lost
4146874 gummed 4 new ones at the proper place one of them had to be folded in because there was no convenient place to gum it
4146875 literals etc occur on pages 21 26 31 44 61 71 83 96 110 140 and in the table of contents
4146876 a total of 11 lines needing resetting is not i think much if you decide to use offset plus the 4 new poems all short which will of course entail changes in the table of contents and the supplementary preface and consider whether the new poems require new notes probably not
4146877 there is one solitary short poem that i have added to the collected volume
4146878 jennifer moyer and britt bell the publishers spent an afternoon with bb at whitley chapel only ten days before his death and they have heeded his wishes just the one extra poem
4146879 intended this fable to be published as an illustrated book for children
4146880 when we went out this morning you were about to tell me a story
4146881 anyway you said something about your cousin getting out of jail
4146882 when we were kids he used to love to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches hed eat that bullshit all day if he could my aunt would beat him though that was her answer for everything the belt after while she got my mother punishing me too
4146883 i dont fucking know cause jellyd get sick i was the oldest so i had to pay for it i guess plus
4146884 we just thought he looked like a jar of jelly like grape jelly
4146885 see my mother did well enough for me to go to private school but jelly and them were poor i used to get sick from what they ate on a regular basis true story you know beef thats almost green and canned corn and peas and shit not much else serious the times when they had something was because jellys father had some money hed come over sometimes montgomery he had a big mustache used to push this old benz one of those they dont even make any more
4146886 he wasnt rich by a long shot but gloria wanted him to be she wished he fucking was even i could see that all day shed wait on him doing nothing so he could chauffeur them downtown once in a blue moon like dignitaries go to red lobster olive garden thats where jelly got his big ideas from her always wanting all this money always talking about it jewelry and all that all day she sit with those rollers in her hair i remember with her bra busting open and a cigarette smoking in her fingers
4146887 she just watched soaps all day guiding light general hospital all that crap
4146888 like she was wooing herself in a way summertime i saw it all everything her walking around that little ass crib like a goddess undressed like she was the black goddess of summer think im playing she should have a star on the fucking hollywood walk of fame im telling you
4146889 i swear plus montgomeryd always come pulling me aside and try to be poetic and wise like he was my father and shit mucho trabajo poco dinero osean lot of work little money i always remember him saying that we all got the short stick might as well make the best of it fuck it by we he meant us but i always thought it was more general a general rule of thumb
4146890 then years later i find out the nigga had another family the whole time wife and kids in long island matter fact he was married already when my aunt met him
4146891 jelly falls in with this bunch of thugs niggas from the hood with nothing to do you know these niggas its nothing at first but soon theyre robbing bodegas for little candy cigarettes and soda little bullshit one cat had a thing for porno niggas start lifting tvs camcorders dvds whatever long as they made some money it didnt matter niggas had names like peru heroin and taj mahal like thats what they actually called themselves i mean my mom named me osean but thats different
4146892 i got a grandfather somewhere thats part irish the thing was niggas started fighting themselves amongst the group of them egos it wasnt but a few weeks ago somebody told me this dude pat that still lives in the hood he told me two of these niggas got murked in they car one night they old running buddy cochise set it up apparently a old deal gone wrong
4146893 its another kind of life its no rules no morals no nothing crazy thing is its funny i used to idolize jelly and i was the older one he was the suave one good with the girls all that stuff that matters
4146894 i still cant tell what the fuck happened its like he never had any other choice someplace to go
4146895 he didnt want to have nowhere to go you ask me thats what it was i sorta feel bad for him but
4146896 you might be right though he never had all the chances youve had
4146897 sad part is jelly got caught stealing stereos and shit from this spot up on fordham road by then hes got his girl six months pregnant i can never remember her damn name richelle raquel something like that richelle brown and jelly got sent up north rikers the sad thing is he was changing he even started reading stuff like stephen king
4146898 he got sentenced six to eight years pleaded that shit down from like fifteen since he was unarmed hes just in the car the getaway guy the fucking driver you believe that shit
4146899 you just waste something so precious because because you you just dont have the drive something the willpower dont you think thats so selfish i know hes your family and everything but jesus
4146900 i dont want to just wander through life for nothing osean
4146901 so my aunt gloria who to this day will defend jelly as the victim
4146902 shes raising the kid with this girl richelle or whatever the mom and the baby mama
4146903 so thats it they back together just like that all happy ever after
4146904 same old crew all over again some of the guys were back on streets already new ones too theres always new ones but jelly he wants to walk the straight and narrow right hes reading the art of war and henry miller tropic of cancer his cellmate turned him onto this stuff some guy used to teach high school he read all these books on acupuncture hells yes acupuncture
4146905 but the whole acupuncture thing jelly said himself he liked it because of the needles
4146906 he finally could pinpoint his problems little personal things he called it black damage like black ice the damage you cant see
4146907 he never knew how to get to it before course he hadnt done shit mind you but just thinking about it its like hes putting chaos back in the right order all the broken pieces back in place you can numb the body and bring it back to life you dont remember
4146908 i brought up doing it myself when we went at it about the baby
4146909 in a sense yeah it turned out she was loyal til the end then she disappeared bitch just left all of a sudden one day went to stay with some family she had out in brooklyn in bed stuy jelly was heartbroken more than anything he wanted her back and the baby too of course especially his son
4146910 he was a fucking mess what he didnt know but quickly found out was shed been seeing this old ex of hers truth is she tells jelly the honest truth is she never stopped loving the guy shes like its not over between them
4146911 here hes still thinking he loved her but he knew it wasnt true
4146912 shes crying telling him she doesnt love him like it hurts her too
4146913 same story all over again he got caught out there this was the second strike but he just got home yesterday so now theres this little party
4146914 watch the spade watch the ace of spades where it go is it gone
4146915 maybe i dont know my aunt says he want to join the marines change his life up but we both know that wont work cant just switch it up all of a sudden
4146916 if he goes back its like its three strikes thats it game over
4146917 and dont lie cause you know i could read your mind
4146918 the opportunity for gooding and company to auction these its the moments you dream of
4146919 no doubt it is fitting that maggots consume us in the end or at least the rubbish we scatter as we go but id rather leave the lid on my dustbin and the earth on my friends graves piety takes curious forms the toenail clippings of saint whats his name are revered i dont think religion is much advanced by that it would be more profitable more to his glory to throw away some of the poems pound printed than to print those he threw away himself i apologise for my lack of sympathy for the industrious compilers

4146927 there should be restrictions on what wilders can say it is a very bad example to people to let him say whatever he wants
4146928 it strikes me that holland is a test case for how we in europe deal with religious and ethnic bigotry we can take the american approach and accept it whilst letting it fester and increase or try to legislate and deal with it
4146929 as stupid as i believe religion to be id still rather live in a country where people protest against forms of media that spread hatred and purposely incite offence anger outrage
4146930 you dont see why its outrageous because you dont know much about jewish history anti semitism crops up where jews are a large and prominent presence e g spain poland the ukraine or classical alexandria and so forth your assertion indicates you dont see this pattern because you dont know it
4146931 of course they do theyre the tail of the distribution if muslim communities in britain where totally quiescent there wouldnt be a danger of political radicalism similarly very few irish britons were involved with the ira but the terrorism from this segment was a reflection of broader dynamics of alienation and feelings of embitterment
4146932 if you want to get specific you need to break down the
4146933 youd think that people who live among the immigrants would be less prejudiced
4146934 is the support for immigration among the native population higher in regions with a larger immigrant population or not even if they havent done surveys you can look at the level of support for anti immigration parties is their support the highest in areas without a large immigrant population or not over here its consistently the opposite the more interaction people have with third world immigrants the more they oppose further immigration everyone knows the far right gets the votes in those neighbourhoods that have third world immigrants
4146935 youd think that people who live among the immigrants would be less prejudiced
4146936 besides what are we going to do about immigrants and refugees who refuse to interact with the rest of society
4146937 to paraphrase voltaire i do not agree with what he has to say but ill defend to the death his right to say it

4146954 these alarming findings clearly show that a partially open smoking area is still an unsafe environment where people are exposed to harmful levels of secondhand smoke

4147003 apart from long distance calls telkom has never decreased its prices
4147004 the only reason long distance prices were unchanged this year was that its in competition with every voip voice over internet protocol call back and cellular service out there
4147005 telkom needs to be careful they need to nurture customers so that when real competition enters the market it will be able to hold on to them
4147006 in our understanding there isnt any competition in the sector thats why telkom has been providing a poor service these price increases are not good for small business development especially when you compare them with prices overseas where they are very cheap

4147020 joe takes pressure off me because hes the one who gets the innings going
4147021 for me especially young guys when they come into your side you want to see if theyve got a technique and can hit the ball well in one day cricket
4147022 joe as well as anchoring an innings can take advantage of the power plays and i dont see him hiding in the big games
4147023 in the semi final he hit his first century of this competition 102 v durham and this was a televised game with steve harmison bowling as fast as he did in the test match
4147024 as a young guy it can be a bit daunting opening the innings but you just see the bloke looking like hes enjoying it and its the big occasion where he seems to come good
4147025 over the last two years he has got hundreds in the four day game and good runs in the one day game
4147026 in england we are always looking for a adam gilchrist or a sanath jayasuriya
4147027 what the selectors have got wrong is they end up picking a technically correct batsman who cant take advantage of power plays or someone who can but hasnt got much technique
4147028 joe is someone who can hit a good length ball on the up through the covers he plays the short ball pretty well but also gets stuck in where its needed
4147029 thats what england have missed in the past few years
4147030 all i know is that wicketkeepers should catch and no excuses
4147031 fozzie as a gloveman looks very very good up to the stumps when people like seamer david masters are bowling it helps them because he puts you under pressure as a batman
4147032 the middle order is one of the toughest places to bat in 50 over cricket
4147033 fozzie seems to do it pretty well gets the scoreboard going straight away and hits the ball in strange places and hits a few long balls as well like joe and ravi whatever the situation they try to win the game
4147034 i had a fantastic time for the twenty20 period and ive been able to follow it up with the games after that so its been a good summer
4147035 over the years ive always been able to play cameo innings of 40 or 50 in a short space of time
4147036 as a junior schoolboy i was able to hit a few hundreds along the way then essex gave me the chance to go up the order and that one game came off for me against sussex and gave me confidence to keep on playing in that style and fingers crossed beat keysies side at the weekend
4147037 its difficult to explain how or why what went right that day it was like the ball was in slow motion and the bat twice as big i felt twice as strong
4147038 i was pushed up to bat at three after getting a 37 against middlesex after batting at eight
4147039 they said to me you look like youre in form give it a go and from that innings i built on a good base foundation the first few runs came a bit scratchily and theres a point when you start to go for it

4147042 so far yacyret has not lived up to even 10 percent of what was promised
4147043 no one was even warned when the water level was raised
4147044 what we are especially worried about is the pollution because many latrine pits are now underwater they promised to relocate us but we dont know where or when and we have to keep working
4147045 we dont agree with raising the water level before the problems have been solved and before the whole area has been cleared out properly and the necessary environmental treatment completed
4147046 but apparently the decision was a unilateral one taken by the argentine side of the binational body
4147047 the campaign will continue until the waters go down again because the damages already caused are enormous especially for businesses located in the flooded lower part of the city
4147048 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important
4147049 do you recall the precise details of the sudeten crisis that led to nazi germanys invasion of czechoslovakia

4147052 president sarkozy has landed in paris holding in his hand a piece of paper guaranteeing peace in our time
4147053 we are faced with a resurgent major power with imperialist megalomaniacal ambitions led by the most effective leader in the world today
4147054 ladies and gentlemen i find this terribly reminiscent of the 1930s
4147055 when a column begins like this the author has got to be a neoconservative pushing for the next war
4147056 disregard the hysterical diatribes of georgian president mikheil saakashvilis american champions who protest too much perhaps because their irresponsible encouragement of the georgian president was a contributing factor on the road to the war

4147062 software drives the business and business analysts are the key conduit in delivering satisfaction to the line of business by effectively defining requirements to the it organization
4147063 the business analyst is critical to the overall success an organization will experience with its applications
4147064 it is critical to the alignment of the line of business and it as well as customer satisfaction to eliminate time consuming and error prone tasks such as the manual creation of test cases from requirements
4147065 dynamic creation of test cases from requirements frees up the time of the test engineer to focus on more strategic quality efforts incorporating modern and dynamic solutions for the business analyst will complement and enhance existing investments in testing solutions
4147066 the business analyst has been dramatically underserved for far too long
4147067 as their role grows in importance we have seen a significant increase in demand for solutions that help them closely align requirements with the business need our customers are seeing dramatic improvements in their development process by leveraging requirements solutions to enable the business analyst to succeed
4147068 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4147069 in fact there are more tornadoes per square mile in britain than in the usa but thankfully they are not as destructive
4147070 on average we can expect 33 every year but in 1982 there were 152
4147071 i kept following it for a few minutes but it dissipated before it touched the ground
4147072 it was a long way off so i was never really worried that it would do any damage
4147073 i noticed that the cloud formation was really odd and when i looked away and looked back only then i realized that it was a twister he said
4147074 my partner was in a panic trying to locate the camera and whether there was any charge in it
4147075 theres really nothing better than that feeling of being the one who created this wish for them
4147076 im so excited to see her reaction from when i walk in
4147077 shes hopefully extremely excited and more excited than i am to meet her because i know shes done a great thing
4147078 ive never taken it all that seriously to begin with
4147079 i think of it as kind of an athlete you get a super bowl ring its great the seasons over now try to do it over again and it doesnt happen
4147080 i thought a couple things i thought this could be a really bad idea and as i read more i thought it was an opportunity to kind of to do something to show that weve progressed to a point where what used to be so hurtful and offensive could now be used in a self deprecating way
4147081 i also thought how come ben stiller calls me and asks me to be in a big comedy movie but makes the risk level this high
4147082 marilah kamu tunduk kepada hukum yang allah telah turunkan dan kepada hukum rasul
4147083 ya tuhan kami mengapa engkau wajibkan berperang kepada kami mengapa tidak engkau tangguhkan kewajiban berperang kepada kami beberapa waktu lagi
4147084 kesenangan di dunia ini hanya sebentar dan akhirat itu lebih baik untuk orang orang yang bertakwa dan kamu tidak akan dianiaya sedikit pun
4147085 barang siapa yang tawakal kepada allah maka sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
4147086 ia mempercayai semua yang baik bagi kamu ia beriman kepada allah mempercayai orang orang mukmin dan menjadi rahmat bagi orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu
4147087 siapakah di antara kamu yang bertambah imannya dengan turunnya surat ini
4147088 allah dan rasul nya tidak menjanjikan kepada kami melainkan tipu daya
4147089 siapakah yang dapat melindungi kamu dari takdir allah jika dia menghendaki bencana atasmu atau menghendaki rahmat untuk dirimu
4147090 benar tetapi kamu mencelakakan dirimu sendiri dan menunggu kehancuran kami dan kamu ragu ragu serta ditipu oleh angan angan kosong sehingga datanglah ketetapan allah dan kamu telah ditipu terhadap allah oleh syaitan yang amat penipu
4147091 sesungguhnya jika kamu diusir niscaya kami pun akan keluar bersama kamu dan kami selama lamanya tidak akan patuh kepada siapa pun untuk menyusahkan kamu dan jika kamu diperangi pasti kami akan membantu kamu
4147092 sesungguhnya aku berlepas diri dari kamu karena sesungguhnya aku takut kepada allah tuhan semesta alam

4147095 on behalf of mr alston he wishes to apologize to the rockets and the fans
4147096 he never intended for this to happen he is looking forward to putting this behind him
4147097 the criteria for mortgages may still be strict but its nonetheless encouraging to see mortgage rates coming down like this
4147098 essentially any move in this direction bodes well for the housing market implying a return of confidence among lenders which should translate into greater confidence among would be homeowners
4147099 with lenders determined to protect themselves against potential falls in house prices the biggest drops are aimed at those with the largest deposits
4147100 at the moment of course prices are dropping because of the problems in the mortgages market theyre dropping because so many people simply cant buy once mortgages become cheaper and more readily available theres a high probability that prices will level out or increase nevertheless astute would be homebuyers are fully aware that any increase in prices cant take place overnight and theyre saving up now to make sure they can move as soon as mortgage rates descend to a level they find acceptable but before house prices start to climb once more
4147101 any homeowner thinking of selling their property today faces an unpleasant choice sell now if they can for an average of 9 less than their property would have fetched at the peak of the housing market in october 2007 or wait and hope the market improves
4147102 at the same time the rising cost of mortgages has hit anyone looking to remortgage because theyre coming off their existing fixed rate mortgage for example or consolidating their debts this news about falling mortgage rates may be particularly significant for people in this group as so many of them find themselves forced to act within a certain timeframe for them wait and see simply isnt an option
4147103 even in the market were targeting theres still a lot of entertainment going on
4147104 i think it allows for that like in the kitchen area people do gather there quite often and enjoy that living space
4147105 the prospects i have coming in here are looking for a new lifestyle entertaining interacting and having a social gathering with their neighbors
4147106 this will give people the opportunity to take it all in and see what an exciting community its going to be
4147107 i served with mccain and we were the only two republicans to vote against the bush tax cuts
4147108 he says now he would make them permanent its a different john mccain
4147109 until i voted for sen obama i had never voted for a democrat so i think my republican credentials are sincere
4147110 but the change that he so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure
4147111 barack obama believes you cant have a strong economy when you have a weak middle class and speakers like senator bob casey jr of pennsylvania and governor deval patrick of massachusetts will share how obamas policies have been directly shaped by the people he has met as he traveled the country
4147112 its not that big a stretch for barack obama to win north carolina this year
4147113 this is a battleground and were going to win it
4147114 i think the 11th congressional district is winnable by sen obama
4147115 as a liquid fuel reactor the msr has two sets of unique characteristics relative to solid fuel reactors safety under emergency conditions the liquid fuel is drained to passively cooled critically safe dump tanks by the use of freeze valves cooled sections of piping and other techniques this safety system can be passively initiated upon overheating of the coolant salt msrs operate at steady state conditions with no change in the nuclear reactivity of the fuel as a function of time last the option exists to remove fission products online and then solidify those radionuclides into a stable waste form this minimizes the radioactive inventory accident source term in the reactor core and potential accident consequences fuel cycles the liquid fuel allows online refueling and a wide choice of fuel cycle options burning of actinides from other reactors a once through fuel cycle a thorium 233u breeder cycle and a denatured thorium 233u breeder cycle some of the options such as a thermal neutron spectrum thorium 233u breeder cycle require online refueling and thus can not be practically achieved using solid fuels the use of a liquid fuel also avoids the need to develop fuel or fabricate fuel
4147116 changing from a steam cycle to a gas brayton cycle eliminates this class of challenges
4147117 in the last decade compact plate fin and printed circuit high temperature heat exchangers have been developed for the aircraft chemical and offshore oil industries the adoption of compact heat exchangers drastically reduces the molten fuel salt inventory in the heat exchangers and may reduce the inventory of fuel salt in the reactor by up to 50 there are major benefits in using such heat exchangers products used in industry these heat exchangers are being considered for use in high temperature helium cooled reactors and in the transport of heat from high temperature gas cooled reactors to hydrogen production plants using liquid fluoride salt heat transport systems additional work is required to fully evaluate their use in msr s
4147118 in an msr volatile fission products including xenon are removed continuously which creates a large parasitic neutron sink in solid fuel reactors
4147119 the size of the heat exchangers is reduced by a factor of 3 or more
4147120 the aircraft and other industries have developed compact heat exchangers with buffer gas zones to separate different fluids that may react explosively such as hot gases vaporizing fuels in aircraft the same technologies enable trapping of tritium from the primary system in the heat exchanger
4147121 carbon carbon composites are potentially an enabling technology for very high temperature msrs however there are major technical uncertainties including joining technologies
4147122 pound for pound carbon nanotubes are stronger and lighter than steel
4147123 the shape and direction of this imperfection does not change and it never gets any larger
4147124 we were amazed by it but upon further study we found a good explanation

4147212 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4147213 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4147214 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4147215 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4147216 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4147217 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4147218 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4147219 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep

4147229 bedrijven zijn op zoek naar mensen die binnen het team passen eigenlijk zijn ze dus op zoek naar mensen die er net zo uitzien als zijzelf
4147230 een tip kijk op de website van het bedrijf waar je solliciteert daarop staan mensen afgebeeld die de sfeer van het bedrijf weergeven probeer je net zo te kleden
4147231 in creatieve sectoren zoals de reclame en architectuur kun je veel uitbundiger je eigen stijl volgen dan in de meer traditionele zakelijke dienstverlening
4147232 je kleding moet neutraliseren zodat de sollicitatiecommissie of je collegas niet afgeleid raken door de verpakking maar letten op de inhoud de persoon en zijn kwaliteiten
4147233 als je solliciteert op een zakelijke functie zul je je een beetje conservatief misschien zelfs saai moeten kleden denk aan donkerblauwe of grijze pakken er zijn allerlei theori n over een wit hemd omdat dat steriel en kleurloos zou zijn dus trek maar een lichtblauw overhemd aan ik zou kiezen voor een stropdas hoewel die op dit moment niet in de mode is

4147327 dire fiscal condition combined with the legislatures failure to enact an on time budget raises the very real immediate prospect that the receivers construction program will fail for lack of a clear source of funding
4147328 i think its a sad day for california taxpayers when were talking about health care improvements for convicted prisoners when hard working law abiding folks are having trouble finding affordable health care for themselves and their families
4147329 it just shows how one is so out of touch with reality
4147330 will continue to work with the receiver and the legislature to determine the most fiscally responsible way to provide the receiver the resources that he needs
4147331 one way or another the state will have to pay for its prison health care system
4147332 i continue to believe the legislature should approve lease revenue bonds as the fiscally appropriate way to fund prison bed construction
4147333 we have fully exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs but the states leaders have failed to act
4147334 i just hope kelso would slow down and work with the legislature and the governor to come up with the funds that he needs
4147335 law enforcement has no clear legislative guidance and medical marijuana patients have little incentive to volunteer for the cardholder program
4147336 im worried that because we have such a huge influx well not be able to get back to everyone
4147337 for us what were feeling now is if were going to pay almost all our monthly income for housing we want it to be in a location where property taxes are actually paying for something
4147338 to look outside and see all these potholes and the schools are iffy at best its crazy to stay here whats happening to us is not unique its probably what most families with kids are feeling
4147339 if youre a homeowner in california you lost value on your property this year
4147340 unless you dont mind overpaying property taxes there is no reason you should not file for a reduction

4147348 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4147349 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4147350 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4147351 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4147352 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4147353 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4147354 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4147355 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4147356 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4147357 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4147358 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4147359 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4147360 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4147361 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4147362 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4147363 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4147364 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4147365 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4147366 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4147367 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4147368 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4147369 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4147370 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4147371 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4147372 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4147373 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4147376 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4147377 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4147378 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4147379 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4147380 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4147381 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4147382 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4147383 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4147384 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4147385 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4147386 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4147387 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4147388 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4147389 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4147390 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever

4147397 john mccains campaign has been working overtime to ridicule barack obama as the one the rock star celebrity with adoring fans the politician with the chutzpah to announce his candidacy in a speech about abraham lincoln so it was a bit surprising to watch the opening of mccains town hall meeting in york pa on tuesday
4147398 whats not such a good thing is the way campaign culture tries to slap down candidates who dont seem to fit someones definition of
4147399 this is silly enough when candidates are attacked for their wealth or supposedly elitist habits its hard to see how

4147404 i would assume that a significant share of kindle sales would have been purchased in the bay area however i find it odd that i have yet to see one in action i ride bart to and from work five days a week and see dozens hundreds of ipods every week and a laptop or two or three every day but nary a kindle who has them and where are they wouldnt reading one while commuting be a primary use
4147405 to date only three individuals who have come into the shop have even mentioned having or having had the kindle i say having had because one individual lost their kindle we talked about how it is so much easier to replace a 6 99 paperback as opposed to a little box they paid hundreds for

4147407 in my research for the anthology i was able to find 140 poets living outside iran and reciting in persian no doubt this is a partial list from which i translated about 35 poets and eventually featured 18 in belonging six from each of the three generations reciting
4147408 bottom line the literature in translation has to find readership in order to have presence and impact so the questions to ask are whether enough work appears in translation whether they are the right works for the readiness of the receiving culture during a particular historical and aesthetic period and whether the translations are effective then there is the question of the editor publishers willingness to publish and invest in works of translation which compose only 0 3 to 3 percent of books published annually in the us
4147409 immigrant or exiled writers who continue to write in their mother tongue dont always have the opportunity to communicate their work to readers in their host countries since language is the tool of their metier
4147410 belonging opens a channel of communication between readers of english and iranian poets who live outside iran and recite in persian
4147411 the span of time that these canisters are going to be in this state is really finite

4147422 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4147423 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4147424 as far as liverpool is concerned i have some history there but it is a fact that 26 per cent of the city is on benefit

4147429 its a good statue of me ive got my sports jacket on and corduroy trousers

4147436 the main focus with the adoption of green it is on the data centre and energy efficiency in the data centre countries that are moving fastest in adopting green it in terms of the data centres are the more mature economies like australia new zealand japan and to a certain extent singapore
4147437 this is because cios and it managers who are operating data centres in these countries are facing tremendous constraint in terms of power supply and also the cost associated with these supply
4147438 one of the key components on the cost of an it data centre is on cooling and hp has smart cooling technologies which can help save the energy consumption by 40 per cent things like consolidation and virtualisation are some of the other technologies that can help in the green aspects of the data centre
4147439 it is possible to monetise non uk ad inventory but it is generally at much lower rates than the uk inventory the difficulty for most uk blogs and websites is that they simply dont have enough uk readers to interest ad agencies and brands so they are left to monetise even their uk traffic using ads that have very low cpms
4147440 european vcs dont tend to be too interested in media unless it is supported by a technological innovation
4147441 there is only a certain number of uk web surfers and as the bbc hoovers up a large percentage of them the slice of the cake for the independents is even smaller
4147442 secondly the bbcs reluctance to link to british blogs and smaller independent media organisations while at the same time endlessly plugging established media groups makes life even more difficult

4147449 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4147450 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4147451 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4147452 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4147453 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4147454 newports stockpile has been safely eliminated which brings the u s one step closer to fulfilling the commitment of destroying our nations chemical weapons
4147455 the bush administration and congress have failed to adequately fund the safe destruction of chemical weapons in both the u s and russia today thereby delaying the process for a decade or more and potentially undermining the global ban on this whole class of weapons of mass destruction

4147487 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
4147488 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
4147489 i won seven events if they had the 50 meter freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
4147490 hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did he reminds me of myself
4147491 mark was a very talented swimmer and very dominant in his time
4147492 the difference with michael is that he has a much more challenging program i think the competition throughout the world is more challenging
4147493 in 68 mark had tremendous pressure because he had talked a lot about how he was going surpass don schollander the first swimmer to win four golds at one olympics and he didnt fare very well under the pressure then in 72 he obviously was magnificent michael has been magnificent really since his first olympics when he was the youngest guy on the team
4147494 im sure he can afford a ticket if he wants to be here it would have been nice for him to be here and witness it i really feel he contributed a lot to swimming but its time to turn the reins over to somebody else youve got to move on with life get a life after swimming

4147646 het is weer tijd om een boodschappenlijstje samen te stellen
4147647 zover is het nog niet maar de geschiedenis leert dat deze ontwikkelingen altijd eerst worden ingeluid door grondstofprijzen die hun top bereiken en daarna dalen een eerste correctie op de commodities heeft inmiddels plaatsgevonden dus wellicht hebben ze hun hoogtepunt gehad ik ben nu dan ook gefocussed op het koersverloop van ruwe olie
4147648 dat de inflatie en de rente ook nu nog hoog zijn geeft aan we nog steeds in deze fase zitten maar we bewegen langzaam richting de laatste fase markten bewegen zich net als een langzame oceaanstomer die verandert ook niet in n keer van richting
4147649 ze kunnen denken dat het verstandig is om weer volop te beleggen voor de langere termijn maar ik blijf voorzichtig beleggers kunnen hun kruit beter droog houden de business cycle geeft nog geen aanleiding om in te stappen daarvoor is een duurzame daling van de kapitaalmarktrente tot onder de 4 noodzakelijk ook de olieprijs zal moeten dalen tot onder de 110
4147650 in 2002 bereikte de rente een hoogste stand van rond 5 35 waarna een rentedaling inzette richting 3 de rentepiek gaf het sein om obligaties te kopen maar voor aandelen was het toen nog te vroeg tussen begin 2002 en begin 2003 daalde de aex namelijk van 530 punten naar 220 punten in die periode steeg de olieprijs nog hard die verdubbelde
4147651 in ieder geval wel sneller dan ik tot voorkort zelf dacht eerder hield ik rekening met eind 2008 of volgend voorjaar maar nu zou het aankomend najaar al zover kunnen zijn overigens zijn er voor de korte termijn belegger en de speculant best kansen in de huidige markt

4147659 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis

4147661 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
4147662 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4147663 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4147664 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation

4147674 more than seven in ten pro choice mccain supporters have yet to learn that mccains position on abortion is directly at odds with their own
4147675 t heyll want to know this would mccain stock the supreme court with foes of roe v wade
4147676 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
4147677 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
4147678 love to see a point where roe is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
4147679 recognize d differing views on this question among americans in general and in our own party
4147680 i believe we are an inclusive party and we can be so without changing our principles
4147681 a private decision that we would share within our family and not with anyone else
4147682 if you want a strongly pro life president dont support john mccain
4147683 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
4147684 because i know what it is like to live without human rights where human life is accorded no inherent value
4147685 mccains advisers have said that he will not fight to soften the republican platform on abortion and mccain himself has said that it would be
4147686 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
4147687 we tried to get as many co sponsors as we could and we postured the thing as anti vigilante violence
4147688 we argued that even if you oppose abortion you should not condone these actions
4147689 there were a number of very anti choice senators who voted for face
4147690 he has never failed to cast his vote in favor of whatever abortion restrictions are arguably permitted under roe v wade bans against partial birth abortion abortions on military bases transporting minors across state lines to obtain abortions behind their parents backs and government funding for abortion both in the united states and abroad in addition mccain has voted to confirm every strict constructionist judge appointed by the various republican presidents who have served during his tenure
4147691 planned parenthood and naral pro choice america consistently award him ratings of absolute zero on their scorecards
4147692 it was one on which i disagreed with him from the beginning
4147693 wondered about the depth of mccains commitment to that position initially because i had the impression that it wasnt something that hed given a lot of thought to
4147694 when we really explored it it really came down for him to a sanctity of life question he did get very emotional one time we talked about it he truly believed
4147695 i think hes pro life because he just cant be anything else i think hes there
4147696 he immediately said that nothing could be further from the truth he all but smacked me down
4147697 i dont know enough about it to give you an informed answer
4147698 whether its abortion care birth control or comprehensive sex education mccain is not moderate or a maverick
4147699 we never ask and we never hear pro choice republicans question whether mccain will be with us on a vote hes always on the wrong side
4147700 when i went to his d c office i would be put into his waiting room forever and ever and ever and eventually a staff person would come out and put me off and finally i just gave up

4147708 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
4147709 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
4147710 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
4147711 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
4147712 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series

4147844 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4147845 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4147846 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4147847 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4147848 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4147849 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4147850 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4147851 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4147852 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4147853 if they are true to the dna of the publication

4147865 were constantly carrying out research into consumer attitudes and what weve spotted is that their primary concern as far as meat is concerned is reassurance on why they should pay more
4147866 so weve changed glens look to send out a message to them that when theyre buying scotch beef this is exactly what theyre getting a 100 per cent natural product complete with unique guarantees on production standards all the way from farm gate to dinner plate
4147867 it seems odd that they would withdraw from using such an iconic scottish symbol at a time when it is having a positive impact on sales south of the border
4147868 i would have thought keeping a hunky scotsman in a kilt would help increase sales
4147869 after all the kilt is the height of fashion these days
4147870 what our research shows is that people are staying in rather than going out to eat and when they do they want to eat the best quality beef
4147871 scotch beef is recognised as a premium product so when people are shopping for entertaining in theyre choosing to buy it rather than cheaper perhaps lesser quality meat

4147894 lo que est haciendo el consell es una verg enza de los m s de doscientos casos en calp la generalitat no ha resuelto ninguno y asi ocurre en toda la comunitat la generalitat incurre en un grave acto de irresponsabilidad al no aplicar la ley

4147901 no se ha dejado nada a la improvisaci n gracias a algo b sico como ha sido la colaboraci n entre las administraciones implicadas y colectivos de seguridad como polic as guardias civiles y bomberos
4147902 desde el principio todas las administraciones hemos trabajado juntas en un total de 15 reuniones que hemos mantenido para elaborar este dispositivo de seguridad
4147903 as es como se hizo tambi n a la hora de realizar otros eventos como la americas cup la visita del papa o la volvo ocean race con colaboraci n para tener atado cualquier m nimo detalle

4147916 im extremely happy im overwhelmed at the response received here
4147917 i want to spend more time with my family and my friends i need a long break
4147918 on tuesday following her second devastating defeat in two days manaudou had said she was contemplating quitting the swimming competition midway through
4147919 im going to take a long break to think about other things
4147920 he was the first person i ever fought over maybe 22
4147921 thats one victory from a guaranteed medal and three wins from gold hell fight south koreas kim jung joo on sunday for a semifinal place
4147922 i had the psychological advantage because my opponent is stronger than me so i have no pressure
4147923 secondly my strategy is quite good i took advantage of my height and kept distance from my opponent
4147924 chinese welterweight hanati silamu also beat overmatched joseph mulema of cameroon 9 4 to advance within one victory of a medal china which has never won gold in a sport banned by under chairman mao zedong has seven boxers still alive in the olympics unbelievably more than the russians
4147925 its a big weight off my shoulders now i know i havent got a medal
4147926 its been brilliant coming here but theres so much pressure with the training and not seeing my family now i can be back with my family and live a normal boys life
4147927 unheralded egyptian welterweight hosam abdin got the session off to a remarkable start with an 11 10 victory over thailands non boonjumnong who finished second at last years worlds abdin hung on in the final two rounds even after his coach was kicked out of his corner for being too vocal
4147928 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4147929 i didnt expect it would be easy to win but i didnt expect this either
4147930 so what is there to be afraid of in competition
4147931 the weight of representing your country at the world championships and at the olympics is different its much heavier here
4147932 i couldnt turn the support of the fans into a strength for me
4147933 we got some practice in the group matches its like a single elimination competition too because only the top team in each group can play for the gold
4147934 so during every game there was quite a bit of pressure and that will be helpful in the semifinals and finals
4147935 compared to the chinese team we dont have as much pressure
4147936 i think theyre the strongest team for them to win the gold that would be routine
4147937 wang liqin had been unsteady on two previous outings but he regained his stride against austrias werner schlager who at no 16 in the world was the highest ranked opponent for the chinese so far
4147938 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
4147939 any team that can win their groups at the olympics are quite strong these teams are basically chinas primary opponents
4147940 maybe overall china is stronger but on an individual basis theyve beaten us before in singles matches or other contests
4147941 we can make more in mobile than desktop eventually the reason is because the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone everywhere it knows all about you we can do a very very targeted ad over time we will make more money for mobile advertising

4148000 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4148001 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4148002 i consider that to be bluster coming form the foreign minister of russia and we will ignore it
4148003 there are some reports that things have quieted down and then you do hear of some flare ups
4148004 what you have is a rural area in many cases and a lot of equipment that looks similar so some of the reports you hear they need to be checked out

4148014 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama

4148025 back in 2001 one of those nights with loads of beer and metal i was introduced to
4148026 i started taking everything apart piecing the elements back together in new ways creating something symbolic and almost surreal everything painted to give the feel of something soulful and to a certain extent timeless and using sharp contrasts in dark light and colour all this to get a cover with atmosphere and punch a cover that would fit and reflect enslaved s music dark epic and brutal yet beautiful
4148027 the actual composition of the artwork is a continuation of our cooperation with the wonderful and talented artist truls espedal we once again managed to get a thousand ideas visualized in one brilliant piece this time we have also added some colour to the usual bleakness making it both more beautiful and dangerous
4148028 one of the strongest albums to emerge from the extreme metal scene
4148029 the sound songs and atmosphere mark a great leap for the band and genre as a whole
4148030 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
4148031 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals
4148032 bands always say our new album is faster and heavier and then its never true so were not gonna say that but playing fast just works for us people who say we play too fast are probably right but guess what theres a million other bands that play slow people listen to dragonforce and go to the show because they know that were doing something other bands arent doing
4148033 a group of 10 legislators five from each party has put together a compromise bill which would do exactly what the republicans say they want it would open up protected areas to drilling while also boosting efficiency and renewables obama and pelosi have both signaled in the last week that they would be willing to support the bill they will give a little ground on drilling which they dont favor in order to put in place measures that support renewables which they do favor for their efforts the media has now said theyve flip flopped on drilling meanwhile mccain has refused to support the compromise house republicans have refused to support the compromise rush limbaugh and his band of dittoheads are going absolutely ballistic on the compromise flooding the legislators responsible with angry phone calls and claiming that its going to sink mccains presidential campaign to summarize democratic leaders have signaled that they are willing to meet republicans halfway in order to pass a comprehensive energy policy republicans have refused demanding a vote that would do nothing but serve the interests of their oil company donors
4148034 our workforce needs qualified well trained employees if we are to achieve our vision of an innovative dynamic economy it is only by increasing the skill set of our workforce that we can hope to attract the inward investment we need to grow our economy
4148035 step up is playing a key role in helping us achieve that goal providing 500 qualified skilled potential employees that would otherwise not have existed and that inward investors are very attracted to
4148036 since its inception in 2000 step up has been hugely successful in achieving its objectives of raising the aspirations motivation and performance of students who might otherwise have never gone to university
4148037 step up is as an outstanding example of best practice in the provision of educational opportunities for students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds
4148038 you have earned the right to progress to higher education through your ability and hard work your success is living proof that access to higher education can and should be based on merit and not upon the social class into which individuals are born or the type of school that they attend
4148039 since our launch eight years ago 97 of the students who have completed the programme have progressed to university step up clearly demonstrates what can be achieved when universities in partnership with schools and industry are encouraged to strengthen and enrich the secondary school curriculum and actively engage students in academic work that they perceive as meaningful and motivating

4148086 the mound is a little like a desert island in that there are these two people in an isolated place
4148087 its like two people in bed in the middle of a stadium the absurdity of them having a private conversation in the most public arena is ultimately whats so funny

4148095 being in a major involves being in a community of other students and faculty members
4148096 multiple majors and minors present a particular kind of challenge and sense of satisfaction because it entails pursuing a subject in some considerable depth and moving from one question to another question to another set of questions
4148097 everybody gasps with awe when you say youre triple majoring with minors and a full time job and 24 hours of community service a week
4148098 they get ahold of this idea in high school that there needs to be something unique about them
4148099 and they mistake what makes them unique in high school for what makes them unique in adult life
4148100 its proven that people who get straight as are not necessarily successful in the work world
4148101 at least during my tenure ive never been able to propose this type of revenue to the commission
4148102 we dont normally do two day events the operative word being normally
4148103 in another planets case they were very persistent theyd been working with us for some time and they believed in this so they approached me its sort of like rewarding persistence if you will based on their record and our discussion with them we believe that they are a high capacity producer that would definitely have the wherewithal to present the event for us the staff recommendation is approval
4148104 the parks provide us a quiet respite in a highly stressful life
4148105 we go into a park and were in beautiful california again what do you say we have no amplified music and we do podcasts to everybody be silent out there theyd all have their headphones on out there thatd be great
4148106 we have frequently asked if the park can accommodate larger longer shows through our usual contacts and were always told no it is wrong not to solicit us and other san francisco entities to participate in the selection process enabling another planet to acquire this privilege unilaterally for even one year gives them an unfair advantage in the future both inside the city and within my industry
4148107 i mean it was a small podunk little town out in nowhere but everybody knew the playpen was there
4148108 he used his job as a police officer like he was controlling the playpen like it was his own little entity
4148109 i was always in my opinion one of the better liked cops because i didnt take a real hard line approach i had reasonable common sense i would try to defuse something before i took someone to jail
4148110 they would do it to a lot of cops and all the cops would do the same thing so i dont know if lewis was you know honoring the uniform or he just didnt like it
4148111 i dont know if its like policy that you cant touch a cop but he didnt seem to be letting them enjoy themselves
4148112 i think it just depends on the attorney and how much his heart is in it
4148113 i was happy to see that they had filed charges but it did surprise me
4148114 we thought unless the state had something they wouldnt have brought all those charges against lewis but i dont know the whole deal
4148115 the reason i think they took it to a grand jury is because this evidence is so weak
4148116 the grand jury only gets to hear what the prosecution wants them to hear and they clearly with those witnesses didnt want anybody cross examining them
4148117 these are some bleepin strippers what are they thinking i wear a badge the credibility should swing my way every one of these girls has a troubled background
4148118 its so bizarre i couldnt believe it went this far being a cop knowing the law i could never have arrested me for this
4148119 it would look like a mixed drink and they would pay for a mixed drink so the bar would make their money
4148120 never did i hang out with them outside the club i didnt associate myself with that place
4148121 he turned around and went home tried to call me and make it right
4148122 yeah yeah yeah he was probably real impressed that they even wanted to talk to him that was not a good move on his part
4148123 i told dave one of the mistakes he made was becoming a cop at the age of 43 thats something you do when youre 25 and then you learn by being in that environment that theres certain things you do and certain things you dont to cover your own ass
4148124 ive known gunner for years i know how he is
4148125 she cried she was emotive she appeared to be a good looking demure sweet quiet girl
4148126 who dances naked on men for a living ya know
4148127 why did lewis call perry at 3 23 a m
4148128 what happened was not the result that i hoped for i was hoping for him to get professional help
4148129 i thought it was absolutely horseshit and theyre trying to crucify my brother for being a dumbshit basically
4148130 for her to piss backward on us like she did i think just undermined our efforts to have a successful prosecution on the remaining cases
4148131 you know what happened they thought i knew more than i really knew and they panicked they really did
4148132 this not a good week for fast food is it ever while burger king is dealing with a prized employee

4148200 purdue is the most aggressive of the big ten universities in filing patents and starting new companies based on purdue technologies
4148201 in 2006 purdue had 14 startup companies which was third in the nation behind the university of california system and the university of utah this fund will help us augment our desire to move discoveries from the laboratory to the market where they can help people
4148202 the discovery park paradigm fosters a strong interdisciplinary approach to research and provides purdue university researchers with unparalleled opportunities to collaborate on research and discoveries
4148203 the emerging innovations fund is another important step in providing the additional support that is needed to move discoveries to the public

4148210 i congratulate these green building leaders they have demonstrated a clear commitment to education and professionalism to earn this designation
4148211 of course we expected the cgp to be popular because as green building grows many consumers are looking for a builder with real credentials in todays market
4148212 nevertheless this is phenomenal growth the home building industry clearly sees the value of this designation and consumers will as well
4148213 home owners and home buyers are demanding more green products and features in their homes and the building industry wants to meet that demand thats how this market works
4148214 the cgp designation is a sign of professional commitment these 1 000 are ready and i can guarantee there are hundreds more just waiting to join their ranks

4148233 these alarming findings clearly show that a partially open smoking area is still an unsafe environment where people are exposed to harmful levels of secondhand smoke
4148234 the situation is unacceptable and confirms that the 2007 changes to the law did not go far enough to protect patrons or workers
4148235 nsw should effectively separate smoking areas from working including eating spaces
4148236 i am excited to see the progress we have made in developing our utilityeye r product line with our new capabilities we expect the market for sars products to be expanded considerably
4148237 tscs involvement has been invaluable for us to do business at the airport items run so much more smoothly than before they were involved
4148238 without the tscs involvement the airport could not comply with tsa mandates and directives the fingerprint chrc record keeping alone is a monumental task that the faa was facing difficulty with
4148239 we are proud of tscs consistent record of excellent customer service to airports and the aviation industry
4148240 in the six years that tsc has been in operation weve reduced the average turnaround time for a background check weve developed a system with an error rate four times lower than the average federal agency and weve reduced the price our customers pay the tsc also provides a key role as the central identity management system for the registered traveler program and serves as an outstanding example of the results that a first class team can produce
4148241 choosing from such a wide variety of outstanding entries is a challenge every year and the quality of this years entries was particularly high
4148242 the winners clearly reflect our judging criteria innovation strategic importance to the market competitive advantage and exceptional value to customers
4148243 we are gratified that a catbird innovation has again received such wonderful recognition

4148248 this investment will better enable wal mart to lower prices for many argentineans we also explained to our hosts our companys commitment to sustainable development which is one of primary global objectives
4148249 this growth will result in the creation of new jobs at these locations while developing the business of small and medium sized suppliers in argentina
4148250 our experience is that everywhere we operate our company reduces prices for all consumers simply by being a good competitor and that is a benefit to everyone
4148251 we expect our company will have 27 stores by the end of this year and more than 40 by the end of next year
4148252 we are pleased that our new investment plan for argentina is accelerating and is now even greater than we had committed to former president n stor kirchner
4148253 a result of the companys outstanding performance within argentinas market growth and a signal that reflects the trust with regards to the countrys economy future
4148254 its like the starter plant for budding green thumbs one that emboldens people for more technically challenging garden therapy
4148255 it is amazing how a noticeable star such as ms denise richards is attracted to our inca designs label we are very appreciative of the wonderful acceptance she has shown toward our swimwear and resort wear products we look forward to continuing to create designs that are sought after by such celebrities
4148256 it is great significance to a company like ours to be featured in the biggest weekly magazine such as us weekly where circulation is over 1 8 billion on average to be a mentioned in a magazine with so many readers it is obviously a great marketing tool for inca designs inc
4148257 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4148258 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4148259 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4148260 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4148261 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
4148262 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
4148263 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
4148264 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
4148265 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
4148266 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4148267 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4148268 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
4148269 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
4148270 behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem
4148271 instead of enforcing the law you are becoming a criminal police force
4148272 you should have been fighting for the jews right to reach their lands and instead you are a criminal police force
4148273 they help the arab criminals who build on jewish land in jerusalem and instead of destroying the illegal arab houses they prevent the owner of the land in jerusalem from going into the land
4148274 what were seeing here is the second division of jerusalem once they divide jerusalem with the separation fence and now even what is inside the so called jewish part of jerusalem is being divided by declaring that there are places here to which jews have no access
4148275 in a lot of the plots i find arabs are living and building illegally and also working the jnf land without permission
4148276 during the years of the intifada the municipality had difficulty carrying out the necessary level of enforcement in the neighborhoods of eastern jerusalem due to security constraints
4148277 whoever thinks its possible to live with 270 000 arabs in eastern jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more tractors and more cars carrying out terror attacks
4148278 you have a suspicious substance that was found in a hotel room in conjunction with person being a foreign national and we have a lot of questions and that is why we are assisting

4148304 with better management of fertilizers and the elimination of runoff or evaporation we are accomplishing more than we have in the past using drip irrigation
4148305 our primary objective is to utilize our irrigation water better with drip irrigation systems
4148306 with the irrigation planning and designs being approved through the nrcs i know our systems are meeting better standards and we are utilizing our water more efficiently
4148307 as available irrigation water in the region continues to decline producers have to use their water more efficiently while trying to maximize production
4148308 precision application promotes better use of irrigation which is what the heinrichs are looking for to maximize water use efficiency
4148309 a lot of central texas and blackland region yields have been disappointing
4148310 it was so wet so cold on todays rating that yield projection for the area of 155 bushels to the acre is just amazing whats interesting in the report they lowered planted acres and increased harvested that tells you they got the crop back in replanted it or the crop survived on some acres that werent expected to

4148319 our main focus is on the league but that is not to the exclusion of the fai cup the cup is a very important competition and we will be doing everything to progress to the next round
4148320 we could not have gotten a harder draw our opponents are the reigning league champions and they have a squad that is second to none
4148321 drogheda may believe that the cup is the best route to silverware for them and they will compete vigorously to progress
4148322 sharon osbourne ozzys wife spent his money the chanel store on robertson
4148323 all of these things are coming together in a confluence of events thats creating tremendous pressure on the industry
4148324 thats why i think its very important for the australian government to respond in kind and respond favourably to support the domestic industry
4148325 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what they are preaching

4148337 as i look forward to 2009 i want to be represented in the u s senate by two minnesota senators who will support and vote to advance our positive action oriented democratic agenda to strengthen our economy keep our nation secure and invest in our countrys future
4148338 that means in this years race for the u s senate i will be voting for al franken
4148339 this spring i voiced concerns about material from als past career
4148340 to have remained silent when asked would have been hypocritical and dishonest i am confident my concerns have been heard and since then i have watched als campaign take steps to address these matters
4148341 now i believe al and his campaign are appropriately focused on building a solid relationship with voters based on our shared minnesota values ideals and hopes for the future like all candidates al understands that he is not only asking minnesotans for their vote but for their trust
4148342 as november 4th approaches al franken will earn the trust of minnesotans and i intend to work with him to win this election
4148343 we believe al franken is the u s senate candidate that minnesota women and families can count on to protect and strengthen their health and rights we know that al franken will stand with minnesotans on reproductive health and on affordable and quality health care for all
4148344 the answer was clear al franken will stand up for womens health care
4148345 he will be a leader in improving access to quality health care for women and will support and protect a womans right to choose planned parenthood intends to defeat norm coleman in the fall and al franken is the candidate to do just that
4148346 norm coleman is not a moderate he is no friend to women and if elected he will toe the line of the anti choice hardliners

4148350 what we need are words that are turned into deeds the actions of love
4148351 engage in what is clearly a major issue in our world today christian muslim relationships
4148352 but i have been especially impressed this week with the comfortable candor with which muslims and christians have clearly stated their own doctrines to one another
4148353 in attendance and in agreement sadly were both the head of the national association of evangelicals and the world evangelical alliance
4148354 dont these evangelical leaders know that deception is part and parcel of the muslim religion when they deal with infidels do they really think american mosques are going to start heralding christianity once a year and really mean it dont they know that many american mosques certainly not all are the breeding ground for calling for the destruction of america and its takeover by islam
4148355 forgive my cynicism but i think the muslims are laughing all the way to mecca
4148356 is a buzzword with sexual consultants how can young people be taught the facts of life over their mobile phones other than that i have developed a
4148357 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan
4148358 the only way they would have been compensated would have been that 55 million stop and think of that
4148359 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
4148360 were looking at people who have got severe psychological problems
4148361 theres research that people who inflict cruelty on animals then move on and become involved in violence against people
4148362 people like martin bryant the tasmanian mass killer and ted bundy the us serial killer had previous history of cruelty to animals
4148363 so you have to look at whoevers done this in the same vein that they have the propensity to move on and commit atrocious crimes against people as well
4148364 weve got horses cattle depending on the time of year we sometimes have alpacas sheep goats chooks
4148365 its quite a big area sort of interspersed among gum trees she and other staff at the school are clearly upset
4148366 these kids have been working with these animals over a period of time and they obviously have an attachment to them and its very very disappointing
4148367 it would have counted toward the students final marks but clearly therell be extenuating circumstances and the teachers will take that into account with the marking
4148368 we think the people responsible should come forward first because we have some pretty good information that will be followed

4148383 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4148384 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4148385 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4148386 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4148387 getting rid of personnel who had the necessary experiences to make sure these things get done correctly
4148388 certainly the engineering services department is one of them its feeling the same as we are and obviously the guys are overworked and have a multitude of stuff to go through
4148389 unfortunately when you dont have the resources things get missed
4148390 and it was during that process that certain things were missed
4148391 weve been trying to highlight over the last couple of years that engineering management thats come into qantas over the last five years and then changed again about three years ago doesnt really have a full understanding of what engineering does
4148392 the call out for relubrication therefore was not automatic and our back up record checking highlighted the issue
4148393 was the latest example of the lengths the image obsessed china is taking to create a perfect summer games
4148394 id buy you a ring like this if you looked after things nicer
4148395 the launch of bbc alba is a wonderful milestone for broadcasting
4148396 the most important priority for mg alba is that viewers and listeners receive high quality television radio and online services and im delighted that we are establishing this new service through the historic collaboration between mg alba and the bbc
4148397 radio 1 is here to champion the very best in new music and new dj talent and i believe that these schedule changes mean we can continue to do this even more effectively
4148398 kissy kutski and mistajam are djs who are completely passionate about the music they play and the audience they play to im really happy that they will now all have their own regular shows
4148399 our newest recruits heidi van den amstel jaymo and andy george are a fantastic addition to the in new djs we trust line up
4148400 id also like to thank both dave and eddie for their commitment to radio 1 and wish them all the very best for the future
4148401 how could you do this big brother on my last night how could you do this
4148402 i was saying that in real terms i wouldnt trip anyone for the money
4148403 joe takes pressure off me because hes the one who gets the innings going
4148404 for me especially young guys when they come into your side you want to see if theyve got a technique and can hit the ball well in one day cricket
4148405 joe as well as anchoring an innings can take advantage of the power plays and i dont see him hiding in the big games
4148406 in the semi final he hit his first century of this competition 102 v durham and this was a televised game with steve harmison bowling as fast as he did in the test match
4148407 as a young guy it can be a bit daunting opening the innings but you just see the bloke looking like hes enjoying it and its the big occasion where he seems to come good
4148408 over the last two years he has got hundreds in the four day game and good runs in the one day game
4148409 in england we are always looking for a adam gilchrist or a sanath jayasuriya
4148410 what the selectors have got wrong is they end up picking a technically correct batsman who cant take advantage of power plays or someone who can but hasnt got much technique
4148411 joe is someone who can hit a good length ball on the up through the covers he plays the short ball pretty well but also gets stuck in where its needed
4148412 thats what england have missed in the past few years
4148413 all i know is that wicketkeepers should catch and no excuses
4148414 fozzie as a gloveman looks very very good up to the stumps when people like seamer david masters are bowling it helps them because he puts you under pressure as a batman
4148415 the middle order is one of the toughest places to bat in 50 over cricket
4148416 fozzie seems to do it pretty well gets the scoreboard going straight away and hits the ball in strange places and hits a few long balls as well like joe and ravi whatever the situation they try to win the game
4148417 i had a fantastic time for the twenty20 period and ive been able to follow it up with the games after that so its been a good summer
4148418 over the years ive always been able to play cameo innings of 40 or 50 in a short space of time
4148419 as a junior schoolboy i was able to hit a few hundreds along the way then essex gave me the chance to go up the order and that one game came off for me against sussex and gave me confidence to keep on playing in that style and fingers crossed beat keysies side at the weekend
4148420 its difficult to explain how or why what went right that day it was like the ball was in slow motion and the bat twice as big i felt twice as strong
4148421 i was pushed up to bat at three after getting a 37 against middlesex after batting at eight
4148422 they said to me you look like youre in form give it a go and from that innings i built on a good base foundation the first few runs came a bit scratchily and theres a point when you start to go for it
4148423 not ready to lead and obama has run a positive national message but also battleground state ads calling mccain like president bush
4148424 put hard working americans first by growing the economy eliminate tax cuts for companies that send jobs overseas create new jobs at home invest in education and cut taxes for working families
4148425 the platforms that nbc has for its exclusive olympics coverage the obama campaign says

4148429 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4148430 these offences occurred at st pius x high school in adamstown the charlestown parish and taree parish
4148431 police will also be reliant upon evidence of similar facts pertaining to offences committed at waverley college by a further complainant
4148432 lindsay lohan is an actress shes become notorious for her off stage and screen exploits and her tabloid lifestyle i believe she has been connected to drugs sauciness and sexiness in equal measure though she seems like a nice girl to me
4148433 the jonas brothers is a band theyre all actual brothers and they all came out of the same womb where many have said they studiously rehearsed their instruments how the jonas mother was able to keep an amp in her uterus is one of the greatest mysteries because them boys were born already possessing an incredible talent
4148434 in england we have such good manners that if someone says something impolite the police will get involved christian bale i believe whilst in a restaurant rolled his eyes at the lighting that is an offense punishable by five years in prison in the united kingdom i admire christian bale and i think hes one of the greatest living actors on the planet currently but we cannot shirk when it comes to good manners if its true that he also dropped a napkin on his way to the lavatory then i think that he should possibly receive the death penalty
4148435 i think that the idea of democracy is an illusion and regardless of who becomes president the status quo will maintain power its irrelevant who you select as the totem of power in the country because the country will be run in the same way but i would rather have a black president than a white one i would have ideally liked a hermaphrodite president one can only hope that the rights of hermaphrodites will be recognized yeah a hermaphrodite president i just havent found a hermaphrodite whose policies i agree with even though i do like the idea of having mutual opposed genitals
4148436 we continue to prepare the business to deal with any consequences of the current economic climate
4148437 our capacity cuts for next year are not a sign that we believe customers will not go on holiday they are about delivering our merger plans and cutting out unprofitable and duplicated product
4148438 capacity can be added relatively easily if demand remains strong
4148439 peoples holiday is sacrosanct and our trading metrics show no evidence that customers are curtailing their holiday plans
4148440 we find that people are even more keen to get away on a great value holiday and relax in the sun when the economic environment gets more difficult
4148441 millions of people live and work in terrible conditions but the government doesnt think of them
4148442 they have spent our taxes on buildings and who does it help it does nothing for the people of this country
4148443 its all for beijing but what about the rest of the country
4148444 what about those who lost their homes in the earthquake what about the people who try to feed their families and send their children out to work
4148445 hey thelma pretty soon theyse gonna have the nukular clouds over iran the rooskies gonna nuke israel and then jaysus gonna come in glory to scoop us up dont fergit the camera
4148446 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4148447 mr president im not saying we wouldnt get our hair mussed but no more than 10 to 20 million tops depending on the breaks
4148448 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4148449 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4148450 look look another hitler georgia is finland south ossetia is the sudentenland more bombs more tanks more carriers more war more death and destruction all hail the gods of war
4148451 stamp out as many typos as we can find in public signage and other venues where innocent eyes may be befouled by vile stains on the delicate fabric of our language is dedicated to a more perfectly spelling union
4148452 im sorry but i find it hard to believe that lyra who has more integrity than most of us at the lab would steal anything
4148453 your investigator came into my home bound me with a sophomoric binding spell at best and took my book without permission if that is not theft then what is it
4148454 well someone had better start explaining because im very close to firing someone
4148455 no one is getting fired im sure there is a logical explanation for all of this isnt there lyra
4148456 if this stubborn jerk hadnt refused to help with the translation i wouldnt have done anything so so drastic

4148458 el recato con el que se guarda lo sagrado lo que es expresi n de un verdadero amor

4148462 im of the mind to say it wouldnt be a bad thing to disappear for a year or two years
4148463 a lot of people would say culture moves too fast and you need to remind people but i would argue theres not any rush maybe therell be a sex scandal or an arrest or something to keep us in the news

4148480 while defendant ericson tozay and his fianc e were in their bedroom an argument ensued between them which resulted into a scuffle subsequently tozay who has been suspecting his fianc e of having extra love affairs took a kitchen knife and inflicted multiple wounds on her body
4148481 on the calendar were about ten days behind from our planting dates but thats due to the cool weather which was beneficial through the growing season
4148482 when the grain gets ripe and gets cured out and it gets rained on gets dried up gets rained on again were going to end up with potential quality issues
4148483 up here we only got a few inches of rain but at the farm we had better than four inches of rain so yeah it definitely set us back
4148484 its soft but it looks like if we stay on the high ground well be okay for most of it so
4148485 global warming is a reality but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to co2 emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
4148486 my god you went awol didnt you what if they find you here
4148487 theyll get it working again once the fleet gets here
4148488 karl what are you going to do where will you go
4148489 let me stay here please just let me stay until the fleet comes
4148490 yeah ive got it but i dont even give a damn any more
4148491 maybe the fleets lost maybe it never left earth there wont be any spare parts or equipment and the electricity will never come back on and well eventually run out of everything we brought suppose its all true i could handle that i could even handle that my parents and my sister my real sister
4148492 what will they do when they find you gone wouldnt it be better to just finish your tour cant you wait until then
4148493 wait until we get to paradise you said now its wait until you finish your tour at least let me stay tonight
4148494 one of the refrains have you ever been hit in the head with a blackberry by foxy brown well then you aint hip hop
4148495 my dad sells shoes but he used to be famous and hes really good friends with mark wahlbergs brother
4148496 well its partly true you have fun with your friends you organise house parties you go out you flirt yet you often argue with your parents who can sometimes be very annoying
4148497 true we laugh a lot with our friends and go to night clubs but it is slightly wrong too because we have spots we are often tired because of school which is difficult and teenagers are very intolerant with one another
4148498 yes i agree but only to a certain extent we meet lots of people we go to discos ok but we have a lot of homework to do when we go back home after school and it is a lot of stress
4148499 teenage is a golden age because you are free to do what you want but on the other hand theres school i dont like school it is not interesting
4148500 being a teenager is great im in good health i have no wrinkles at the weekend i go out with my friends when my parents are absent i have parties at my house i often play on my computer or with my playstation but on the other hand i must study and work im sometimes fraught
4148501 isnt that the one where they randomly burst into song
4148502 querido filho estou triste porque ao que parece n o vou poder plantar meu jardim este ano

4148504 no she doesnt want some of your m amp ms
4148505 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
4148506 theres no need to feel guilty for that is my small token of appreciation to you
4148507 dan katakanlah bekerjalah kamu maka allah dan rasul nya serta orang orang mukmin akan melihat pekerjaanmu itu dan kamu akan dikembalikan kepada allah yang maha mengetahui akan yang ghaib dan yang nyata

4148511 no surprise that as soon as theres a big outage everyone howls this happens with corporate networks and e mail systems and applications too of course the real question is which is more reliable
4148512 i expect that over time the web based apps will get better and better they will have to unfortunately the pressures on predominate internal e mail systems may not be on such an improvement trajectory
4148513 at this point it is risky for enterprises to move over to gmail and google apps given this past behavior
4148514 in short if google cant get this right someone else will

4148516 energy prices do seem to be coming down a bit so im hopeful that going forward we wont see as much of an increase
4148517 that decline will translate into lower gasoline prices and lower prices across the board
4148518 now that the tidal surge in energy and other commodity costs is showing unmistakable signs of turning up in consumer prices at large the fed finds itself pushed further into the corner
4148519 the recent report on retail sales coupled with todays report indicates that a dip in real consumer spending is now underway
4148520 consumers are trying to scrimp and save and they have to because their incomes are not going up
4148521 in fact they are not even running in place they are moving backward
4148522 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
4148523 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
4148524 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve

4148590 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4148591 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4148592 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4148593 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4148594 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4148595 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4148596 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4148597 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4148598 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4148599 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4148600 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4148601 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4148602 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4148603 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4148620 nobody ever thinks something like this is going to happen over the weekend watching what was happening it really started to hit me that wow these girls are in a war zone and i dont know how were going to get them home

4148630 the provisional cease fire that was agreed to really must go into place
4148631 she seemed like she was a very good mother to her
4148632 when she would be in the room she lit the room up
4148633 the other thing thats so great is hes breathing through his nose now
4148634 when she put them on myself and my daughter thought oh my goodness it is inappropriate because it is sexually suggestive
4148635 you just never know who could see that and think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
4148636 this is part of a worrying trend of inappropriate clothing marketed at young children
4148637 we have never interfered in pakistans internal matters pakistan should do the same
4148638 every pakistani is with our brothers and sisters in srinagar kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani

4148640 two judges have already found hes violated conditions of his bond
4148641 this is the first time a judge has stood up for him
4148642 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4148643 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4148644 three coalition service members were killed in an explosion while on a dismounted patrol in southern afghanistan today
4148645 in the past two weeks weve lost 15 policemen in fighting with taliban in nad ali this morning we had to withdraw from two posts
4148646 we are saddled with the painful but important task of completing the implementation of the international court of justices judgment by handing the bakassi peninsula to cameroon
4148647 we should not see this handover as a loss for nigeria or as a sign of weakness but our profound respect for international law and good neighbourliness
4148648 before we never had problems like this just a few bad people causing trouble
4148649 im feeling really frightened now its not safe at all
4148650 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
4148651 you cannot trust barack obama with our partys nomination he has no experience and has accomplished nothing as a senator
4148652 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
4148653 i just thought it was too tilted to the wealthy and i still do
4148654 if his original proposal came to a vote on the senate floor he would not vote for it
4148655 can have the team around him that he wants around him
4148656 i m the only one that said that rumsfeld had to go
4148657 against a bill that would require the central intelligence agency to abide by the restrictions on interrogating prisoners outlined in the army field manual
4148658 mccain like his republican brethren have been in big oils pocket and have fought against energy independence and after the energy crisis of 73 theres just no excuse for that the republicans and big oil sold out america

4148660 among those displaced are people who have had to abandon their homes several times in the recent months
4148661 many people have received basic humanitarian relief but as the number of displaced persons increases so do their needs
4148662 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaittivu districts remains tense and unpredictable with ongoing military operations and exchange of mortar artillery shelling and air attacks
4148663 a lot of people are sleeping in makeshift shelters we expect the numbers to climb up from about 112 000 to 200 000 displaced people if fighting gets worse in the weeks ahead
4148664 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit
4148665 as a business decision we definitely would have to look at it
4148666 but it doesnt mean that youre on the next flight out

4148714 commenters noted that even in this age of technology and internet access there is still a valuable and important role that libraries and communities play for providing access to information
4148715 librarians pointed out the importance of the epa libraries and the need to reopen the closed libraries
4148716 the critical role of research librarians was mentioned and acknowledged broadly by the group with some participants going so far as to argue that all data or records released by epa should include contact information for a person or steward who can answer technical questions or provide other informed assistance
4148717 official content should not be posted on a website or page where it may appear with commercial or political information
4148718 the idea of the project is to tag those documents and then well upload them to the archive for preservation hopefully some library s will then be able to catalog them for better long term access
4148719 more and more analysts are coming around to that view

4148721 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4148722 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4148723 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4148724 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4148725 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4148726 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4148727 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4148728 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4148729 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4148730 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4148731 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4148732 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot
4148733 there is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this for the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network we will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares
4148734 there will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with aa outbound and taking a fare with ba on the inbound leg
4148735 it is anti competitive it will force up fares and it will mean that passengers get a worse service because if you get rid of competitors by combining ba with aa you have got no one snapping at your heels to make you improve your product
4148736 this is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001 anybody can come in and compete

4148758 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4148759 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4148760 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
4148761 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
4148762 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them

4148768 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4148769 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4148770 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4148771 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4148772 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4148773 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4148774 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4148775 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november

4148778 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
4148779 inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august the 6th
4148780 mr president did you hold off speaking out and acting because of these assurances
4148781 your reliance on russian promises would explain your inadequate response to a clear act of aggression
4148782 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4148783 why cant i be still in my spirit and get an answer
4148784 hopefully i will get a bit more freedom to run around the pitch and cause a bit of terror
4148785 last year we played a few different ways and at the end i was let off the leash that style of play suits me best being able to move forward and get back
4148786 i need to add more goals to my game and the target for this season is to score nine or 10
4148787 we will be looking to play the same kind of free flowing football that we produced last season we were written off last season and just look what we managed to achieve
4148788 we all want to try and match what we did last season and hopefully take that next step to try and push into the top four or five
4148789 last season a lot of people said we wouldnt even get into the top ten but we have a very hungry young team here so everything is possible
4148790 i think people can see the longevity of goalkeepers when they see who is playing in the premier league david james edwin van der sar and myself
4148791 there are a lot of goalkeepers who have longer careers if they are lucky with injury and they look after themselves
4148792 it seems like a pretty young squad here at villa and hopefully i can add some experience
4148793 only in america could this stupid article be taken seriously cuz were so bored well read any trash

4148799 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4148800 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4148801 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4148802 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4148803 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4148804 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4148805 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4148806 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4148807 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4148808 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4148809 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4148810 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4148811 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4148812 ah sou esperta irei de rasteirinha e quero ver eles me vencerem nessa porfia

4148818 the report may intensify the debate between those fed policy makers that forecast inflation will slow and those concerned that price pressures will accelerate increases beyond food and fuel including gains in clothing airline fares and education make it less likely that central bankers will be able to keep interest rates unchanged for long

4148821 we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
4148822 i mean its not as if we get a comfortable and secure retirement just because we reach a certain age the real issue in determining when you can retire is whether youve got enough in savings and other resources so you can leave your job yet still live the lifestyle you want or at least one thats acceptable to you
4148823 whats more this sort of assessment isnt something that you should be leaving to the eve of your expected retirement date you should ideally keep tabs over the course of your career on your progress toward a comfortable retirement and at the very least once you hit the home stretch that is when youre within 10 or so years of when you hope to retire you should be doing a fairly rigorous analysis every year or so to confirm whether youre still on track to achieve your target retirement date and if not re assess your plan

4148842 through this partnership with servicenation we can be part of an historic effort to inspire americans to act together to get more directly involved in and connected to their real life communities

4148849 the last text i had from him said one more walk and then i will have done everything i wanted to do
4148850 it was the sort of thing he absolutely loved to do
4148851 we know right up until a minute or so before he died he was probably at his absolute happiest
4148852 we feel that those last two weeks of his life were probably absolutely fantastic and he was really happy
4148853 they explained that he had not turned up at the rendezvous to get the train back
4148854 at that point i knew my son was dead i just knew
4148855 he had fallen from a huge height it looks as if he probably died straight away thats some sort of comfort to us in some way
4148856 our biggest fear was that he was lying there wondering why nobody had come to find him
4148857 we dont feel theres anybody to blame except that perhaps tom made some sort of mistake it was just a dreadful dreadful accident
4148858 he was absolutely outgoing he was always looking for a challenge he achieved everything he wanted to achieve
4148859 tom would do anything for anybody he was one of those people who would talk to anybody he was a really great kid
4148860 he was passionate about green issues and stood for the green party in the local elections in may he ultimately wanted to be an mp for the green party
4148861 he had already booked to go to russia and mongolia next year on a scouts project to help street urchins
4148862 a huge part of toms life was scouting and his life would not have been what it was without the scouts
4148863 were finding it very hard to accept that we will never see him again its going to take a very very long time
4148864 toms close relatives were informed of his disappearance on saturday afternoon they flew to liechtenstein while the search continued tom was found by search teams on monday
4148865 the rest of the hertfordshire expedition members and leadership team have now arrived home in the uk
4148866 our thoughts are with toms family at this sad time
4148867 we are all shocked and distressed by the news of toms death and our thoughts are with his parents family and friends at this dreadful time
4148868 tom was a very bright enthusiastic and committed student who was doing very well in his degree with a passion and flair for fieldwork
4148869 he was due to return for his final undergraduate year next month
4148870 all members of the school of environmental sciences staff and students will be deeply saddened by his tragic death
4148871 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
4148872 represents an important step in our five point plan for progress specifically maintaining our financial strength and focusing on our core u s mortgage insurance business
4148873 he would do this while cutting unnecessary spending paying for his proposals and bringing down the budget deficit
4148874 obamanomics is lavish new government spending that must be paid for by new tax increases on a struggling economy
4148875 the undisguised truth is that barack obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just three years hes proposed raising taxes on family savings small businesses energy and social security
4148876 its a reflection of a confused market on some days people want to celebrate the decline in oil prices and on other days theres concern crude is down because of slowing global growth
4148877 technology in particular is benefiting buy technology and sell commodities
4148878 the cpi consumer price index number coming out prior to the open set the tone in that it was more negative than the market was expected that said weve seen a decline in commodity prices and crude is on a downward trend it just helps the economy and helps the consumer
4148879 the weakest sectors of the first half of 2008 have turned into the leaders of the most recent rally
4148880 the most obvious rotation of money has occurred in the commodities arena
4148881 big money has been pulled from the sector as the u s dollar rallies and the global demand story weighs on the future outlook
4148882 the largest net cash inflows occurred into etfs tracking fixed income and leveraged inverse etfs
4148883 inflows slowed for etfs tracking commodities while those tracking large cap u s equities saw the largest outflows
4148884 seem to have preceded the reversal of the short financials long energy trade
4148885 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4148886 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama

4148897 every speech should contain a line saying that you were born in the middle of america to a middle class family in the middle of the last century
4148898 i was born into a middle class family in the middle of the country in the middle of the last century
4148899 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
4148900 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
4148901 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
4148902 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
4148903 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break

4148951 thats true ive seen a number of players at national tournaments who came in baked purely so they could play better in most cases they did although obviously they couldnt just pull out another joint midway through
4148952 in one wcg a player i knew took amphetamines an hour before his match to boost his reflexes his team ended up losing the match although it certainly had an impact his performance helped his team to win one map out of three it kind of hits home that only the really talented will come out on top in the end

4149062 they are obviously one of the hottest teams at the tournament
4149063 even when the score was tied at 9 9 in the second game we didnt feel shaky
4149064 these alarming findings clearly show that a partially open smoking area is still an unsafe environment where people are exposed to harmful levels of secondhand smoke
4149065 the situation is unacceptable and confirms that the 2007 changes to the law did not go far enough to protect patrons or workers
4149066 nsw should effectively separate smoking areas from working including eating spaces

4149072 we will seek independence in strict compliance with international law
4149073 as to our independence as to our progress toward this goal no force will make us stop the goal has been set and we will advance toward this goal together
4149074 there was a little possibility of establishing dialogue before the aggression in south ossetia through mediators through the un secretary general and politicians visited now there will be no dialogues no talks with georgia
4149075 georgia has hammered a huge rusty nail into its integrity
4149076 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport two days ago reports said we had destroyed the airport

4149093 he was playing so well at the end of the season that i think he just picked up from there
4149094 obviously you try to keep getting better but he was just playing at such a high level there i dont see where its a huge jump from that
4149095 the point of all of this is to show the consumer the average person walking through the fair how corn and soybeans are used throughout the country its an educational process and many of them say i didnt realize that for farmers to be able to see where their corn and soybeans are actually going its a big help for them it gives them a grasp on what our groups are doing

4149108 was russias objective a regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of that country
4149109 regime change was an american expression that russia did not use
4149110 i have given a complete response and perhaps the united states representative had not been listening when he had given his response perhaps he had not had his earpiece on
4149111 russian media reported that foreign fighters including americans were found among the dead in tskhinvali americans who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces

4149113 the great challenge of the 1970s and 1980s was economic revival the great challenge in this decade and the next is social revival
4149114 we used to stand for the individual we still do but individual freedoms count for little if society is disintegrating now we stand for the family for the neighborhood in a word for society
4149115 come on people on the path from victims to victors
4149116 championed a freedom focused foreign policy confident of americas moral responsibilities in the world and unafraid to use our military power

4149118 there are of course times when it makes sense to engage in tough diplomacy with hostile governments
4149119 mr obama has said that in proposing this he is following in the footsteps of reagan and jfk but kennedy never met with castro and reagan never met with khomeini and can anyone imagine presidents kennedy or reagan sitting down unconditionally with ahmadinejad or chavez i certainly cannot
4149120 if a president ever embraced our worst enemies in this way he would strengthen them and undermine our most steadfast allies
4149121 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4149122 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4149123 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles

4149126 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future

4149129 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4149130 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4149131 frontrunners jimmy you mean for the past 25 years weve only supported all those winning teams we had all omitted zero of them thats the only time we support our teams oh okay so when like our defending mvp shortstop is having a below par season and is on pace to score about 70 less runs than he did last year we should just unconditionally support him is that what you mean or when that same defending mvp gets benched for not running out fly balls or gets stuck in traffic on his way to a game vs the mets we should just brush it off and cheer you on anyway got it thanks for the tip j roll
4149132 i get it were tough on our players but front runners lets be hard to be a front runner when your squad is one of the all time losing est franchises in sports i wont even get into the flyers attendance during the worst season in franchise history or how tough it is to get a seat at the linc to watch an 8 8 team drawing a blank on any comparable sixers reference

4149140 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4149141 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4149142 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4149170 due to the process of learning which they have gone through these two minded lds often no longer accept the church as the only true one with the only true priesthood authority and the only valid sacred ordinances but they see it as a christian church in which good inspired programs are found as well as failure and error
4149171 since the social relationships between them and other ward or stake members suffer avoidance silence even mobbing because of their status as heretics which is usually known via gossip and since the extent of active involvement and range of possible callings are reduced because of their nonconformity in various areas there is a risk that they end up leaving the church after all because they are simply ignored by the majority of the other members
4149172 it is necessary that the church not only shows more support and openness to these apostates but also teaches and advises all members bishops stake presidents etc who usually dont know how to deal with such a situation in terms of organizational and ecclesiastical questions and out of insecurity fail to treat the critical member with the necessary love and respect that even a normal stranger would receive

4149176 we had a hunch that what mattered was not the number of social interactions nor the degree to which other people provided practical benefit but the degree to which social interactions satisfied an individuals specific subjective need for connection

4149198 this is the first time a judge has stood up for him
4149199 there was never a dispute about travel restrictions and a tether as a condition of bond for our two felony charges
4149200 in the preceding days he worked his regularly scheduled shifts without incident
4149201 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4149202 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4149203 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4149204 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4149205 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible

4149207 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4149208 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4149209 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney

4149222 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not
4149223 we are just watching the situation there are still snipers out there certain groups have gotten through and the provocations are continuing

4149225 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4149226 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4149233 lincoln was the first president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus halted our system of checks and balances protections under the bill of rights and due process lincoln also opposed a womens right to vote
4149234 he campaigned to support the preservation of slavery in the southern states his bid to offer freedom to the slaves was but an afterthought more then a year after the civil war began

4149239 the abkhaz would begin as now the long prepared operation to cleanse the upper part of the kodori gorge
4149240 in principle moscow was even prepared to formally preserve the territorial integrity of georgia in the form of some kind of confederation
4149241 one must not forever hold the forces and fleet at a high level of readiness 24 hours a day

4149297 ich habe nie jene dramatik bei der einsch tzung der eu durch die sterreicher gesehen die manche behauptet und mit der sie zuletzt ganz massiv auf negative weise politik gemacht haben die sterreicher sind anspruchsvolle selbstbewusste und kritische eu b rger aber sie lassen sich weder von einer regierungspartei noch von einem zeitungsherausgeber ins eck der entrechteten und entt uschten unter einer eu diktatur dr ngen

4149314 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
4149315 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
4149316 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
4149317 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that

4149330 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4149331 we did see that there was potential for a conflagration in the region but georgia is a friendly state its supported by the u s and so it was difficult to refuse
4149332 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4149333 because if there is stability we can fight terrorism if we have a strong economy we can fight terrorism and we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
4149334 pakistan is passing through a difficult phase we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4149335 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples co operation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs

4149339 american intelligence agencies have concluded that members of pakistans powerful spy service helped plan the deadly july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan according to united states government officials
4149340 the conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack the officials said providing the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas

4149342 the pentagon says no civilians were killed in an air strike sunday in a remote area of eastern afghanistan which local officials say killed 27 people who were walking to a wedding
4149343 i can only tell you i talked to afghanistan this morning and they are very clear with that particular strike that they believe they struck the intended target and that there were not innocent civilians involved in that particular strike
4149344 the attack left bullet holes in two of the convoy vehicles and a weapon was found in the car

4149401 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4149402 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4149403 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4149404 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4149405 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4149406 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4149407 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4149408 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4149409 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4149410 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4149411 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content

4149417 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4149418 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4149419 the prime ministers stance is that the establishment of a palestinian state is meant to provide an answer to the absorption of palestinian refugees those refugees who are not returned to a palestinian state will be dealt with by an international force
4149420 the american stance on this matter is identical to the israeli stance as expressed in u s president george bushs april 2004 letter in which he says palestinian refugees will not be returned to the state of israel but to a future palestinian state

4149427 brandon roy is having surgery its not an uncommon procedure hes going to take a while to recover probably between six weeks and three months there is no reason to assume at this point that it will be any more serious than that we will know more as soon as the surgery has been completed which should be today thats it no more no less now lets talk about the ramifications a little as our source reminded us we are still 80 some days away from the start of the season at the short end of the recovery time would be back well before the season started hed probably be back before training camp even at the long end of the recovery scale would miss the first couple weeks of the season stretching it out to avoid making him take a long road trip first thing hed probably miss 11 games out of 82 the latter would be disappointing but hardly a fatal blow to our season
4149428 first im going to call him a defensive version of steve nash its interesting to me that scouting reports of rubio almost always question his lateral quickness and his athletic ability as a whole yet he manages to be everywhere defensively the thing that springs to mind in comparison is how nash might not be the quickest pg though i think his athleticism is underrated yet hes just so damn quick and efficient with the ball its probably one part superior basketball iq one part being underestimated one part knowing the angles who knows though rubio is certainly gifted with excellent height 6 4 and length 6 9 wingspan for the pg position as well as i mentioned rubios defense is way ahead of his offense right now and he has a long way to go in terms of becoming a scoring threat but his poise basketball iq court vision and flair are already evident
4149429 talent wise the bucks would clearly get the short end of the stick but then again the questions about mo have never been related to talent clearly the bucks view this as addition by subtraction though that might be tougher to sell to the average fan the bucks will get some financial benefits over the next two years and then even more flexibility once ridnours deal is up in 2010 but the near term benefits wont be the same as they would have gotten in a straight salary dump that suggests hammond and skiles do see ridnour as more than just cap relief though its not clear what the point guard pecking order will look like once the dust settles as for mo he could be a terrific fit next to lebron in cleveland where hell also be surrounded by a more defensive starting lineup than in milwaukee
4149430 todays acquisition of desmond mason and joe smith will add more experience depth and quite possibly wins to the team this season having covered mason during the two years the hornets were i can say without a doubt oklahoma city just became 10 times more competitive of masons two seasons with the hornets one stretch during the 2006 07 season defined what hes all about with the hornets playing without injured key cogs chris paul peja stojakovic david west and bobby jackson from late december to mid january mason stepped up and became the teams go to guy in one 11 game stretch over that span he averaged 17 7 points 6 3 rebounds and 40 4 minutes
4149431 statistically williams in 2007 08 had his best 3 point shooting season was deadly at the foul line which is needed here in the final minutes and had over a 2 to 1 assists turnovers ratio he also has the mid range jumper that the estimable smith provided scouts say williams needs the ball to be effective the oddity is that james a great player has never found his second banana the fault is not all in the sidekicks james is going to have to post up and play off the ball more
4149432 getting back to actual trade analysis the potential problem with this deal is coach mike considering he has the most dangerous offensive basketball weapon in the world and has no idea how to use him were not sure adding an offensive specialist in mo williams is going to do anything at all will he even put up with him considering hes not exactly known as a defense loving player hopefully this was just the bi product of being in milwaukee but that still doesnt address the coach mike thing we have no idea how this will go but well recommend the same thing weve recommended for like 3 or 4 years now post up lebron more and hire an offensive coordinator
4149433 obviously though ferrys main priority is still to win a championship this season sure its sounds all rosy that the cavs added a good player while not giving up too much but thats not what matters right now right now what cavaliers fans want to know is did this move improve the cavaliers chances of winning the nba championship this season the answer to that question is a resounding yes how couldnt it the cavaliers biggest area that they needed help in was scoring can you believe that since lebron has been with the cavaliers no player other than lebron himself has scored more than 17 ppg and only one ilgauskas has averaged more than 16 ppg once mo williams has averaged over 17 ppg in each of the last two seasons by that merit alone mo williams is going to be an enormous asset to lebron and the rest of the cavaliers and will make them a more formidable playoff opponent

4149483 the fast expanding developing economies of india and china where coal remains a major fuel source for more than two billion people have long been regarded as among the biggest challenges to reducing carbon emissions but the return now to coal even in eco conscious europe is sowing real alarm among environmentalists who warn that it is setting the world on a disastrous trajectory that will make controlling global warming impossible
4149484 in fact the technology that the industry is counting on to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that add to global warning carbon capture and storage is not now commercially available no one knows if it is feasible on a large cost effective scale
4149485 many have likened carbon captures road from the demonstration lab to a safe cheap available reality as a challenge equivalent to putting a man on the moon

4149556 look the president and the vice president have always polled strongly within the party and calvert is one of those who has been a supporter of the administration and pursuing policies that the good for orange county and his constituents
4149557 they are continuing to pursue policies that they believe are correct regardless of popularity
4149558 we had eight years of a president whose first meeting every day was with a pollster clinton was driven by the polls everything he did was couched by how itd affect him in the polls

4149565 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4149566 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4149567 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4149568 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more
4149569 with plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
4149570 nicotine causes the tiny blood vessels in the skin to clamp down or constrict which reduces blood supply to the skin
4149571 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
4149572 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery
4149573 why invest so much money in a cosmetic procedure for enhancement if the patient will not participate and do his or her part to help ensure the best outcome possible
4149574 there used to be this understanding that if youre getting treatment youre supposed to be in your bed
4149575 i started in 1992 and that was really a time when not as many patients were exercising
4149576 if a patient came to me back then and asked about exercise i would have said there wasnt really any information

4149599 buscamos a liberdade total com qualquer tipo de instrumento a nossa inten o foi a de realizar um disco como se fazia antigamente direto sem grandes manipula es nos computadores e na mesa depois de gravar
4149600 esses cinco anos sem lan ar trabalhos in ditos na verdade passaram muito r pido porque n o paramos de trabalhar e tamb m encaramos o ac stico como um disco autoral n o sentamos em banquinho fizemos tudo diferente

4149602 muito bacana lan ar um disco e em seguida estampar na camiseta a marca da turn os grandes artistas do mundo fazem isso e o brasil n o um lugar menor montar uma agenda com anteced ncia para que o cara saiba que daqui a dois ou tr s meses a banda vai passar pela cidade dele muito importante ainda que no brasil seja complicado porque aquele v o que voc iria pegar muitas vezes foi cancelado
4149603 a gente continua acreditando neste pa s o santo t cansado mas ele d a volta por cima somos brasileiros antes de mais nada e quanto mais a gente acredita que acabou mais o brasil se mostra revelador
4149604 como n s gravamos o disco de forma org nica ao inv s de uma imagem manipulada no computador quer amos uma fotografia e o dedo para baixo clama pelo desarmamento paz contra essa viol ncia desenfreada no rio que sempre uma tribuna para se aparecer

4149617 i know this i said with jameel mcclain a year ago you cant just have that guy out there 85 90 snaps a game
4149618 now weve just got to find what is that role going to be is it going to be 40 snaps twenty snaps ten snaps i cant tell you right now but i know he is going to have a role for us and i think its going to be fairly significant

4149620 we do not see any significant changes in the general spending patterns of our customers or prospects
4149621 while there is broad concern about the global economic environment most enterprises continue to invest in their infrastructure to improve operating efficiency
4149622 weve also seen some improvements in our top u s accounts
4149623 in fact i see more in accounts that were actively participating in particularly our big accounts including a lot of them in new york city
4149624 we view server virtualization as a key theme and driver for netapp in the coming years
4149625 netapps strength in nas and iscsi protocols has received a higher adoption rate in virtualized environments than we initially expected
4149626 the company is executing well growing at more than two times the market growth rate
4149627 the growth rate expectations may a little high netapps biggest competition is emc and they also have good products and are executing well ntaps second biggest headache is hp which is also executing well
4149628 we are a little concerned if netapp can grow more than two times the market rate by gaining share over its competitors
4149629 we believe that the risks are higher now we are maintaining our buy rating although we believe that revenue and eps expectations for fy2009 may be a little too optimistic
4149630 dont read into that that we have a particular acquisition in mind or that we have any particular change in terms of stock repurchase

4149642 no more newpapers i can get everything i need from this
4149643 ultimately they will breed in people the idea that news shouldnt cost anything even that news is cheap but in fact news done well and properly requires investment and money free newspapers by their nature are light on journalistic resources
4149644 they will no doubt tell us what happened but news should tell us how and why things happen i fear that approach will be lost

4149672 i know you must travel light but these four packets are very very important you must carry them and you mustnt drink this tea
4149673 i would like you to carry one to our premier one to the president of france one to the prime minister of england and one to the president of the united states of america and i want you to take our message from this factory that if ever they get a mad thought of pushing the nuclear button to please stop for one minute and have a fresh cup of tea from these packets and then they will have a moment to think and contemplate and they will realize that the people who are producing tea working in the factories working in the fields working in normal life leading an ordinary life are not their enemies we are ordinary people and we have done nothing to deserve nuclear attack

4149681 if we got it published it would be a great tribute
4149682 i was surrounded by a ton of talented people at the globe it saddens me to see the talent and institutional memory that has been lost a story repeated throughout our industry its absurd to think they dont have plenty of good people left but equally absurd to think that they can absorb the hits theyve taken without feeling the impact
4149683 ive never accepted the premise that people dont read game stories i think theyll still read a gamer written with style and information they cant glean elsewhere like the series gamer i wrote last october about what led to papelbon picking off matt holliday that gave me great satisfaction to have something no one else had among 500 or so other reporters at the series

4149688 hed say a fan from visalia just caught that one
4149689 people would actually call up and ask how did skip know
4149690 probably will go down as one of the biggest outs of my career
4149691 if you were advancing us you would have said the same thing that pap is 1 8 seconds to the plate and he doesnt pick
4149692 but it was a different situation in the game against the angels we didnt care if he stole because we had confidence in paps getting the hitter and we didnt want to take anything away from him to try to get the runner on that situation
4149693 we know theyre advancing us theyre watching it that night i was talking to pap in the shower about that exact thing and about what was to come bullpen coach gary tuck was talking to him about it pitching coach john farrell talked to him about it about different things we were going to do
4149694 you put all those things together and it comes up hey were going to pick once to see where hes at and then were going to slide step
4149695 and we were watching i got a big lump in my throat because he kept inching inching inching off and pap did a great job of holding the ball letting him get off there and then im sitting there with a lump in my throat hoping he doesnt throw it away
4149696 there are a lot of times we dont want him to throw over
4149697 but in this situation with helton and garrett atkins coming up we couldnt afford it and it just happened to work out
4149698 since i was 8 years old ive hoped and dreamed that one day id be able to get one
4149699 the last text i had from him said one more walk and then i will have done everything i wanted to do
4149700 it was the sort of thing he absolutely loved to do
4149701 we know right up until a minute or so before he died he was probably at his absolute happiest
4149702 we feel that those last two weeks of his life were probably absolutely fantastic and he was really happy
4149703 they explained that he had not turned up at the rendezvous to get the train back
4149704 at that point i knew my son was dead i just knew
4149705 he had fallen from a huge height it looks as if he probably died straight away thats some sort of comfort to us in some way
4149706 our biggest fear was that he was lying there wondering why nobody had come to find him
4149707 we dont feel theres anybody to blame except that perhaps tom made some sort of mistake it was just a dreadful dreadful accident
4149708 he was absolutely outgoing he was always looking for a challenge he achieved everything he wanted to achieve
4149709 tom would do anything for anybody he was one of those people who would talk to anybody he was a really great kid
4149710 he was passionate about green issues and stood for the green party in the local elections in may he ultimately wanted to be an mp for the green party
4149711 he had already booked to go to russia and mongolia next year on a scouts project to help street urchins
4149712 a huge part of toms life was scouting and his life would not have been what it was without the scouts
4149713 were finding it very hard to accept that we will never see him again its going to take a very very long time
4149714 toms close relatives were informed of his disappearance on saturday afternoon they flew to liechtenstein while the search continued tom was found by search teams on monday
4149715 the rest of the hertfordshire expedition members and leadership team have now arrived home in the uk
4149716 our thoughts are with toms family at this sad time
4149717 we are all shocked and distressed by the news of toms death and our thoughts are with his parents family and friends at this dreadful time
4149718 tom was a very bright enthusiastic and committed student who was doing very well in his degree with a passion and flair for fieldwork
4149719 he was due to return for his final undergraduate year next month
4149720 all members of the school of environmental sciences staff and students will be deeply saddened by his tragic death

4149726 we just missed out on europe last season and thats what we will be looking to do this year
4149727 we obviously dont want to say too much but well be looking to push on and get back into europe
4149728 but the important thing to remember is that we are relatively still a small club in terms of fan base and our limited resources
4149729 i always feel that over the last four or five seasons under mark hughes that weve punched above our weight
4149730 weve overachieved as a club whether its in the transfer market or with our league position
4149731 what we must do now and im sure we will is keep progressing and move forward
4149732 i hate to dwell on the past but mark hughes and his team did a tremendous job for the club
4149733 but we have moved on now the new manager has come in and straight from the word go hes been really good and really positive
4149734 he doesnt want to stand still he wants to move on and progress the club
4149735 im sure if hes thinking that the players are no different
4149736 our deep dark secret is that taking care of fish makes us a lot of money
4149737 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years

4149847 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels

4149849 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4149905 one can quibble with some of the details but at end of the day the difference between them will get washed out by negotiations between the next president and the congress
4149906 as president i will not shirk the mantle of leadership the u s bears
4149907 i will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges i will not accept the same dead end of failed diplomacy that failed kyoto

4149957 our bass player was mattys roommate and thats how matty got involved with helping us book this band he brought to our aid
4149958 dont worry she likes that kinda shit hell i just fucked her with a clawhammer
4149959 so me and jesus christ put this band together and we had like i said mattys roommate on bass a guy we called twinkies on drums his father had been a famous jazz bass player a jewish guy and his mother had been a black addict prostitute both of whom had died by the time i met twinkies his dad of alcoholism and his mother of a rare disease one of the best god damn alto players of my time in new york ill call him little richie rich and a big tall
4149960 and robin rothman was joey ramones girlfriend at that time though i didnt know that at that time and besides i wasnt really that big a fan of the ramones though hell i liked em and matty was always playing them full blast on his stereo and i once sat in mattys apartment with the artist ratso rizzo another old pal of these brooklyn boyz and mattys roommate and a couplea strange chicks and robin rothman and robin suddenly said

4149963 dan lynch was a seedy bar full of dedicated winos and was surely an official halfway house for bellevue rejects and outright crazies with a constantly active pool table in the back a long bar at which sat the bars loyal creatures of habit a long line that included a ribald but totally scummy looking oddball in a wheelchair who kept toasting the band as we played by throwing back steins of lager and then we bought him several steins of lager and the more we played the more steins of lager he threw back
