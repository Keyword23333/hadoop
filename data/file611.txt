6110033 independence is impossible we ukraine russia belarus all are dependent on each other and will reunite again sooner or later
6110034 certainly i wish prosperity for ukraine certainly i would love to see its progressive development but we can not ignore the presence of russia we used to be one big family and still depend on each other my children live in russia and i can not say i am happy to be independent from a country where my family is
6110035 the essence of ukrainian independence lies in its tolerance towards other nations and human rights it is amazing how ukraine has changed in past 10 years i feel the country is on the right track and becomes a better place to be with every moment
6110036 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict

6110057 even more than that when ukrtelecom receives an application for network connection from a private internet service provider they start asking who are the clients and then go to them and offer their services so this is one of the ways how they get a big portion of their clients which helps them to hold the position of being the largest internet service provider in ukraine its as simple as that

6110421 what the students experience should be the same as it has been in the past
6110422 its really good to be back to be honest its been a bit of a long summer
6110423 i had quite a few options and i spoke to a few people but in my heart of hearts i always wanted to come back to carlisle
6110424 this is the best move for me i was more than happy to sign and i just cant wait to get going again

6110429 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
6110430 your matter cannot be taken to court because there is no witness to testify and no evidence of proof if you want this matter to move from this stage come with your witness or exhibit to substantiate your claim that you were indeed beaten
6110431 officer the foolish boy is presently in his house and we need to go there now and arrest him please officer help me so that he wont escape my sister is in severe pain
6110432 we are going to enter the report and then you will be given police medical report slip which you will take to any medical doctor at the hospital who will examine you write the report of findings and then you come back with the slip to the police officer who is investigating the matter the said police will obtain statement from you and thereafter you will be required to come with your witness and after they too must have made their statements then we will go ahead to invite the suspect
6110433 i was beaten by one boy he kicked me in the stomach and also hit me on my spinal cord
6110434 what type of question is that i have done what you wanted for your matter to be prosecuted at the police all you need to do is to take the report to the police
6110435 what type of examination is this or the doctor is just interested in collecting the money
6110436 we once met one of the doctors at the bar to examine my friend who was assaulted by his elder brother and without delay he endorsed the report the doctor asked my friend what happened and after he had explained the doctor quickly removed his pen from his chest pocket and wrote the report i was also confused as to what the doctor wrote specifically since he did not use any device to examine the patient
6110437 the issue of medical report has always been a problem we cannot investigate assault cases without medical reports but when we give some complainants medical report papers to be endorsed by medical doctors they hardly come back to continue their matters mostly on the grounds that they do not have money to pay the doctors so the investigation always ends there we really want this problem to be solved by providing police doctors at every police headquarters
6110438 this is really frustrating our operation sometimes we have to help them especially in severe cases
6110439 i reported my husband for beating me mercilessly the police gave me a medical paper to be endorsed by a doctor unfortunately i did not meet up the charges of the doctor so i have to come back to inform the police about it since i have no money to pay the doctor
6110440 every medical doctor collects the money so that it can be used on transportation fare when needed to defend the report in the court
6110441 it is thrilling comprehensive literate meticulously researched and scientifically accurate it is one of the best books ever written about the history and significance of a natural disaster
6110442 in my travels round the world i have always been surprised that no matter where i go people recognize and know me from europe australia and india to the philippines and the zulu nation in south africa
6110443 this got me thinking i realized that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me so i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me
6110444 adventures of my life that no one else gets to see

6110448 the challenge is to correctly identify the causes of low school enrolment and collectively design appropriate solutions to them especially at nursery primary and secondary levels
6110449 the solution to this challenge must be anchored upon the constitutional provision which guarantees rights to education
6110450 we are a company with heart and it is so important for us to be involved in our communities and to support organizations that help make our communities

6110453 the grevys zebra and mountain zebra are on the endangered list and both are threatened by habitat loss we hope that the addition of the plush zebra at build a bear workshop r stores will help raise awareness of the zebra and inspire people to help

6110513 the capabilities approach religious practices and the importance of recognition
6110514 when can ever be justified in banning a religious practice this paper focusses on martha nussbaums capabilities approach certain religious practices create a clash between capabilities where the capability to religious belief and expression is in conflict with the capability of equal status and nondiscrimination one example of such a clash is the case of polygamy nussbaum argues that there may be circumstances where polygamy may be acceptable on the contrary i argue that the capabilities approach cannot justify polygamy in any circumstance her approach rules out polygamy but may not rule out all non monogamous relationships such as polyamory finally i conclude that the capabilities approach would benefit from a more robust understanding of recognition

6110649 over time this acquisition could improve salesforce coms competitiveness in this area

6110747 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6110748 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6110749 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose

6110829 are you going to tell me what you want or is some truffling pig going to find your body in a few weeks
6110830 ripley is our anti hero hero because he speaks to our darkest resentments needs urges and capabilities
6110831 on some darker level most of us actually identify with him
6110832 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6110833 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families and now as people prepare for the winter they are going to be hit with higher costs for home heating oil it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6110834 for three decades as our energy crisis grew decision making in washington has been rigged against our national interests and the interests of american consumers and for almost that long senator mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need when a critical proposal came before the senate late last year that would have provided tax incentives for the development of alternative energy by revoking 13 billion in giveaways to the oil companies he was the only senator who didnt vote and we came up one vote short and now hes standing with the oil companies in opposing a bipartisan compromise in congress that would expand offshore drilling and at the same time make serious investments in alternative energy to break our dependence on foreign oil when it comes to solving our energy problems john mccain is just more of the same and america cant afford it
6110835 mccain continues to reject bipartisan compromise because it would roll back massive tax breaks for the oil companies
6110836 that is not putting the country first it is putting the interest of oil companies first
6110837 one of the most important things in show business is who you know
6110838 no es de extra ar si lleva casi dos semanas sin comer abandonado a su suerte en la gasolinera
6110839 parece un animal fuerte seguro que en unos pocos d as estar recuperado
6110840 el humano con el que yo viv a era mi amigo y nunca me har a eso
6110841 lo que pasa es que est un poco cansado del trabajo y se olvido de mi en aquel sitio y ahora seguro que est tratando de encontrarme para llevarme con l
6110842 es que yo no quiero que nadie me adopte yo ya tengo una familia y no quiero otra
6110843 no creo que pueda recuperarse de estas heridas y aunque lo haga se acabar muriendo de tristeza
6110844 desde que lleg pr cticamente no ha comido se pasa el d a tumbado en la esquina de la entrada como si estuviera esperando por alguien que tu y yo sabemos que no vendr
6110845 sabes que estamos desbordados no podemos atenderlo como realmente se merece as que no vale la pena seguir haci ndolo sufrir lo mejor para l es dormirlo
6110846 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
6110847 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california
6110848 le pas una mano por debajo del pantal n para tocarle la cola
6110849 la salud p blica es uno de los pilares fundamentales de las pol ticas municipales desde 1989 y sabemos que la atenci n de nuestros hospitales ha trascendido los l mites de la ciudad convirti ndose en un ejemplo de solidaridad social es la municipalidad con su presupuesto quien se hace cargo del sistema y el porcentaje de ste destinado a salud ha ido in crescendo en los ltimos a os
6110850 adem s agreg es reconocida la crisis financiera que atraviesa el municipio que lo ha llevado a realizar aumentos en distintas herramientas de recaudaci n como el drei y la tgi a recortar horas extras a no renovar contratos y a disminuir las obras p blicas proyectadas para este a o por ello creemos que la municipalidad debe gestionar m s fuentes de financiamiento para el sistema de salud que recordemos es el nico en la provincia que se solventa solo
6110851 la propuesta es que el ejecutivo elabore en acuerdo con el gobierno provincial un programa espec fico para la ciudad con el objeto de coadyuvar en el sostenimiento econ mico del sistema de salud municipal
6110852 este proyecto posibilitar a en un plazo no mayor a tres per odos la absorci n por parte del estado provincial de la inversi n en salud a cargo de la municipalidad de rosario a excepci n de aquella que corresponda a la atenci n primaria
6110853 esto posibilitar a que los dos estados en un marco de solidaridad contributiva sostengan la inversi n creciente en el sistema de salud p blica local los desembolsos que efectivizar a la provincia podr an consistir en subsidios mensuales equivalentes a la ejecuci n presupuestaria que por el mismo per odo registre el municipio de rosario en materia de salud
6110854 oh dear from where did you get this gorgeous arse
6110855 this is the baby snack my son loves pumpkin flavor
6110856 you are beautiful you are like a goddess when you dance
6110857 its just this whole day valentines day its like an evil conspiracy created by the greeting card people and the flower people and the candy people well not the candy people they do gods work
6110858 i have a pro life record and our administration will have pro life policies
6110859 we are barring entry to paul francis gadd and will be deporting him to his home country england unconditionally and even if he does not wish to board the plane
6110860 we are now waiting to return him to england as soon as possible
6110861 now we are talking and he seems to be in a great mood laughing and enjoy ing chatting with our negotiators
6110862 its kind of breaking the ice first before asking him to change his mind
6110863 i didnt know id like him as much as i have
6110864 its interesting to watch him create an arc to the show theres musical integrity there im impressed that anyone at any age can be so consistent i wish i was as consistent
6110865 i cant even compare it to any football fields ive been to
6110866 i wanted so badly to get to the next round but the race was slow i felt all right but couldnt close with those guys
6110867 but big bank xyz is selling the money merge program to its customers it must be good
6110868 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable that is why we would like to introduce ourselves today and let the security research community know how they can reach out and work with us
6110869 i tried going online a few times but everybodys grammar is really bad its depressing
6110870 is a heroically scaled representation of a manacled slave created at an important historical juncture in the history of the abolitionist movement in great britain
6110871 the captive slave is a deeply compelling and historically significant painting
6110872 simpson an artist known primarily as a portrait painter fully immersed in the official royal academy took a great professional risk in creating a work that expressed his deeply held anti slavery beliefs
6110873 sempre di qualsiasi cosa dici che c dietro una ragione primordiale legata alla sopravvivenza della specie
6110874 s anche quando siamo convinti di appartenere a una specie eletta che a differenza di tutte le altre ha tagliato i legami con le sue origini quasi tutto quello che facciamo legato alla sopravvivenza e alla continuazione
6110875 prendi la scelta di un partner tu credi di seguire unicamente i tuoi gusti e il tuo carattere e la tua sensibilit peculiare trovi uno che ti piace sei convinta di essere perfettamente padrona della tua scelta invece sotto la tua scelta lavorano criteri legati alla sopravvivenza della specie
6110876 ragioni molto concrete che ti fanno preferire uno tra tanti come partner riproduttivo
6110877 s invece sono meccanismi talmente certi che vengono usati a freddo dalla pubblicit per vendere alla gente qualsiasi cosa
6110878 io non ci credo nessuno sceglie una persona solo in base alla sopravvivenza della specie oggi
6110879 non ho detto solo ma un fattore determinante nella scelta prova e pensarci ti mai piaciuto uno con la fronte bassa uno che parla in modo incomprensibile uno che non sa niente di niente uno che puzza o che non ti guardi mai negli occhi
6110880 no ma cosa centra questione di gusti uno ti sembra bello o brutto o simpatico o antipatico a seconda di come sei tu
6110881 e cosa credi che ci sia dietro il bello e il brutto e il simpatico e lantipatico ci sono i caratteri di un partner riproduttivo desiderabile oppure no di uno con cui potresti fare dei figli con discrete prospettive di vederli sopravvivere oppure no
6110882 s ci sono alcune persone orrende che riescono ad attrarre una quantit di partner riproduttivi perch sembrano offrire alte probabilit di sopravvivenza
6110883 tipo qualunque abominevole uomo ricco e di potere lo vedi e pensi che dovrebbe suscitare lo stesso genere di disgusto in qualunque donna invece non cos perch i suoi segni di preminenza sono cos forti da farlo diventare molto appetibile mettono in ombra qualunque dato negativo perfino che abbia la fronte bassa e puzzi e non ti guardi negli occhi o che sia grasso bavoso e vecchio quello che conta sono le caratteristiche che gli hanno permesso di diventare preminente
6110884 e un uomo cosa cerca in una donna in base alle pure ragioni della sopravvivenza della specie
6110885 cerca anche lui una buona partner riproduttiva in grado di dare alte probabilit di sopravvivenza ai figli e di trasmettergli buone caratteristiche genetiche
6110886 s sembra una cosa proprio brutta ma un dato di fatto pensa alle donne che sono state rappresentate nelle statue e nei quadri attraverso i secoli sono tutte modelli ideali dal punto di vista riproduttivo come se chi dipingeva o scolpiva avesse avuto bisogno di fissare le caratteristiche di un esemplare femminile ideale per ricordarsi quali erano i tratti desiderabili e ricordarli agli altri
6110887 nello stesso modo in cui uno potrebbe appendere al muro il disegno di una mucca ideale
6110888 s ma le statue e i quadri che rappresentano uomini rispondono agli stessi criteri sono tutte fissazioni di requisiti in una forma idealizzata
6110889 allora come spieghi il fatto che possa piacermi uno che mi fa ridere per esempio a cosa serve da un punto di vista di sopravvivenza della specie
6110890 beh non credo che ti piaccia uno che ti fa solo ridere no un buffone
6110891 se spiritoso deve essere anche percettivo in grado di cogliere le cose ed elaborarle in modo rapido secondo unangolazione deve essere uno intelligente e con riflessi pronti dunque uno che ti offre buone possibilit di sopravvivenza lo vedi
6110892 questo sotto poi sopra ci sono molte altre cose trasformazioni culturali influssi climatici o ambientali nelle diverse regioni del mondo sovrapposizioni di messaggi
6110893 tipo la pubblicit e la moda e la cultura di superficie che invece di partner riproduttivi ideali rappresentati in mille varianti in storia dellarte vendono mille varianti di anoressiche troppo alte e troppo magre che sarebbero partner catastrofiche dal punto di vista della specie e le diffondono con una tale intensit e capillarit da imporle agli uomini come modelli desiderabili anche se non corrispondono affatto ai loro istinti profondi
6110894 le donne si riempiono di scontentezza e di complessi per come sono senza neanche rendersi conto che le immagini con cui devono confrontarsi di continuo sono create e messe in giro da uomini a cui le donne non interessano affatto
6110895 in compenso alle donne vengono venduti modelli di uomini cos inconsistenti e narcisi e imbecilli che nella prima situazione davvero difficile le lascerebbero morire senza pensarci un istante ma per fortuna in tutta questa sovrapposizione di segnali ci sono anche persone che riescono a non farsi plasmare dalla pubblicit e ad andare oltre la semplice compulsione a sopravvivere e ad affacciarsi su altri territori
6110896 gli spazi del non tangibile del non pesabile non misurabile non cronometrabile del non dicibile anche
6110897 dove non conta pi la sopravvivenza e non conta pi neanche la specie il che rende le loro attrazioni molto ricche e molto complicate
6110898 this pricing change significantly reduces the upfront cost of listing fixed price items on ebay and bases fees primarily on the successful sale of items
6110899 the indian search market is dominated by global internet brands with google attracting the wide majority of searches
6110900 as the top local player in the search market indian web portal rediff com attracts slightly less than 2 percent of all searches indicating that there is substantial room for growth among the local internet brands
6110901 facilitate useful connections improve information flow influence better ideas distribute work disseminate excellence and help distill any wisdom that might exist in a crowd
6110902 nowhere near the disaster some of the blood thirsty scavengers in this business were predicting
6110903 testified yesterday in federal court that she was disappointed and dismayed when an official at the library of congress rescinded a job offer even though she was the star candidate
6110904 after a long and sleepless night i have determined you are not a good fit and not what we want
6110905 before it was just an occasional hobby that id pull out and fiddle with from time to time i was just too busy launching a career
6110906 fourfourfour was the only canadian producer i could find with expertise in games
6110907 and theyve been absolutely fantastic they produced a small press run locally and if we get enough orders they can coordinate a larger run in china
6110908 it only took them a month or so to get a deal with home hardware
6110909 one of the markets we want to hit with this game is rural farming communities especially in western canada and they knew exactly how to do it
6110910 its like writing fiction existing board game publishers are inundated with submissions most of which arent commercially viable
6110911 thats probably because people tend to think of farming as boring but for those who are interested in the theme we think this is the one game to own its fun realistic challenging and very carefully tested
6110912 the early versions worked but took too long and werent fun enough i wasnt sold that i had a marketable product until my nephew who was one of my play testers brought a prototype to a family reunion when things got slow it was played almost straight through for the next day and a half while a stack of popular published games was completely ignored
6110913 una manifestaci n m s de la voluntad extrasistema que la ley impugnada pretende consagrar
6110914 o bien la m xima ignorancia de los mecanismos m s elementales del estado de derecho que no es presumible en quienes sostienen a un gobierno democr tico o bien la confusi n absoluta entre los partidos y los rganos de gobiernos por ellos gestionados
6110915 constantes referencias a la jurisprudencia europea y constitucional a una eventual ley singular y a la eventual afectaci n de minor as
6110916 puede ser encarnado por los partidos pol ticos en atenci n a las cualidades de las que se encuentran investidos
6110917 un instrumento capital del pluralismo no son rganos del estado
6110918 no genera situaci n alguna de indefensi n en la defensa de los intereses de los ciudadanos que afirman representar
6110919 los partidos pol ticos no son representantes pol ticos de los ciudadanos
6110920 la representaci n pol tica recae sobre las concretas personas incluidas en las candidaturas que tras las correspondientes operaciones electorales resultan elegidas
6110921 el derecho a defender sus argumentos a favor de la opci n de la consulta
6110922 whether they would be good enough for transfusion is very unclear
6110923 it seems like the choice is between not good and worse
6110924 somehow ive been very lucky that after each book the next idea just comes popping along
6110925 but im 88 so theyll have to stop sooner or later
6110926 this is an interesting merger in that the new company will be a supplier to all the big mobile companies except motorola
6110927 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies
6110928 here they ericsson are in an instant creating a business with a critical mass and a market leading position within mobile platforms and at the same time focusing on the core operations
6110929 this type of streamlining is of course positive and i dont think we should rule out that we will see more of this
6110930 chi meglio di me in formula 1 solo alonso e raikkonen
6110931 we have spoken with other vets in our acquaintance and they likewise had never encountered anything like this
6110932 we began to realise that we had something very special as a result he has been an indoor cat and has a chip installed in case he gets lost
6110933 yoda is so different that we were concerned that he might be catnapped
6110934 for those not familiar with the book it inspires you to be part of the
6110935 nothing bothers me more than sloth the objective is to fix mistakes of ambition and not make mistakes of sloth i work my ass off
6110936 im just taking everything step by step enjoying the ride
6110937 i really want to spend as much time with my friends and family as i can
6110938 its coming up on two months on the road i want to be able to see them and just relax
6110939 well my careers over lets toast all downhill from here
6110940 my friends in the car business so hes going to help me
6110941 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6110942 it kind of bugs me im always getting rocked i need to get my video game skills up thats for sure
6110943 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6110944 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6110945 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6110946 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6110947 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6110948 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6110949 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6110950 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6110951 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6110952 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6110953 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us

6110957 sushil kumar deserves the highest accolades for his achievement this is also the time for the government to consider an honour like bharat ratna for khashaba dadasaheb jadhav who had bagged indias first individual olympic bronze medal way back in 1952
6110958 as per the pay scales then my fathers last salary was rs 1 783 nearly 45 per month all his other dues including provident fund came to rs 75 000 which he invested to lay water pipeline in our ancestral farms
6110959 our financial condition was so bad that an amount of rs 5 000 unspent on the house had to be utilized for his final rites
6110960 there was no sponsorship no official help villagers helped with small individual contributions there was no professional coaching or a diet regimen they lived and travelled under pathetic conditions communications were poor this is the right time for the government to consider a major honour for k d jadhav
6110961 unfortunately our wrestlers only aim for the maharashtra kesri award
6110962 rustom e hind the countrys top award in this sport the commonwealth or olympics are too distant for them
6110963 dont wait for them to die in penury or honour them posthumously
6110964 it is a great achievement for sushil he is the new icon for delhi and i will give him a cash award of rs 5 million if he doesnt have a job i will provide him with one and if he has one he will get an out of turn promotion his coach satpal will also get promotion
6110965 here later today with lileks lgfs charles johnson and much more vodkapundit on amazon

6110970 i told him they dont have to be christian but they do need to be good programmers
6110971 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6110972 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6110973 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

6110975 to get 1 of 4 of the states active democrats i feel very good about that
6110976 yeah youve got a significant minority of democratic votes the question for ed is how do you get from that to 50 percent plus 1
6110977 my biggest challenge is to overcome the name recognition and let people know who i am and also to fight the money he has
6110978 theres so much money involved in politics and he has so much of it
6110979 whether it be an independent or an internal inquiry its something which should have been done
6110980 its as though the people at the top have been burying their heads in the sand hoping the problem would disappear instead its now out in the public domain and once again harness racing is getting a bad wrap
6110981 im not critical of the media for bringing it to the publics attention
6110982 but harness racing gets enough of a hammering without something like this which could have been avoided if the administration had done what they are paid and paid well to do and thats manage
6110983 liz has had a great influence on me and having a family has really helped my cricket

6110989 solamente depende de los venezolanos que el comunismo que pareciera haber llegado haya llegado para quedarse o no eso depende solamente de los venezolanos y eso depende solamente de los venezolanos porque no podemos perder el foco del 23 de noviembre donde masivamente tendremos que salir todos los venezolanos a fijar nuestra posici n

6110996 i am really excited this is obviously my first time playing at senior level and my first time playing at ravenhill in a while so yes i am really excited and looking forward to it in truth i cant wait for friday night
6110997 i will be really proud when i run out ulster is the team i always supported when i was growing up and obviously with david playing for ulster for ten years i have been a regular attendee to the games
6110998 i think it should be good isaac is a class player and in training you can see the international experience he is well organised and looks after his position
6110999 all three ulster scrum halves will be great to play alongside and should cillian willis come on during the game on friday i have no doubt he will do well
6111000 isaac will want to play an exciting game he likes to attack and working from that we should be able to set up some good play from which our backline can attack
6111001 im aware of atletico madrids interest in me and im hopeful ill speak about it with my agent in the next few days
6111002 for sure im excited by the idea of playing for atletico and we are going to wait

6111006 right now im a real madrid player and my future is here
6111007 there is one god and only one intermediary between man and god the man christ jesus
6111008 do i like it no but i play this position for the team and not for myself
6111009 you are working for the team that is why i do it if the team need me i will do it i will play this position but its not easy
6111010 as a player you have to experiment its different how you look at the game but its not easy to adjust because you are playing in premier league
6111011 ive played there before but that was eight or 10 years ago i am a professional though and because the team need me to help i will do it
6111012 the techniques i am okay with but i am no utaka and i am not like a ronaldinho for the football its okay defensively it is good attacking its not
6111013 i like running in midfield i like tackling and keeping the ball but go fast i cant you know
6111014 in the centre of midfield you can pass to the striker go forward come back at the moment this is not me but i will do anything for the good of the team

6111027 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
6111028 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6111029 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6111030 they feel like this is the start of john mccains coming out in terms of embracing the conservative evangelicals
6111031 i think they needed to hear it and they needed to hear it when the question was asked in that way that protections need to come at the moment of conception
6111032 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6111033 most people they dont do this for a living they dont study a candidates record and even when they see a record it has to be backed up by the candidate talking about it and making it important
6111034 people were before just kind of wringing their hands thinking what kind of mess do we have here what kind of choice do we have
6111035 i think he stopped the ambivalence that was out there toward john mccain
6111036 when they see mccains actual position and him talking about it it makes a difference instead of looking at roll call tallies
6111037 this became clearly no longer that this is the best of the two choices and moved from that over to this is a great great candidate that we need to get behind
6111038 either he had a heartfelt conversion on saturday or this is more manipulative electioneering
6111039 what saturday night provided was the closest view of the contrast between the two candidates that weve seen
6111040 when you have eight nine ten eleven twelve candidates running it takes people a while to get enthused
6111041 when you have a choice between someone you agree with on 80 percent of issues and someone who agreed with you on zero the choice becomes crystal clear
6111042 i think he will come a lot closer to sealing the deal if he picks a pro life running mate

6111071 it is normal for a son or daughter to celebrate birthdays they can invite their friends for a meal on this occasion i see nothing wrong in this
6111072 although he is a very learned scholar sheikh al oadah has made a mistake here
6111073 we are prevented by islam to liken ourselves to the nonbelievers

6111115 the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile is a dramatic acceleration for synchronica and i believe that it will build value for our shareholders we aim to build a world leader in the market of consumer mobile email and synchronization solutions and this acquisition is a key milestone which will improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our commercial growth it will increase our ability to sell to customers particularly to those in emerging economies where we see the largest potential growth for mobile email and synchronization with the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile synchronica now has sufficient mass and funding to take advantage of the outstanding opportunity to exploit the commercial potential of mass market mobile email the next few years will be an exciting time for us all here at synchronica and for our customers around the globe we look forward with increased confidence from this inflect on point
6111116 this is the start of an exciting new era for axismobile and our customers there are real synergies between synchronicas products and target markets and our own so it makes great commercial sense to combine forces both companies are committed to open standards and to developing products that work on even the most basic of handsets a must given that the market for mass market mobile email is being fuelled by demand from the developing world we are confident that the combined might of our two companies will prove to be greater than the sum of its parts

6111135 the world is in fact waiting to be designed if only because human beings by necessity have to scale time to their own needs maybe nature will sculpt a windbreak for your campsite in a few thousand years but how much smarter and more efficient to make your own out of a few tree branches and a tarp

6111142 our business is selling hotels throughout the world online if our website is down we dont get any business and as well as the immediate problems that would cause there are also long term repercussions for users who might otherwise have been repeat customers
6111143 iomarts service gives me nothing but complete confidence for me the most important thing is how much the performance of the website has improved which has been of immediate benefit to our business
6111144 iomart has an unquestioning willingness to do whatever needs to be done which weve never experienced before i often get a quicker response from iomart than i do from our own internal it department

6111149 we are providing data points to what is already known about liquefaction in other areas
6111150 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
6111151 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
6111152 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration
6111153 why not take a page out of one diseases book in the fight against other diseases
6111154 we know the closure will inconvenience motorcyclists and four wheelers but we have to close the area for public safety and to protect the area while the vegetation re grows
6111155 we would like to re open the area by early april but the date will depend on how quickly we can complete the restoration actions prescribed by the burn area emergency rehabilitation baer team the severity of winter impacts on roads and trails and how quickly the vegetation recovers we will work closely with ohv user groups to reopen the area as soon as possible
6111156 we want to be sure that re opening the area is neither premature nor unnecessarily delayed
6111157 it will really depend a lot on the weather and how long it will take to mitigate the safety concerns

6111161 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6111162 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6111163 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6111164 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6111165 we tested 43 privately owned horses for the infection the results showed that none of the horses with undiagnosed illnesses had been infected prior to the 1999 outbreak of west nile virus in connecticut usa
6111166 this kind of information is useful in confirming the epidemiology of the virus determining when it arrived in certain areas and how it spreads
6111167 corporations have turned our national nominating conventions into an opportunity for executives and lobbyists to wine dine and schmooze lawmakers all under the pretense of a public purpose
6111168 the only way to return these conventions to the public is to close the loopholes and remove the influence of special interests from the conventions
6111169 the fec should reverse its decisions on corporate sponsorship of host committees and municipal funds
6111170 if the fec refuses to address the issue then congress must rein in this abuse of the electoral process

6111173 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
6111174 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
6111175 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
6111176 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
6111177 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
6111178 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
6111179 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6111180 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
6111181 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

6111189 these have to have a part two otherwise they are completely meaningless
6111190 the graduate program in graphic design differs from the other fine arts in that it is a service and communications field while aesthetics art movements design theory and vocabulary of the art world are similar the end product cannot be self serving for the artist but must convey the message of a client in a degree of clarity or ambiguity appropriate to a subject and audience the level of subtlety in communication has continued to rise in the last twenty years as the public has become savvy and sophisticated in translating media this has led to an exciting diversity of approaches such that no single style dominates contemporary design the profession of graphic design has continued to explode in breadth and depth of its applications until it can no longer be covered well in a single curriculum the field now refers to design for the print industry design for multimedia the web animation overarching design of multidisciplinary projects
6111191 what we do is more akin to a craft or profession and in a craft tradition a lengthy apprenticeship lifelong learning and becoming a mentor to others are all par for the course but it also implies no instant rewards

6111203 the staffing industry is very fragmented and often geographically or industry focused
6111204 the study findings signal the need for a greater investment in marketing and advertising to forge a recognizable and differentiated brand message

6111209 but sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to get back up the preparation and mindset is totally different from when youre starting and when youre not thats where i am at right now i have to be mentally prepared
6111210 heres a guy who toiled in obscurity and played pretty decent in his last game
6111211 when we put him on the practice roster he understood theres consequences for not being prepared there wont be any more lapses he understands ask him
6111212 the coaching staff gave me some credit for the edmonton win and that was the first time in three years it felt pretty good
6111213 we have a problem on our d line right now with the number of injuries we have
6111214 we had a guy who was available and we went out and got him we want to make sure we always address our concerns when it comes to injuries by position
6111215 we think adam braidwood should be fine to go sometime during the course of the month of september but as a coach as an organization we cant just sit back and keep our fingers crossed on whether a guy will be ready the second week of september the third week of september the first week of october what happens if theres a setback
6111216 we expect him back to be healthy enough to play the labour day game
6111217 we will have absolutely no issues with the salary cap we have done an outstanding job of managing it even with the so called surplus of players
6111218 i never had to tackle players before now i have to when youre coming at a guy whos bigger than you how do you tackle him defensive co ordinator chris jones always says to shoot for the legs if you take out the legs everything else will fall
6111219 they have a lot of receivers in front of me so he jones suggested to try me at db he said
6111220 it was another opportunity for me so i had to just roll with it and i was ready to basically play any position on the field to get a job

6111222 i think right now im happy with the weight im at and im just striving to maintain it
6111223 theres a lot less pressure on my knees so they feel better than ever
6111224 it doesnt hurt when youre trying to tackle guys but it can on some double teams
6111225 a big part of our defence is the two tackles taking up double teams to free up linebackers ive noticed it a little bit on that but nothing major
6111226 im using my hands and that kind of thing sometimes it can be tough to fight through that stuff but not often
6111227 they have the no 1 coverage team on special teams so thats a big challenge for us
6111228 if we want to be the no 1 return team we have to beat the no 1 cover team its a big challenge and itll be fun
6111229 if its hurdles ill win if its a sprint hell win
6111230 if we do race and he beats me i wont be able to say i would win

6111947 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register

6112070 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6112071 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6112072 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6112073 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6112074 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

6112078 yesterday we got a call from her consultant to say she had cancer of the cervix and so she has to come back straight away
6112079 she is obviously traumatised and very worried and is now focused on getting home
6112080 they now have to carry out tests into other areas to see if the cancer has spread
6112081 doctors told me theres a strong chance of cancer and that i should have a hysterectomy but i wont let them
6112082 she seemed ok as she got off the plane but as she was walking through the terminal she just broke down she seemed really upset
6112083 its always difficult working away from home but i cant wait around for the doctors to find out whats wrong with me
6112084 i know it sounds crazy and a lot of people will criticise me for it but i have to pay the bills at the end of the day
6112085 and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
6112086 i will worry for my beautiful boys if i get unwell i live for them

6112089 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6112090 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6112091 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6112092 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6112093 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6112094 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6112095 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6112096 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6112097 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6112098 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6112099 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6112100 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6112101 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6112102 would usually smile and nod and say that i understood the skepticism but that there was and always had been another tradition to politics a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it then we might not solve every problem but we can get something meaningful done
6112103 enough of them appreciated my earnestness and youthful swagger that i made it to the illinois legislature

6112112 can say yes to nuclear trade with india if two simple conditions are met
6112113 first india must sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty a step already taken by 178 other countries and every member state of the nuclear suppliers group
6112114 second india must agree to halt production of nuclear material for weapons
6112115 would prove to the international community that opening up nuclear commerce would not assist either directly or indirectly its nuclear weapons program
6112116 countries such as iran and north korea would certainly use the precedent to their advantage

6112122 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6112123 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6112124 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6112125 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6112126 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6112127 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6112128 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6112129 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6112130 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6112131 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6112132 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6112133 who are open to doing something on the production side
6112134 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6112135 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6112136 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6112137 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6112138 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6112139 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6112140 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6112141 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6112142 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6112143 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6112144 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6112145 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6112146 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6112147 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6112148 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6112149 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6112150 they had real form factor problems with this product they correct those issues
6112151 you can expect every product to be an improvement over the last one
6112152 is it a breakthrough product i dont think it is
6112153 it will let the rest of the company shine through though
6112154 using names is more memorable and consistent with our brand
6112155 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6112156 i feel lied to by the organization its hard for them to ask me to give my all when it hasnt been reciprocated
6112157 well here we are a year later and still no new deal
6112158 the deals they put on the table were slaps in the face as opposed to deals that would take care of me
6112159 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
6112160 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6112161 incredible performance by usain bolt once again he finished up in an incredible time this was an incredible performance he wanted that record
6112162 he got an incredible start i looked at his start and just went wow it was more amazing than the 100 metres guys that tall should not be able to start like that
6112163 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6112164 my concern was he would not have the ability to hold that speed for the entire race but he showed he has been working on that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record

6112169 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6112170 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6112171 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her

6112175 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6112182 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6112183 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6112184 they said we dont have time to deal with your acquaintances

6112188 they went to the houses of people who were community leaders
6112189 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6112190 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6112191 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6112192 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6112193 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6112194 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6112195 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6112196 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6112197 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6112200 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6112201 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6112202 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6112203 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6112204 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6112205 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6112206 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6112207 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6112208 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6112209 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6112210 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6112211 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6112212 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6112213 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6112214 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6112215 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6112216 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6112217 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6112218 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6112219 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6112223 he has a fantastic sense of humor and is good for morale he can get along with all types of personalities he also trains other peri support staff
6112224 brian is alert to the needs of the or its staff and its patients
6112225 he maintains an upbeat and friendly attitude even when all the rooms are breaking at once he enjoys learning he is cross trained as anesthesia support and is willing to step in and out of that role as necessary he likes to learn as much as he can about surgical procedures which ultimately decreases the turnaround time between cases this increases patient safety and satisfaction
6112226 he was helpful at very crucial junctions when patient outcomes were so time critical

6112231 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6112232 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6112233 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6112234 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6112740 it concerned people in this office that maybe there was some exploitation of children going on
6112741 para nosotros los tyranids son una manera de otorgarle a los fan ticos algo que han estado pidiendo desde
6112742 isnt it obvious its because no one in white america wants to vote for a nigger
6112743 it is amazing how similar the image scores appear to be for both barack obama and john mccain if obama is this agent of change that america has been waiting for why is his image no better than the nominee from the other party a political party whose brand is supposed to be so badly damaged
6112744 voters are looking for change that gives obama a real advantage in this election even as mccain tries to reinvent himself among undecided voters obama has a decided advantage in being better liked this poll also modeled a traditional electorate however obama has the ability to change the electorate simulating modest gains in youth turnout takes the ballot to a 2 point advantage for obama changing the face of the electorate is obamas ace in the hole
6112745 the candidates will use the upcoming conventions to reinforce their positive and comparative messages this survey acts as an important benchmark going into the remaining weeks of the campaign which includes the vice presidential picks acceptance speeches and three scheduled debates
6112746 the positive re evaluation of john mccain is the untold story of the last three months of this election john mccains biggest comparative gain over the last three months has come on the issue of gas and energy prices
6112747 obama has a decisive advantage on the economy and domestic agenda for the middle class that will determine this election among voters overall he is ahead 9 points on the economy and 15 points on being for the middle class among undecided voters obama is ahead 12 points and 27 points respectively that should translate into decisively taking the undecided voters
6112748 look at how the field flowers grow they do no work nor do they weave and yet i tell you not even solomon in all his finery was ever as well dressed as just one of them if that is how god clothes the grass in the field will he not much more clothe you you of little faith
6112749 i recall john f kennedy president of the united states when he became president he recommended his brother right and his brother was elected
6112750 still a private citizen not on the ballot yet thats the way hes conducting himself
6112751 there are 37 members and the last i counted theres probably about 36 of them whod like to have the position
6112752 that one person who says they dont want it is probably lying
6112753 its kinda hard to campaign with you guys in front of us
6112754 i have support from all over not just in chicago i think it can bring about a different atmosphere down here
6112755 theres some quality people over there that we would hope would become president that would work with us
6112756 thats not the way its been we welcome the change
6112757 i think its time that the senate governs we need to just focus on that and try to put some of the personalities behind us well work together and move forward
6112758 smarter minds will prevail and those who dont have an opportunity will come together for unity in the senate democratic party
6112759 i dont think henry kissinger let alone a new senate president can bring the governor and speaker together
6112760 or it could be a blank talk like a blank book
6112761 if i can try to match up the words then the rest will follow

6112766 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6112767 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is 1 of 4 models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just 5 years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6112768 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6112769 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6112770 er waren echter geen afgevaardigden van de hogere instanties aanwezig en de directie weigerde opnieuw om tegemoet te komen aan onze eisen
6112771 the execution of these people is in accordance with the new regulations called the social security enhancement plan
6112772 my understanding is that these so called insurgents are special people the date of their execution is not a routine practice normally every last wednesday of each month the tehran criminal prosecutors office carries out the executions but in this case they will be executed on sunday these are people who have had their trial in either enghelab islami the islamic revolutionary courts or in the special crimes courts
6112773 until the employers who havent talked to us for three months come back round the negotiating table and talk about the real issues affecting their workers the issue of not being able to pay the bills
6112774 i believe the public understand the frustration at an offer that would lock council workers into a 2 5 pay offer for three years when inflation is way ahead of that and rising yet the employers have failed to invite us back to talk to them since before the strike ballot was called
6112775 the resounding response to the strike shows just how angry our members are at taking what is a pay cut when the cost of living is soaring members always respond well in edinburgh but this time the support for the action has surpassed even our expectations
6112776 the public response on the picket lines has been fantastic they clearly understand the fairness of our case our low paid members cannot go on subsidising services
6112777 isnt god everywhere and isnt he krishna as well as allah
6112778 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6112779 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6112780 i believe in roe v wade and i come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
6112781 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress and in the senate
6112782 and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment to you
6112783 i thought that obama did as well as he could have done given his worldview and given the format and i thought mccain was better than ive ever seen him i think he assuaged some of social conservatives doubts about his commitment to the pro life cause and his understanding of it
6112784 i think he made a clear contrast between himself and barack obama if he can continue with the kind of fervor and integration of issues and faith i think that he may be on to a new high in his campaign if he retreats to a place of not wanting to talk anymore about these kinds of things i think it will not help him so it was a tremendous win i think its a new chapter i hope it continues
6112785 i would submit that he shouldnt be receiving the salary of president if he doesnt know the answer to a very basic medical question thats uniformly reported in every medical textbook every modern day embryology and fetology book in existence
6112786 we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over
6112787 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do
6112788 either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing and that answer was extremely weak and shows us the hypocrisy in his position on that issue i think it would be more refreshing for him if he would just be honest about it and say he favors gay marriage he cannot do that because the american people do not favor gay marriage
6112789 i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman
6112790 in my state i hope we will make that decision and other states they have made that decision to recognize the unique status between man and woman and that doesnt mean that people cant enter into legal agreements that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman
6112791 i f a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided on gay marriage then i would favor a federal constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
6112792 i dont think that he was as strong enough a jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6112793 i would not nominate justice scalia although i dont think theres any doubt about his intellectual brilliance because he and i just disagree
6112794 i think that the president of the united states has incredible responsibility in nominating people to the united states supreme court
6112795 this nomination should be based on the criteria of a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
6112796 jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
6112797 i am wildly optimistic that skin cell research which is coming more and more into focus and practicability will make this debate an academic one
6112798 i f in fact adult stem cell lines are working just as well then of course we should try to avoid any kind of moral arguments that may be in place
6112799 i think its something that we should sit down and figure out working between non governmental organizations national institutions the u s government and try to figure out what can we do
6112800 i think we have to make adoption a lot easier in this country thats why so many people go to other countries to be able to adopt children

6112922 but i think that some companies are open to further discussions even on the basis of the relationship and some companies do not believe that it is worth the time
6112923 the race in iowa while relatively close appears to be moving in obamas direction
6112924 most importantly for obama his supporters are much more likely to say they strongly support him which makes them much more likely to turn out on election day and much more likely to talk to friends and neighbors volunteer in the campaign and do the kinds of things that win elections typically those who are less supportive are also less motivated to vote no matter how much they say ahead of time that theyll turn out to vote
6112925 while both candidates have secured their party bases the battle over independents continues in iowa
6112926 while independents are leaning more toward mccain at this time the substantial lead in democratic registration over republican in iowa means obama does not have to win independents to win iowa as long as he is winning 90 percent or more of democrats he does however have to keep things close
6112927 confidence in your candidate is another motivator to actually get out and vote
6112928 when you believe you will win its all the more reason to show up at the polls when you think you will lose its easier to not bother so again obama voters appear likely to be more motivated in november
6112929 barack obama is a black man will make it more difficult for friends and neighbors to vote for him
6112930 theres a substantial minority of voters concerned about the effects of race on the election
6112931 we cant directly ask voters if they are unwilling to vote for someone because of race but we can ask what they think others will do the fact that obama voters are much more concerned than mccain voters shows there is a fear among those who support obama that others will be less likely to support him because of his race mccain voters can safely say its not a worry because if its an issue their candidate will benefit
6112932 while many of those who express belief that race will make an obama vote more difficult think it will only be a little more difficult for their friends and neighbors to vote for him nearly a quarter of iowa voters see obamas race as a more significant stumbling block
6112933 of course we dont completely know their thoughts obama supporters are probably worried that their candidate will be hurt by his race and are projecting that worry on others
6112934 while many mccain supporters may agree it will be difficult for obama they would prefer to see their candidate win so if race does hurt obama its not as much a concern to them personally it seems clear though that race is a factor even if its hard to quantify
6112935 perceptions of obamas religion may turn out to be equally or more important than his race in the 2008 election especially among those who perceive him to be a muslim
6112936 iowa voters are similar to those in other states in terms of their likelihood of believing obama is muslim while mccain supporters are more likely to believe this we cannot necessarily draw the conclusion that they support mccain because of this belief mccain supporters may simply have no reason to learn obamas religion at the same time its certainly possible some of these voters support mccain because of their belief that obama is muslim
6112937 its very clear that voters who continue to support george bush will vote for john mccain
6112938 not only is this a simple continuation of partisan support but mccain is clearly associated with supporting much of the bush agenda and voters recognize the connection
6112939 the challenge for obama lies with independents who disapprove of bush while mccain has the support of more than 8 in 10 bush supporters obama is only picking up 6 in 10 of those who disapprove of bush this gap is allowing mccain to claim a plurality of all independent voters at this time
6112940 following a rigorous review of operating performance and local market dynamics these company owned outlets are not producing acceptable returns
6112941 taking this action now will allow us to focus our attention on locations with the best long term potential
6112942 it will help position goodyear to be a stronger competitor
6112943 the truth is that cars produce about 10 cent of man made co2 and transport accounts for about 23 per cent
6112944 the rest comes from power generation home heating and business activity
6112945 but this does not excuse cars from a responsibility to reduce their co2 emissions
6112946 that challenge is both enormous and exciting for every passenger kilometre travelled in an average car in the uk today about 130g km is emitted compared with about 100g km for an average bus and 80g km for an average train
6112947 markets can do one of three things go up go down or go sideways

6113200 i am trying to figure it out but i think i have it narrowed down to two or three spots
6113201 today was pretty much going around and trying to look at places and i got lost
6113202 well we were driving around and my real estate agent knew where she was going but i had no idea where we were
6113203 but once i come back ill get to see more of the city
6113204 last year was a tough year and i put that behind me and start off with a clean slate now
6113205 no not really ive just got to prove everyone wrong right
6113206 when i was young claude julien coached me in junior and he pretty much got me thinking about my work ethic
6113207 back home i didnt play very much hockey 10 to 15 games a year max so i didnt really put much effort in sometimes on the ice because i didnt really need to when i was home
6113208 but he taught me to do that because hes a coach that tries to get the most out of every player
6113209 he got the most out of me and i think thats why weve worked pretty well together
6113210 last year was a tough year for him and he probably didnt quite fit as he did in the past
6113211 this is an opportunity to come to a team that i think will definitely use his type of player to its advantage
6113212 he is good down low strong on the puck and has a great release and a good shot
6113213 he is capable of being physical and i think our style of play fits him to a t theres no doubt hell be a good fit for our hockey club
6113214 i just have to go out and play my game and everything will work out
6113215 last year was a tough year and i put that behind me and start off with a clean slate now
6113216 this summers pretty much been trying to stay in shape and making sure that i get off to a good start and help the team just try and start winning right away and get into the playoffs

6113225 we became interested in using rposts registered e mail service after our firm went through a procedures audit in relation to our e amp o renewal the proper use of e mail was one of the focal points of the audit through the audit we learned that courts would not always admit traditional e mail as evidence we realized we needed to be able to have legally verifiable proof that our e mails were sent received and had not been altered
6113226 since katrina the insurance industry has become more sensitive to agent client and agent carrier broker communications as we are dealing more with non standard policy forms and a constantly changing set of policy terms and conditions rpost is an essential tool to help us manage this communication by e mail
6113227 the encryption capability was the main reason kapnick insurance group started the using rpost service it was the only encryption solution that met our needs we looked at many encryption solution providers and selected rpost because it was the most cost effective and user friendly
6113228 our clients love the fact that they can open their encrypted e mail within moments of receiving it before we switched to rpost our clients had to go through a multi step registration process to receive their encrypted e mail this was a hassle for ourcustomers rpost has allowed us to decrease our costs improve our productivity and cut down on both employee and client frustration
6113229 standard e mail sent or received archived in electronic or in printed form has limited evidentiary value to protect in case of a dispute standard e mail lacks verifiable proof of delivery content of e mails and attachments uniform time sent and received and transaction audit trails
6113230 what people tend to overlook is the fact that with a couple clicks you can change any e mail to say anything print it out and represent it as fact or worse the other party could claim you did so for our insurance customers since much of their communication with clients and carriers takes place over the phone having the ability to follow up by e mail to bind coverage verify terms and conditions or change coverage is critical once you have a claim you cant go back and change the terms and conditions

6113242 nfl schedules were a source of difficulty using the web for nfl schedule prints out for easy display in office cube or home

6113244 not an easy task finding good websites on the internet let alone for printable football schedule for nfl

6113248 its incredible that the keeping position for england has become this big thing
6113249 the way i try and look at it is that you cant take it too personally otherwise you put yourself under too much pressure and you cant perform
6113250 i learned a huge amount from being involved with england before and i come back a year later as a more mature person and cricketer im really looking forward to doing the job and doing it better
6113251 its very easy to become quite intense i guess thats all about wanting to do well and no matter how it comes out on the field youre just trying to do well and put your best performance in
6113252 ive never shied away from hard work and ive always worked hard on my game but things like going back to your hotel and not thinking about anything else but the next day you have to have your break away from it and your release
6113253 i think coming back a year older and wiser i will have found a nice balance between the time when youre on and when you are off and let yourself relax a little bit
6113254 it wasnt the quietest of summers it was rather up and down
6113255 when i was first thrown out into the international scene there was a lot to learn
6113256 a lot of it was off the field than on it and you dont know how you are going to deal with that until you are there
6113257 to have that experience behind me is massive and hopefully i will be able to deal with it better this time around
6113258 i feel proud of myself this time around because when you are left out people give you stick and say that is the end and he will never be back
6113259 to come back and perform for sussex the way i have i am quite proud of it shows a bit of mental toughness to and i am pleased with how i have done it but there is a lot of hard work to come

6113263 i started the site for a simple reason i felt ill served by the undemocratic gatekeeping mentality so prevalent in our society and at that time we seemed to be on an inexorable march toward war with no avenue for dissent there was an assumption by the powers that be that the rest of the citizen body couldnt think for ourselves that we needed self appointed and so called experts to tell us what to think what to do and what we should or should not know for far too long these gatekeepers controlled the national conversation

6113299 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
6113300 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
6113301 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
6113302 japan which has suffered atomic bomb attacks should take the initiative in blocking the deal
6113303 it would be a pity if japan only follows us policy irrespective of what is just
6113304 india needs to join the npt first if it wants civilian use of nuclear energy
6113305 if this kind of exception is approved that means that the international community accepts india as a nuclear power that would shake the nonproliferation regime under the npt

6113309 the c ram initiative at jrtc has made significant strides in improving the force protection training for army brigade combat teams bcts as they prepare for eventual deployments to iraq and afghanistan
6113310 the great training that jrtc and the c ram program office provides here will continue to lay the foundation for success this training provides the maneuver commander with another tool to defeat the perimeter threat that we see today in theater
6113311 ibdsos provides the fob commander with an integrated set of capabilities that is designed to protect against and defeat perimeter threats
6113312 ibdsos is an integral part of c ram and provides the ground commander with additional capabilities to help defeat the insurgent threat and prevent loss of life
6113313 the ibdsos training that weve received here has been outstanding
6113314 our ability to immediately get eyes on a potential threat allows us to provide immediate early warning of a potential attack to personnel on the fob and that helps us save lives
6113315 fully incorporating all the joint assets into ibdsos training also means improving the ability to provide early warning to personnel located on the fobs and give forces time to take appropriate actions and defeat this type of irregular warfare threat eventually we will digitally integrate ibdsos and c ram system information with joint fires and command and control systems that will greatly improve shared situational awareness among coalition forces and make it easier to defeat fob threats
6113316 our ability to integrate joint assets with our own fires capabilities cuts down on the time to gain a positive identification on a threat and that helps us to respond quickly and appropriately
6113317 ibdsos provides us with a mission essential capability that will give our unit an unprecedented level of force protection once we deploy in theater

6113331 scola offers programming in every one of the over 40 languages that msu students are learning
6113332 for some languages like kazakh there are no textbooks or materials to help students learn the language
6113333 access to foreign language television plays an important role in the cocurricular support for language learning at msu
6113334 not only does it help instructors stay up to date themselves as they prepare classes and assignments it also enlivens the classroom with engaging multimedia content its appropriate that scola is arriving on campus in 2008 which has been named the international year of languages by the united nations
6113335 with msu being a global university and having a global focus we wanted to provide the best international service possible for individuals on campus
6113336 the program will benefit those native of a foreign country and also for people who are scholars studying foreign languages or cultures while attending msu
6113337 the ability to study a foreign language is enhanced by news or cultural programming like that of which is offered by scola
6113338 youre seeing how people in a foreign country are interpreting world events all of those things help convey the culture as well as the language

6113409 moms conventional wisdom of eating fruits and vegetables to lead a healthy life has evolved into more scientific fact finding research during the last four decades due to advances in science
6113410 studies are showing the importance of fruits vegetables and nuts in reducing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases
6113411 it is befitting that the society is focusing more on health and preventing diseases

6113423 this will be the first time since sputnik when the united states will not have a significant space superiority i remain dumbfounded that weve allowed this serious threat to our national security to develop

6113428 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
6113429 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big or big banks
6113430 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over

6113432 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys
6113433 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink

6113436 whether its for grain sugar or high tonnage source of lignocellulose most of you in attendance at this conference are committed to making sorghum the preferred dedicated feedstock for production of ethanol and other liquid fuels
6113437 i think we are on the brink of one of the greatest challenges in history
6113438 we have an existing cooperation between the usda and the chinese ministry for science and technology
6113439 we cooperate on several initiatives signing this protocol represents formal cooperation in the area of biofuels research
6113440 cooperate in establishing processes and infrastructure for conversion of sweet sorghum and other feedstocks to ethanol
6113441 todays signing establishes a virtual joint center for a series of projects that are very specific to the two centers
6113442 we also intend to include universities and business in both china and the united states we can now focus on specific areas of cooperation
6113443 this is a milestone for the sorghum industry and for our members as the world turns its attention to sorghum
6113444 sorghums water sipping qualities short growing season and ability to grow on 80 percent of the worlds land including some marginal agricultural areas really lends it to biofuels production as the u s and the world face pressing issues with energy independence and economic difficulties

6113464 bruno du hattest in diesem jahr schon sehr viel pech wie gehst du damit um
6113465 ich denke es w re fair zu sagen dass jeder mal ein bisschen pech haben kann ich hatte in dieser saison zwei ungl ckliche rennen als ich in der t rkei den hund angefahren habe und als ich in magny cours den defekt hatte man muss das einfach abhaken und wenn m glich daraus lernen
6113466 du bist aktuell zweiter in der gp2 bist du zufrieden
6113467 ich bin happy mit gesamtrang zwei arbeite aber hart daran die l cke auf giorgio pantano zu schlie en mit einem starken saisonendspurt kann ich die meisterschaft gewinnen und darauf konzentriere ich mich
6113468 2008 ist deine zweite saison in der gp2 wird es auch die letzte sein
6113469 wenn ich weiter hart arbeite und gute leistungen bringe werden sich mir m glichkeiten er ffnen aber garantien hat man nie
6113470 meine familie war ganz aus dem h uschen vor allem meine mutter
6113471 dein sieg in monaco muss etwas ganz besonderes gewesen sein
6113472 ja es war 15 jahre nachdem mein onkel dort zum letzten mal gefahren ist deshalb war es etwas besonderes meine familie war ganz aus dem h uschen vor allem meine mutter sie hat sich noch mehr gefreut als ich
6113473 was w rde dich aus professioneller sicht in den n chsten wochen gl cklich machen
6113474 in den n chsten wochen bin ich hoffentlich konkurrenzf hig und hole so viele punkte wie m glich wir haben in dieser saison nur noch sechs rennen das ist nicht mehr viel bisher war es so dass der titeltr ger der gp2 eine gro e chance hat in die formel 1 aufzusteigen damit habe ich einen wirklichen anreiz
6113475 es gibt in der serie viele gute fahrer giorgio pantano der gesamtf hrender ist romain grosjean ist ein talentierter junger fahrer und mein isport teamkollege karun chandhok hat in dieser saison auch schon sein talent gezeigt
6113476 ich wei noch nicht was in der n chsten saison passieren wird
6113477 es gibt viele ger chte dass du demn chst in die formel 1 wechselst was sagst du dazu
6113478 ich wurde mit mehreren formel 1 teams in verbindung gebracht das ist nat rlich schmeichelhaft aber ich wei noch nicht was in der n chsten saison passieren wird im moment konzentriere ich mich nur auf die gp2
6113479 du bist auch in der gp2 asia gefahren meistens bei sehr hohen temperaturen und manchmal auch im regen also bei extremen bedingungen wie f hlen sich die bridgestone reifen dabei an
6113480 ich mag die bridgestone reifen sowohl bei hei en als auch bei nassen bedingungen sie funktionieren in nassen und sind bei hohen temperaturen sehr haltbar wenn die reifen mehr gefordert werden und eigentlich h ufiger gewechselt werden
6113481 ja es ist zwar wegen des geringen grips schwierig aber ich mag die herausforderung ich bin in dieser saison im nassen gut unterwegs gewesen vor allem in silverstone wo ich das sprintrennen gewonnen habe
6113482 dein onkel war ein wahrer meister im regen hat er dir tipps gegeben als du als kleiner junge kart gefahren bist
6113483 als ich klein war sind wir auf unserer farm in brasilien kart gefahren dabei hat er mir die basics ber racing und rennlinien beigebracht
6113484 in hockenheim hast du auf regenreifen gewechselt war das die richtige entscheidung
6113485 der regen hat die sache am schluss sehr sehr schwer gemacht auch wenn mir die herausforderung spa gemacht hat das team hat entschieden ein bisschen zu pokern und auf regenreifen zu wechseln ich denke dass das die richtige entscheidung war aber wir h tten ein paar runden mehr gebraucht um den vorteil nutzen zu k nnen
6113486 ich bin mir ziemlich sicher dass ich auf das podium gefahren w re wenn es trocken geblieben w re es war frustrierend so lange hinter di grassi festzuh ngen denn ich h tte viel schneller fahren k nnen als er meine vorderreifen haben sehr gelitten weil ich hinter ihm hing in der folge hat sich das auto nicht mehr so gut angef hlt als ich an ihm vorbei war aber ich war immer noch schneller als buemi und h tte sicher platz drei holen k nnen aber dann hat es geregnet
6113487 ist der grip der wichtigste faktor um sich im auto wohl zu f hlen
6113488 ich denke dass er sehr viel dazu beitr gt es ist ein wichtiger teil der abstimmung
6113489 wenn man die gp2 asia und die gp2 europa vergleicht welche bevorzugst du
6113490 die gp2 europa ist st rker es gibt mehr fahrer die gewinnen k nnen es gibt auch mehr konkurrenzf hige teams zudem bevorzuge ich die europ ischen autos da sie mehr power und weichere reifen haben

6113515 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
6113516 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
6113517 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
6113518 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
6113519 until the special committee receives the offer or completes its review it will not comment on the offer nor will it speculate as to any future course of action it or the company may take

6113522 although the recent correlation in dollar and oil prices is clear it is important to emphasize that each of these assets are driven by multiple varying factors put differently there is more to oil than the u s dollar and vice versa
6113523 there are quite a few signs of demand warnings from asia it is a new development and it has not been factored in
6113524 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6113525 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6113526 monopolies clearly dont work and the baa monopoly has done huge damage to competition and the traveling public and it is high time it was broken up
6113527 this is not the end of the competition commission process
6113528 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive
6113529 we would also expect the uncertainty of changes toughening to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value
6113530 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
6113531 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight

6113597 most of the times we have played in sri lanka it is not a bowlers paradise especially for the fast bowlers full credit to the fast bowlers for coming out with flying colours in tough conditions they bowled in right areas
6113598 in the last two games seamers got help but they may not get these conditions in the coming three games
6113599 it was turning a bit also so it was a bit tough when in one end we had a batsman but in other end it was open with the tailenders of course it was a concerned area till the match got over

6113604 he was unsteady on his feet and the right side of his face was covered in blood he was crying and not making any sense
6113605 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach
6113606 i was nearly knocked down there once so when the police van went the wrong way i sort of said hey mate no entry but he just shouted out of the window expletive off this is police business
6113607 it was very frightening all i had done was photograph these police officers doing something illegal but i was the one who ended up being arrested

6113609 how come a whole building caught fire in an hour where are the fire alarms and where are the sprinklers
6113610 but in 1998 we managed to control the fire in the room it erupted in
6113611 we heard air conditioners blowing up and wooden shutters caught fire and flew in the air
6113612 we brought our extinguishers to be ready in case of the fire reached our building
6113613 its a different field if you will but its no less important

6113616 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor

6113622 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6113623 should they initiate the draft you know the age is 18 if we can go out and fight and die for our country and you cant have a beer that doesnt make a lot of sense to me
6113624 whether the drinking age is 18 or 21 i dont think it really matters because if people are going to abuse alcohol theyre going to do it regardless of the law
6113625 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6113626 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
6113627 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6113628 we also need to keep in mind that alcohol related traffic fatalities reached a ten year high in 2006
6113629 theyve been going up in the last ten years we also need to keep in mind that peer reviewed research shows more than 1 000 lives of 18 to 24 year olds are lost each year off the highways to alcohol the evidence is not all on one side of this debate and we need to consider all of those data and consider whether 21 is in fact serving us well
6113630 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6113631 we know the 21 minimum age drinking law does work
6113632 theres 48 highly backed studies to back the fact that the law does work it saved over 1 000 young peoples lives every year for the last 24 years why would we go back we tried this in the 70s and 80s it simply did not work then alcohol related fatalities went up in that age group
6113633 college presidents dont want this passed down to them from college presidents who are being irresponsible
6113634 we know that people continue to drive for instance after a drunk driving conviction
6113635 theyll simply drive without their license up to 75 percent of convicted drunk drivers continue to drive why would we think that 18 year olds would drive or not drive you know its not the solution
6113636 the presidential statement simply says that based on our own experience and 24 years of this law on the books we believe theres evidence to show that 21 is not working that it has had unintended consequences and that it is well past time to open public debate about all of the effects of this law on our campuses and elsewhere
6113637 removing that 10 percent incentive is the surest way to resume the debate that needs to take place
6113638 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
6113639 its very upsetting for us because we cant accommodate these people
6113640 so its just really sickening and theres very little we can do with it except try to have people deal with legitimate ticket agents
6113641 we paid 500 for two vip tickets to george michael

6113646 we cannot possibly prevent individuals visiting and purchasing from sites like these that appear without warning and usually disappear without warning too

6113662 the next step is for all sadc countries to develop national plans of action to implement the protocol

6113676 for at least 11 years chubb has had in effect a policy that bars its member companies from maintaining an office in burma directly writing insurance in burma providing insurance into burma from outside the country or entering into any transaction with the government of burma
6113677 this is a major embarrassment to lloyds of london they have never taken this issue seriously and dont see any problem with helping finance burmas brutal dictatorship
6113678 insurance companies are facilitating trade and investment in burma filling the pockets of the generals and helping keep them in power

6113681 we are disappointed to see that he gambari is drifting away from his main mission of facilitating national reconciliation if we look at where he is going and who he is meeting it is hardly encouraging
6113682 when he talked about free and fair elections in 2010 we asked him about his views on the results of the 1990 elections but he did not answer he also declined to answer when we asked him what his mission was and when we asked him whether he had met daw aung san suu kyi he said no he is still trying

6113725 everyone says hes a dog but he played well for me
6113726 he ran every ball out played well defensively he can flat hit but if the power is there its going to be late coming
6113727 hes letting more of his personality come through being more vocal taking charge more
6113728 you hear him more in the clubhouse and in the dugout hes even doing some teaching
6113729 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task

6113736 o victorie a noastra ne ar face sa depindem doar de noi la ultimele doua jocuri esential e ca pina la final sa acumulam 17 puncte care ne ar garanta calificarea deoarece franta nu poate obtine mai mult de atit iar rezultatele directe in fata lor ne sint favorabile
6113737 analizand punctual potentialul conflictului transnistrean putem spune ca el are toate mecanismele duse pana la limita la care el sa poata izbucni dar nu sunt conditiile in momentul de fata pentru ca acest conflict sa poata izbucni elementele conflictuale sunt create si acolo ca si in osetia ca si in kosovo exista elementul minoritar consolidat si concentrat intr o regiune si asa zisa legitimitate a tarii mama de a interveni in apararea propriilor cetateni nu sunt conditiile politice dar din punct de vedere al aranjamentelor de detonare a conflictului ele sunt facute definitivate a fost mecanismul kosovo repetat identic in osetia si pregatit perfect in transnistria

6113742 this is extremely bad news for consumers who may be considering consolidating existing debts to try to drive down their monthly expenditure
6113743 at a time when every penny counts if you need a personal loan you need to make sure that you shop around as it is highly unlikely your bank will offer the best deal
6113744 we are living through a period of inflating prices and mortgages are no exception
6113745 the bank of england can cut rates but as we have seen over the past year there is no guarantee this will translate into a lower true cost of
6113746 consumers are feeling anxious and have every right to be with the governments inability to reassure the market especially over the issue of stamp duty

6113757 unfortunately with unemployment set to rise significantly and the mortgage credit squeeze likely to persist the situation will only get worse
6113758 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation
6113759 becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
6113760 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
6113761 this rapid re adjustment during the last three months comes as some discretionary sellers choose not to enter the market leaving a higher proportion of forced sellers who price more aggressively
6113762 the recommendations in our report are aimed at benefiting both landlords and tenants by enabling them to use existing legal processes more productively thereby more fully realising the intended impact of housing legislation
6113763 implementation of these reforms would not only improve rental conditions for tenants but also help to build the reputation and professionalism of landlords
6113764 in the current market conditions the costs of a new mortgage can prove too much of an extra burden to customers our new fee free offset tracker offers a great mortgage rate with no costs at all apart from the loan itself
6113765 also with the offset facility it means that even if customers only credit their salary every month with no extra savings they will be better off than with the equivalent non offset mortgage at the same rate
6113766 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
6113767 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average over 21 000 cheaper than last month
6113768 these are products for our times offering flexibility and value the average annual rate of these products is exactly the same as our existing flat rate 5 year fixed mortgage 6 19 per cent
6113769 whether you are looking to get on the housing ladder and need to keep you costs low or are planning ahead for a time when your budget will be tighter we now have the mortgage products to help
6113770 we know consumers are feeling the pinch enough at present so we hope this gesture will help those looking to reduce outgoings and boost income in retirement
6113771 this is especially true when you combine this with the flexibility offered by just retirements drawdown product which means individuals only pay interest on the amount they draw down and not on the overall agreed amount

6113796 and i think its fine that he didnt do that because its up to us to draw the conclusion whether its actually there or not
6113797 like most works of merit the works of dr seuss have been overanalyzed many scholars have found devices where there are truly none to be found for the most part ted enjoyed writing entertaining books that encouraged children to read
6113798 and it fits so neatly into the configuration of the christian message that im convinced that he knew what he was doing
6113799 i was amazed at what i found when i started looking at it all this christian imagery was very carefully factored into his stories
6113800 and thats what this book intends to do is show how he has done this in a very carefully crafted way its there and you could make an argument for it being intentionally there because its done with such great care

6113802 he doesnt like to talk about when he was a pow
6113803 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
6113804 dont you know how i got this done roy johnson and paul hubbert got this done for me
6113805 she said if lane ever comes to montgomery looking for money for the city program im going to tell him youre fired fueled by a belief she didnt have to answer to anybody
6113806 no one person no matter how powerful is above the law
6113807 never smarted off to anybody in her life you can look at her and tell she thought she had been blindsided
6113808 with that one contact she may have saved that program
6113809 did sue schmitz scheme and intend to steal money did she steal money the keyword intent do i get paid without good results some time you bet sue schmitz did not steal any money
6113810 youre going to hear a lot of things that can be interpreted a lot of ways
6113811 she was out there working she got a bus donated to huntsville city program she got furniture from northrop grumman ng for city she got computers donated for three different centers she contacted ng shes not a web site maker she got that done she got 7500 from ng for city
6113812 she came to my office to ask me for assistance she was not able to continue her job as a teacher she asked me to make a change in the budget for the community intensive training for youth city program so a job that was available would be funded
6113813 she had to quit from the legislature or find another job she wanted to stay in education and she wanted to continue building her teachers retirement she talked to people at random and she talked to people doing that she knew had contacts to help find her a job
6113814 i dont think id go to the man cutting the grass to help find a job first she went to dr paul hubbert director of her professional association he will testify here i hope and he will say she is appreciated he knew sue well shed been supportive and he wanted to help her he called dr roy johnson said sue schmitz needs a job that was the end of that conversation
6113815 i met with the speaker and he asked me if we could be of assistance in finding employment
6113816 looked across our system to see what we might have available or could be created in the area in which she lived
6113817 but i didnt have a resume didnt know much about her
6113818 i have a request from hammett and paul hubbert and asked if hed look at it there was no opening in city the program was struggling
6113819 it took on the connotation of more than a request it took on the connotation this is something we need to do
6113820 paul hubbert and i have been friends and political allies for 40 years he didnt call me often when he did call it was important to him dr hubbert didnt ask for many things i knew he was an important political ally as we sought to get our budget funding he would get votes together in the legislature as we would gather votes together in the legislature
6113821 work out employment but wanted assurances we would fund the city program and i gave him that assurance
6113822 was complaining to her sue schmitz did not show up for work didnt show up at all and i asked the president and director to make sure she understood the policies
6113823 first off sue schmitz was never assigned to the huntsville alabama office she didnt have a person to whom she was reporting in huntsville she was assigned to ed earnest operating out of pelham talladega she had no real obligation to be in the huntsville office
6113824 never had a session with her never went anywhere with her never gave her an opportunity
6113825 well every day im a t the legislature im working for the city program
6113826 did not seem to understand her work in the legislature couldnt substitute for her work in the city program
6113827 these progress reports the timesheets the logs are a shambles filled out different ways at different offices
6113828 i want to talk from my heart about timesheets i dont think she put down one bit of time she didnt work
6113829 youve got to report it that way everybody does 8 hours a day five days a week
6113830 there was a mistake in judgment it is an honest mistake in judgment and does not turn it timesheet issue into a crime
6113831 every one of them some of the timesheets the workers in the office filled out for the employees and then they came in and signed them
6113832 i gave mr palmer two instructions first you have my full support to act as director and i expect you to second if ms schmitz continues not to be in compliance he should be in writing to her and that would be the first step in a disciplinary process
6113833 directed him to follow up again in writing to ms schmitz about being in compliance with our policy
6113834 in my initial meeting with them i was probably less than truthful and less than forthcoming in that meeting
6113835 when it came to family matters i was more protective of my family and children than i should have been
6113836 my children i was trying to protect them at age 63 i have admitted publicly my failings if i have an opportunity to live out any part of my life with my wife and family ill consider myself blessed
6113837 expect a visit from sue schmitz he said she was going to come see me because she was going to need to change jobs
6113838 id be glad to help i met with richard lindsay chairman of education appropriations committee
6113839 met with lindsay to effect change in the budget because she asked me and paul hubbert asked me
6113840 i said to him johnson i said if that job was provided i would do my best to provide funding
6113841 i cant honestly say that she sought that position but i knew that she got it
6113842 i hadnt thought about that in five years i was trying to remember i certainly dont recall saying get yourself a job and well get you some money in the budget
6113843 ill admit i hadnt thought about it for a long time
6113844 they could no longer stomach how the civilians were killed so they surrendered
6113845 they made it appear that the milfs programs are good but theyre not because they kill people
6113846 these men will disprove bravos claim that he was not involved in the incident they saw him he was really the one who led the attack
6113847 he bravo said he wasnt in kolambugan of course not he was in kauswagan ordering his men to kill the civilians
6113848 these are the least guilty we can even use them as state witnesses against bravo they will prove what bravo did
6113849 we could have easily been 2 2 if we had

6113873 it was icy i fell down three times i had bruises all over my legs but i kept going because i believe in his message
6113874 i believe in what he has to offer america as a young person i wasnt just going to sit back and watch it all go by
6113875 but if he puts huckabee on the ticket he gets my money and he gets my physical labor
6113876 if youre willing to laugh at a candidate onstage thats a really deep personal affront

6113884 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6113885 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6113886 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6113887 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6113888 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6113889 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6113890 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6113891 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6113892 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

6113902 many of the challenges we identified in the study are widespread throughout the nonprofit sector including issues associated with government contract compliance managing and monitoring cash flow and accurately budgeting for the full costs of programs
6113903 in the hal lab we work with a range of athletes and sports people to measure and record the dynamic data as the foot moves across a special computerised plate like a doormat on the floor
6113904 gathering and analysing the moving foot data of rowers presented an extra challenge for us
6113905 the data was then analysed and the results discussed with each rower and their support team so that they could make adjustments to the foot beds of their shoes to enable them to get optimum force distribution and magnitude when rowing
6113906 this system gave gb rowing something they didnt have before they were able to quantify the equality of the force each rower was producing and the quality of the force is intrinsic to their speed and success this information can also help to protect athletes against lower limb injury for example if the foot is rolling in it will affect the knees
6113907 the dynamic insoles retrain the way the foot functions once the athletes start wearing the insoles this helps to retrain the way they load the weight in the foot over time this helps to relieve symptoms caused by uneven foot pressure and muscle misalignment and can help to prevent further injuries the technology is not unique but our expertise in interpreting the data is crucial to making this technology useful to the athletes
6113908 in the past we used to make insoles by hand from a plaster cast of the foot but this new software gives us much more information because we know how the foot is being used in motion and how the pressure is being loaded this enables us to design a much more accurate insole using the computer software

6113938 we will see another round of consolidation among these contract providers
6113939 several of our clients are already concerned about supplier power from the mega tier and niche providers
6113940 we have a couple of targets on our radar including medical aerospace and other niche areas
6113941 if there is a new wave of consolidation its most likely to be between leading firms
6113942 what may also take place is that the smaller firms may move into branded contract manufacturing business or other businesses in aligned industries
6113943 maybe in some mature industries well begin to see this consolidation happening
6113944 but for the notebook pc industry its not likely just yet as its still growing fast
6113945 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6113946 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6113947 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6113948 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6113949 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6113950 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost

6114175 modest outcome of the emergency meeting reflected divisions within the alliance over responding to the russian invasion
6114176 some european powers such as germany have favored restraint anxious not to aggravate the crisis and jeopardize their energy supplies from russia
6114177 former soviet bloc governments have advocated a tougher stance anxious to deter the kremlin from believing that it can reimpose its influence over its former empire
6114178 struggled to come up with concrete steps to force a defiant moscow to end its 11 day occupation of its smaller neighbor even as russian troops seized prisoners and u s military humvees
6114179 failed to agree on any specific punitive measures despite pressure from the united states that nato at least threaten russia with unspecified consequences and pleas from the czech republic poland and natos baltic members that it take a tough stand
6114180 empty words thats how moscow glibly dismissed natos criticism yesterday of russias continued occupation of georgia the russians may be bullies but like all bullies they know weakness when they see it

6114196 also demanded russian action to end human rights violations in areas of georgia occupied by its troops

6114280 it appears right now that he had a holiday planned here
6114281 the detective working that case was passing out internet safety information in the park and larsson showed up to attend national night out
6114282 august 6th a meeting was arranged for the purpose of sex and it was at a location in fayetteville at a local business and officers arrived set up surveillance and located the suspect and placed him under arrest
6114283 he was actually communicating in rogers at the public library
6114284 theres really no difference as far as the law is concerned
6114285 they were looking for an actual child though so it is a big deal just because it wasnt doesnt mean it isnt you know this time it wasnt a child next time it may be
6114286 is he going to let her leave is he going to take her with him you know whats he going to do after that you know are you going to have a kidnapping with it you just dont know the potential danger is high
6114287 crime has gotten worse as the years go by we hear too much of it now
6114288 if it was possible not to get in trouble would you think about having sex with me
6114289 jim calhoun county sheriff department you are under arrest put your hands on the counter and dont get stupid
6114290 he appeared at a mcdonalds with the intent to meet someone he believed to be a 13 year old girl
6114291 and start a chain of events which would end in a sexual act
6114292 he was foolish enough to use his own identifiers on his yahoo account
6114293 she allowed him to control the direction of the conversations
6114294 a kiss can be considered sexual gratification of a person
6114295 we werent in the position to be able to wait before the school year started to take action
6114296 i would like to move this quickly because this is not something healthy for the community and so the faster we get it adjudicated the better
6114297 but if it wasnt for this investigation there may have been a real one
6114298 i knew when he wouldnt tell me his name and he wouldnt tell me who he was
6114299 sexual predators are not just grooming that one person they are grooming a whole bunch of people sexual predators are looking for different ones they are probably contacting four or five different ones and hoping one will give in
6114300 if you have some sicko thats preying on your child what do you do you have to protect your kids its your job as a parent
6114301 when it occurs in that age group its usually a shock to the patient and the news itself is more devastating than it is in the older women
6114302 its mostly because these are women with young children and their first concern is whats going to happen to my child
6114303 some of them are worried about losing their breasts but more of them are very concerned about getting the disease cured and being there for their families
6114304 it was outside the area of my self breast exam almost on my ribs
6114305 the pain kept nagging me and nagging me which was unusual because they say breast cancer doesnt hurt that was a gift from god that it was hurting because it kept me on it
6114306 they did my biopsy on a tuesday and on wednesday when i got home my mama had taken a phone call that dr tatum wanted to talk to me and it was him on the phone so she was fit to be tied
6114307 i knew my next step was going to be to decide what to do about it whether to have a lumpectomy a mastectomy or what i was going to do
6114308 i just said go on and take them both because i figured at my age there was a good chance it was going to recur
6114309 that was ok with me all that was superficial to me ive got my life and my children as long as i was healthy to take care of them thats all that mattered
6114310 i did have bilateral reconstruction and trust me i have much better results than i had before after breastfeeding three children
6114311 more and more women are coming to the surgeon once theyve been diagnosed with breast cancer and saying i want both my breasts removed
6114312 we also evaluate every breast cancer case in our multi disciplinary breast cancer conference so each womans care and treatment plan is individualized
6114313 with my breast cancer patients im on call to them 24 hours a day if they have a concern or problem im just a phone call away
6114314 im reading a course by bernie schaeffer is it a waste of time
6114315 its unfortunate this designation was made because i have a lot of outstanding questions that have yet to be answered based on williams hearing statements as well as my previous oversight of the gsa
6114316 i handled that uh thing you asked me to handle
6114317 you know the thing for the case you asked me to take care of it
6114318 i mean she doesnt know yet but i did ask i just thought youd want to know
6114319 but during our marriage did i ever show any indication at all that i might not be entirely you know straight
6114320 i never noticed any signs that you were anything other than straight when we were married
6114321 i dont know what it is you think you are seeing but cindy and i theres nothing i mean were friends but thats all
6114322 im just surprised i actually thought she was more than an indication thats why i deferred to you on using her as a decoy i thought you had a right to decide whether or not we put your girlfriend in danger

6114352 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6114353 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6114354 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
6114355 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
6114356 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
6114357 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar
6114358 though the ministers unwarranted remark has not lowered our respect for the state or its people it merits to be denounced and an apology from naik would be in place biharis are not not beggars but have earned respect and status and done our state proud through sheer merit and hard work

6114364 bishop ryan engaged in sexual misconduct with adults and used his authority to conceal this misconduct
6114365 priest role gave erickson cover hints of violence trailed devout man
6114366 my son was 14 and all the kids ran around together it was pretty obvious to me that he was gay he talked constantly about becoming a priest and i just assumed it was because he didnt want to come out to his parents how do i know he was gay his attitude toward girls for one thing he was a good looking kid and the girls were always flirting with him but he wouldnt have anything to do with them which i can tell you is quite unusual for an 18 year old boy

6114382 he was in orgys sic and would always get drunk
6114383 figured out that erickson was grooming him for more than being a good christian

6114385 chickened out on the and part of what we were talking about
6114386 showed no emotion and was not in the least bit sympathetic
6114387 stopped by the police they would think that it was tom oconnell
6114388 his humor sometimes hides aggression or hostility when his joking around becomes

6114452 pienso que ani producto de la sensaci n de p rdida que debe estar viviendo se sinti motivada para decir esto pero creo que ayer ella subi un mensaje a la red donde pide que mejor no se haga la marcha
6114453 el apoyo se puede externar a trav s de otros medios como internet y sobre todo por el cuidado de los ni os
6114454 es indudable que el p blico busca la manera de externar su cari o y apoyo a los rbd pero creo que se debe reconsiderar la opci n podr an ponerse en riesgo todos los involucrados y no es la forma de lograr que el grupo permanezca el resultado ser a una histeria total
6114455 se defini en conjunto el grupo lo platic conmigo no lo determinaron unos cuantos ellos expresaron su deseo por continuar creciendo en solitario y atender asuntos personales
6114456 es el resultado de la emoci n que genera dejar un grupo tan importante que logr cautivar a la gente de una manera tan especial
6114457 la ventas van muy bien lo que est sucediendo no ser a real en caso de que ellos no tuvieran el xito que mantienen hay una p gina en la que se est n recolectando firmas para que el grupo no se desintegre y rebasan los tres millones esa reacci n mundial es un apoyo definitivo de los fans

6114479 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6114480 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6114481 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6114482 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6114483 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6114484 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6114485 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6114486 they want to know what were going to do about it
6114487 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6114488 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6114489 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6114490 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6114491 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6114492 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6114493 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
6114494 overall impacts of exploration and production are reduced because fewer wells are required to develop the same amount of reserves
6114495 our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6114496 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
6114497 when i asked her to sit on my jacket and draw with crayons at the barney auditions
6114498 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
6114499 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
6114500 im committed to finding ways to improve compliance and reduce taxpayer burden so that we begin to bridge the tax gap which accounts for 345 billion in legally owed but uncollected federal revenues each year
6114501 shows yet again the need for full fledged tax reform next year
6114502 we are constantly reviewing the tax code to find ways to crack down on those who are trying to avoid paying their fair share without placing undue compliance or reporting burdens on honest taxpayers as part of this on going effort we are reviewing the gao report to see what it might suggest about where to target tax gap efforts

6114522 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6114523 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6114524 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6114525 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6114526 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6114527 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6114528 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6114529 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6114530 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6114531 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked

6114536 its not about protecting the beattie government it is just a genuine belief that this is a very significant set of reforms that weve struck the right balance
6114537 it will be the most open in the country and its fair enough to start it from the day of the act
6114538 this decision means anna bligh will be nearly 70 years old before the people of queensland find out what she and her cabinet have been getting up to today
6114539 we think this is clearly a constitutional revision essentially a new constitution
6114540 you cant tie all the disparate issues together put them under one umbrella and say to voters take it or leave it
6114541 i hope the court realizes that courts should not act as traffic cops between the people and the ballot
6114542 the people have a right to put a proposal on the ballot without the court vetoing that proposal before the voters get a shot at it we allow people to propose multiple purpose amendments and we trust the voters to sort things out they dont need it spoon fed to them one proposal at a time
6114543 taxpayers from all across michigan are demanding change to how michigans broken government operates michigan taxpayers clearly want the opportunity to vote on this proposal in november the political establishment and judges with conflicts of interests since their salaries would be cut should not stand in the way of michigan citizens right to vote

6114575 social experience has an impact on how people look at faces
6114576 westerners focus analytically on salient objects by contrast people from china korea and japan focus more holistically on relationships and similarities among objects
6114577 the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms
6114578 psychologists and philosophers have long assumed that while culture impacts on the way we think about the world basic perceptual mechanisms are common among humans we provide evidence that social experience and cultural factors shape human eye movements for processing faces which contradicts that view

6114581 i never said that biharis are beggars instead i said that the beggars from outside state usually come here by train and had referred to starting of a train from patna i did not mean that biharis are beggars
6114582 laloo prasad yadav had called me and was asking about the reported statement i clarified to him that the statement was not anti bihari and was misunderstood by the media
6114583 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar
6114584 we had sought clarification on the issue on the floor itself when naik uttered it i dont agree with his statement maximum numbers of ias officers are from bihar
6114585 resistance is futile your culture and technology will be assimilated als de chinezen willen hebben ze t over 10 jaar voor t zeggen en t zijn r zoveel dus t kan
6114586 i am very pleased with this game i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball
6114587 you see in the second half the rhythm was a little bit broken we were not as good as in the first half but thats normal if you change two or three players and then two more
6114588 overall i can only be very pleased with the performance the mentality and attitude of the players and i can only look forward to the training camp in september in the netherlands
6114589 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6114590 they say you dont truly miss something or know how much it meant to you until its gone or taken away from you and i have missed it
6114591 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
6114592 i have been away for a very long time so the excitement and profile of where the game is at is very different for me
6114593 without being disrespectful to past players or past leagues from what i remember soccer in australia appears to be a different type of event
6114594 soccer in australia has obviously progressed a long long way and im just happy to be part of it
6114595 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
6114596 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
6114597 if i can lose another five kilos i will have a real opportunity to see within myself how close i can get to back to where i was
6114598 i feel like i am making progress every day the goalkeeper coach john crawley has been excellent with me and also working with all those young boys it puts a fire back in the belly
6114599 its time for me to put something back not only into football but into the community and using the experiences i have had to help people less fortunate than me
6114600 and ill continue to do that because i think i have a duty and a responsibility to do that
6114601 its good to use your bad experiences for a positive
6114602 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6114603 el nadador norteamericano recibe 50 ofrecimientos publicitarios diarios los expertos aseguran que deber ser m s carism tico para mantenerse hace cosas que le llaman la atenci n a la gente o es de esos deportistas que se dan por satisfechos con sus xitos y no quieren seguir en el candelero
6114604 bursts of analyst departures in a hot research area is not unusual
6114605 they have been playing an attacking expansive type of game and i think theyll keep going with that
6114606 it is up to us to make sure we are on our game with our defensive policies and that sort of thing
6114607 if there is any opportunity for turnovers or things like that we can hopefully sting them back
6114608 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at fullback in terms of counter attack and turn over ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
6114609 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try and get involved and get a few mismatches
6114610 jimmy horwill and rocky both trained fully so the key now will be how they respond to that
6114611 they had a scrummaging session which is the first one theyve had as well so the fact that theyre out here and doing it is good it means theres a chance but the key will be how they report after that
6114612 we dont want to set it back so that they then need an operation weve got to be sensible about it because theres still footy to come
6114613 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months
6114614 fall camp it becomes so routine that you dont know which day it is
6114615 i think we can at least change our focus a bit to somebody else and that will provide a little more excitement around here
6114616 they each add a little bit of a different dimension
6114617 good i can just buy a 790i ftw and a penryn and be on my way

6114625 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
6114626 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
6114627 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
6114628 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
6114629 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
6114630 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
6114631 the big difference is that we now have a specialist full time scrum coach in michael foley who has been working with us for the past 18 months

6114635 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
6114636 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session
6114637 we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve definitely
6114638 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
6114639 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
6114640 were now a team deep enough that if a harrys missing or a timmy missing or a duke is missing weve got people who can fill in
6114641 me and scotty do alright together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
6114642 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
6114643 i know what they can do and what they cant

6114662 but we do need to be more accurate at the breakdown situation
6114663 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6114664 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6114665 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me

6114676 i certainly dont want to be a passenger i want to get out there and really be involved
6114677 i want to have an impact for me i like having ball in hand and attacking with it so if i can do that then i will be happy
6114678 i played in 2005 a fair bit and then none in 2006 so certainly the confidence took a bit of a hit
6114679 but to be able to come back in 2007 and especially at the world cup and perform at the biggest stage i came away with a lot of confidence and took that into the super 14
6114680 at the same time it means nothing if you dont continue on with it so it is just seeking that consistency which i guess has eluded me somewhat in the early stages of my career
6114681 the times you play well but you back it up with a game thats not so good it is an experience you can come away with and look at perhaps why that happened

6114688 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6114689 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6114690 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6114691 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6114692 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6114695 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6114697 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6114698 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6114959 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6114960 my concern was he would not have the ability to hold that speed for the entire race but he showed he has been working on that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record

6114994 scheffer ist weder balte noch pole geh rt also nicht zu den nationen die von moskau einer irrationalen russophobie bezichtigt werden scheffer hat einfach den worten ihr gewicht wieder gegeben er erinnerte daran dass drohungen einer raketenattacke ausgesprochen von einem ranghohen offizier eines staates der zu den wichtigsten demokratischen l ndern geh ren m chte nicht normal sind sowohl jaap de hoop scheffer als auch rice haben die beunruhigenden tendenzen beim namen genannt das ist gut so denn gerade die devaluierung der worte in der diplomatie hat den kreml ermuntert von seiner arroganten rhetorik zur politik der panzer berzugehen nur dass harte worte immer noch keine konsequenzen in der situation in georgien haben die russischen panzer fahren immer noch ber georgischen boden wenn der westen kein wirksames druckmittel findet um die russen zum r ckzug zu zwingen wird sein ansehen stark leiden denn worte allein auch die st rksten reichen hier nicht
6114995 die nato wird ihrer aufgabe gerecht das b ndnis hat in br ssel trotz aller meinungsverschiedenheiten mit einer stimme gesprochen entschieden jedoch nicht provokativ kritisierte die nato den kreml f r die verletzung internationalen rechts und die unverh ltnism ige gewaltanwendung die nato erkl rte wiederholt dass georgien und die ukraine eines tages dem transatlantischen b ndnis beitreten werden wir wissen noch nicht wann dies geschieht und unter welchen bedingungen aber es z hlt allein die tatsache dass niemand im westen das beitrittsversprechen zur ckgenommen hat und das obwohl moskau der welt brutal vor augen gef hrt hat dass es seinen einfluss im kaukasus mit allen mitteln verteidigt
6114996 die entwicklung in georgien hat in estland erneut die frage aufkommen lassen w rde uns die nato im verteidigungsfall tats chlich zu hilfe kommen sicherlich ist georgien noch kein mitglied aber s dossetien mit seinen 70 000 einwohnern war es laut verklausulierten aussagen aus den usa ohnehin nicht wert einen dritten weltkrieg zu beginnen da muss man sich schon fragen wie gro ein land sein muss damit die nato interveniert wie w rde russland heute reagieren wenn estland und die anderen baltischen staaten jetzt der nato beitreten wollten seien wir froh dass dies bereits passiert ist aber das beantwortet noch nicht die noch wichtigere frage ob man uns zur hilfe kommen w rde die klausel dass im verteidigungsfall alle mitgliedsl nder f reinander einstehen m ssen ist noch nicht auf die probe gestellt worden aber u erungen aus den usa zufolge ist s dossetien mit seinen 70 000 einwohnern kein grund f r einen dritten weltkrieg dann m sste man freilich fragen ab wann ein land gro genug f r eine intervention ist
6114997 vor dem gestrigen sondertreffen war viel von einem wendepunkt die rede gewesen und davon dass man die beziehungen zu russland grunds tzlich berdenken m sse alles was dann in br ssel herauskam war die ank ndigung dass die beratungen mit moskau im gemeinsamen nato russland rat bis zum abzug der russischen truppen ausgesetzt w rden normalerweise ist man solch schwammige windelweiche reaktionen vom eu au enpolitik beauftragten solana gewohnt aber inzwischen scheint auch die nato schon weitgehend solanisiert die russen selbst haben schon vor der georgien krise wiederholt klargemacht was sie vom nato russland rat halten n mlich so gut wie nichts eine quasselbude seis halt in der man ein bisschen ins denken und tun der westlichen allianz reinhorchen kann ohne sich selbst zu allzu viel verpflichten zu m ssen aber wie weit ist es eigentlich noch von der solanisierung zur schr derisierung der nato der deutsche ex kanzler schr der des kremls treuester propagandist im westen hat dem spiegel gerade erkl rt dass von russland nicht die geringste gefahr ausgehe und das land im westen einfach nur falsch wahrgenommen werde ja ja das ist europas lichte zukunft la schr der wir werden alle gazprom angestellte h ren radio moskau und plappern brav jede kreml parole nach
6114998 die nato hat es nicht einfach es gibt keine einigkeit dar ber wie man handeln soll russland muss eine reaktion zu sp ren bekommen und diese reaktion muss scharf sein sagt das eine lager nicht sehr klug sagen die anderen und weisen auf die konomischen verbindungen hin die debatte gleicht mehr dem sicherheitsrat der vereinten nationen als einem milit rischen b ndnis entwickelt sich die nato zu noch einem internationalen diskussionsklub es sieht danach aus wenn eine organisation wie die osze als beschlussf hig und relevant in einem politischen konflikt erscheint ist es definitiv an der zeit die nato mit neuen augen zu sehen nicht mehr als verteidigungsversicherungsorganisation aber vielleicht als organisation die personal und material f r missionen au erhalb der eigenen grenzen zur verf gung stellt f r uns schweden sollte das der ideale klub sein denn die gegenseitigen zusicherungen nach dem motto der musketiere einer f r alle alle f r einen haben uns bisher abgeschreckt
6114999 das m chtigste milit rb ndnis der welt will nicht mit handfesten ma nahmen auf die russische machtdemonstration in georgien reagieren das ist keine spektakul re aber eine kluge entscheidung noch ist nicht wirklich klar was russland mit dem einmarsch in georgien erreichen wollte russland hat sich bei aller brutalen machtanwendung letztlich im zaum gehalten tiflis wurde nicht besetzt die strategisch wichtigen lpipelines nicht angetastet moskau wei dass es seine eigenen gro en wirtschaftlichen interessen im westen aufs spiel setzt wenn es diese selbst provozierte krise eskalieren l sst auch aus diesem grund w re es falsch gewesen jetzt mit harten ma nahmen russland in die isolation zu dr ngen
6115000 das waffenstillstandsabkommen ist damit eine farce weitere ultimaten gegen ber russland w rden aber nur schaden die nato kriegsschiffe sollten dennoch so lange im schwarzen meer bleiben bis die russen tats chlich abgezogen sind und die organisation f r sicherheit und zusammenarbeit in europa sollte darauf bestehen die russischen friedenstruppen in der region durch eigene zu ersetzen eu und nato m ssen zudem klare mechanismen vereinbaren um russland zu isolieren falls es den r ckzug noch weiter hinausz gert
6115001 in den usa sowie in mittel und osteuropa w chst nicht nur die antirussische stimmung sondern auch die kritik an westeuropa f r emp rung sorgt hier auch das spiegel interview von deutschlands ex kanzler schr der darin erkl rte er beispielsweise der westen sei dabei im konflikt um s dossetien gro e fehler zu begehen da war es nur richtig dass kanzlerin merkel gegen ber der welt ffentlichkeit klargemacht hat wer in deutschland heute das sagen hat
6115002 wie soll man mit einem revanchistischen revisionistischen und nach sowjetmanier imperialistisch agierenden russland umgehen sicherlich nicht im stil des kalten krieges das instrument der abschreckung ist auf beiden seiten stumpf geworden durchaus auch zum nachteil f r die allianz denn wer sich vor den russen nicht zu tode f rchtet ist schwieriger auf eine gemeinsame linie einzuschw ren
6115003 die direkten sch den des kaukasus konfliktes belaufen sich auf mehrere milliarden rubel von den indirekten auswirkungen und dem image verlust ganz zu schweigen die ann herung der ukraine und georgiens an die nato wird nun m glicherweise beschleunigt saakaschwili bleibt an der macht es drohen ein zerfall der gus und eine verschlechterung der beziehungen zur eu m glicherweise verliert russland nicht nur die chance auf einen wto beitritt sondern auch die zusage die olympischen winterspiele 2014 in sotschi ausrichten zu d rfen es ist an der zeit zu fragen wozu war das alles n tig der krieg in georgien ist ein weiterer beweis daf r dass fehlende pressefreiheit und die abgehobenheit der f hrung russland teuer zu stehen kommen wenn nicht bald eine wirkliche demokratisierung stattfindet k nnte der in jeder hinsicht verlustreiche krieg gegen georgien nicht der letzte und nicht der gr te fehler der russischen f hrung gewesen sein
6115004 nach dem kriegsausbruch im kaukasus fragten sich viele westliche medien ist das der anfang eines neuen kalten krieges wird der westen russland nun isolieren von beidem kann keine rede sein allein schon aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen verflechtungen ist eine frontale auseinandersetzung der beiden gro m chte nicht denkbar die situation ist ganz anders als zu zeiten des kalten krieges und auch eine isolation russlands ist seit der ra putin unm glich man darf in gespr chen von internationaler bedeutung moskau nicht mehr bergehen die usa k nnen russland nicht so behandeln wie jugoslawien oder den irak

6115021 as a physician i can assure you that the care that was delivered to these patients was good clinically appropriate high quality patient care
6115022 statistical process intended to level the playing field by accounting for health risks that patients have before they enter the hospital
6115023 the numbers in this report dont accurately reflect the good care that was given to these patients because the way the charts were documented and coded didnt accurately translate into the complicated medicare language let me again emphasize that the disappointing data you are seeing is all paperwork not reflective of our excellent patient care
6115024 weve invested significant resources in a new documentation system and manpower to adjust our clinical documentation process in order to help the physicians and other caregivers understand how to phrase their documentation in a way that is consistent with the medicare coding rules
6115025 next years report may not reflect all the changes weve worked so earnestly to incorporate these last 12 months because those new processes went into full function in february of this year and that will affect a little less than half the reporting time period for the 2009 report however we feel that the changes weve made will be reflected in upcoming reports by cms
6115026 we are just a volunteer group of upperclassmen who take the new students on the weekend orientation trips after we help them get ready during welcome week

6115031 the distance is a little bit of a worry but this my second one to go to college so im a little more relaxed this time around
6115032 it really does help you because you have an entire week before you attend classes to get to know people so when you come back from your trip you can have someone to hang out with or sit beside in the cafeteria
6115033 it really just helps develop a network among hendrix colleagues so if you have a problem you know exactly who to go to
6115034 the new students seem really excited and its just been great to see new faces on campus
6115035 we have also done different sessions where students get to meet their advisors and what we call academic families so they know that those are the people teaching in their majors and those are some of the people they may have class with
6115036 thats really the most important thing because when they connect with somebody we more than likely can keep them here
6115037 and its good because when class starts on thursday they have a little confidence coming back
6115038 i think the students are having a wonderful time and really getting acclimated to the university its a huge transition and i think the staff has done an excellent job helping them feel comfortable being at college and being a part of the university
6115039 ive had a couple of students who approached us saying they want to go home but then my staff made them feel comfortable and let them know there are people here who care about them

6115054 dont forget the poor i may not be there but the poor are still there
6115055 i never met a man who led a life so close to the one christ asked believers to lead in his selflessness humility and abiding devotion lucious lived his faith in a way we lesser people can only hope to approach we can say with complete assurance he has entered through the narrow gate and walks among the saints

6115093 fpl well represents a model of true integration in health benefit design
6115094 the approach is employee centered not program centered all five elements are managed as an integrated whole and it is the clearest way an employer can communicate that its employees are an asset
6115095 the approach is to take care of the complete individual

6115144 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

6115218 los recientes triunfos de las mujeres me motivaron a saber que se pueden lograr cosas grandes como dices hac a 24 a os que un var n no ganaba oro es un buen momento para que tanto los varones como las mujeres nos demos cuenta de que se puede lograr lo que te propongas
6115219 llegar ahora en esta madurez a mis 28 a os de edad es algo que disfrut que so espero que la delegaci n mexicana se motive y se den cuenta que m xico es un pa s grande que puede lograr cosas grandes espero que los dem s se motiven que sue en que los sue os se hacen realidad
6115220 al estar en el podio y escuchar el himno era un sue o hecho realidad la piel se me erizaba gracias a toda la gente que me ayud
6115221 nos pasaron por arriba no hay mucha explicaci n que dar fueron y son ampliamente superiores
6115222 cuando ten s un c rner tan bueno como el de ellas y uno no capitaliza las oportunidades que tiene esto es lo que sucede
6115223 creo que no hay mucho para decir ellas en todo momento fueron superiores aprovecharon cada espacio nuestro cada error nuestro y ah estuvo la diferencia
6115224 esto a n no termina todav a tenemos que pelear por el bronce porque es muy distinto volver a casa con las manos vac as que volver con un bronce
6115225 los africanos llegan y toman otras nacionalidades por lo que la competencia es muy complicada cada d a es m s dif cil entrar en reuniones atl ticas todos los lugares quedan reservados para ellos
6115226 desde el mundial de osaka a ahora se ha puesto m s dif cil disputar estas pruebas
6115227 incluso en espa a vemos ya que hay atletas de origen africano que compiten bajo su bandera
6115228 me quer a meter a las finales pero un momento pens respir y agarr nimo para lograr una medalla de bronce y meterme en el podio

6115233 ya se vuelve la sombra negra de los albinegros ya que el a o pasado lo elimin en la primera ronda
6115234 con una victoria por 1 a 0 en la revancha marcada para el martes 26 en asunci n
6115235 perdi por sus propios errores no fue menos y en varios pasajes del partido super a su similar uruguayo pero no cont con dos traicioneras fallas en el fondo de su defensa
6115236 libertad cay ante el defensor y definir su clasificaci n en casa
6115237 dunga no deber a salir por causa de los errores cometidos en ese partido brasil perder a con cualquier entrenador l deber a salir porque brasil posee otros entrenadores superiores y con m s experiencia
6115238 ricardo teixeira presidente de la confederaci n brasile a de f tbol que convoc a ronaldinho ga cho para atender intereses comerciales deber a ahora atender las peticiones de la mayor a de los hinchas que quiere a otro t cnico para la selecci n principal desde los ltimos partidos de las eliminatorias mundialistas
6115239 dunga volvi a repetir esa estrategia y no obtuvo resultados los tres volantes que se destacan por llegar por llegar bien al ataque actuaron apenas como marcadores como los volantes de la selecci n principal
6115240 fue un error m o me pas la cuenta el cansancio
6115241 me pas la cuenta fue un error grav simo m o no haber parado y no utilizar los recursos que se tiene para llegar hasta el final
6115242 perd la noci n fue todo muy r pido los botes estaban muy cerca me llevaron a la ambulancia y de ah no me acuerdo
6115243 desvaneci por estar demasiado exhausta es una mezcla de calor de cansancio y de deshidrataci n una descompensaci n general
6115244 no tuvo nada que ver con la intensidad de la prueba aparte de que la primera parte fue muy lenta
6115245 la consigna era no pensar en italia hasta ma ana
6115246 hemos jugado bien centrados y comenzando fuerte los tres sets era lo que hab amos hablado que nadie pensara en italia hasta ma ana creo que lo hemos conseguido
6115247 los partidos de cuartos de final siempre son traicioneros por eso no quer amos sorpresas no pod amos permitir que china nos sorprendiera y de ah la importancia de comenzar ganando todos los sets para evitar que el rival se creciera
6115248 por ese motivo nuestra defensa era fundamental para dejarles sin propuestas ofensiva y facilitarnos el trabajo la defensa fue un detalle importante hoy
6115249 respetamos mucho a italia profundamente tiene grandes jugadores y a un gran entrenador como andrea anastasi ser un duro partido sin duda
6115250 sabemos que si afrontamos la calidad t cnica de brasil f sicamente tenemos que estar al m ximo pero no lo estamos aunque ellos tampoco
6115251 acabamos de jugar cinco partidos en 12 d as y eso es mucho con muchos viajes y con este calor
6115252 est desgastado f sicamente eso est claro porque no tenemos mucha rotaci n y hemos jugado a menudo con el mismo equipo as que ese es uno de nuestros puntos d biles contra brasil
6115253 va a ser m s dif cil para nosotros que para ellos
6115254 cuando saltas a un terreno de juego es para ganar el partido as que vamos a empezar con esa misma ambici n y a defender nuestras oportunidades vamos a hacer el m ximo por obtener esa medalla
6115255 est claro que brasil es un gran equipo ya lo sab amos antes del torneo y lo hay demostrado durante los juegos
6115256 ser un partido muy dif cil para nosotros pero a partir del momento en que estamos entre los cuatro mejores del mundo autom ticamente se juega contra un adversario de gran calidad como era el caso de nigeria que les venci 4 1 en semifinales y es el caso de brasil pero tambi n es el caso de b lgica
6115257 y no s si va a jugar con su mejor equipo o si lo har n otros jugadores
6115258 cuando juegas una semifinal s lo quieres llegar a la final y luchar por la primera plaza pero cuando no lo consigues hay una gran decepci n sobre todo cuando hab a una enorme ambici n en el equipo para clasificarse as que hay que trabajar mentalmente con el equipo
6115259 est claro que si al principio nos hubieran dicho que bamos a jugar en semifinales todos los belgas habr an firmado enseguida y con ambas manos porque ha sido un resultado extraordinario
6115260 aunque si se observa nuestra calidad de juego creo que nuestro lugar en la semifinal es l gico y merecido
6115261 salvo contra nigeria cuando nos falt eficacia en los momentos claves del partido hemos hecho siempre el partido que hac a falta contra adversarios de calidad y de estilo diferente y cada vez hemos sabido adaptarnos y encontrar la soluci n correcta para ganar
6115262 hemos salido a jugar el partido porque no puedes jugar contra china y pensar en italia en principio ramos superiores a ellos pero hab a que demostrarlo
6115263 china es un equipo con mucha movilidad y hay que estar muy atentos para evitar que te sorprendan por lo dem s no ha sido un partido dif cil ha sido un encuentro de cuartos de final un poco at pico
6115264 italia es un gran equipo y sobresale especialmente en ataque y bloqueo sus jugadores tienen mucha experiencias en partidos importantes y saben manejar la presi n y jugar con el resultado va a ser un partido muy igualado
6115265 jaha jag trodde att det var den andra motorcykeln som var stulen
6115266 ser a un orgullo vencer a los vigentes campeones ol mpicos
6115267 le pas factura la novatez en este tipo de competencias y le dice adi s a la sudamericana en un abrir y cerrar de ojos
6115268 con un f tbol pr ctico y efectivo mostr por qu es el actual campe n de la copa sudamericana
6115269 s lo un milagro los puede salvar en el juego de vuelta
6115270 ninguno de nuestros afiliados se va hacer presente ante una convocatoria
6115271 creo que eso es un paso natural espero estar en el pr ximo marat n
6115272 nos pasaron por arriba no hay mucha explicaci n que dar fueron y son ampliamente superiores
6115273 he corrido bien y a pesar de que no me he clasificado me voy contento
6115274 me ve a bien y quise poner un ritmo r pido era la nica forma que ten a de clasificarme
6115275 ahora tengo que pensar en un nuevo ciclo de tres a os para prepararme para londres
6115276 dediqu el gol a gianinna y a toda mi familia que estaban viendo el partido desde casa ellas me a oran mucho
6115277 brasil vio a argentina bailar y dio adi s a su sue o del in dito oro ol mpico con una de sus m s vergonzosas actuaciones convocado para ser la mayor estrella ronaldinho ga cho fue un retrato del equipo ap tico y sin inspiraci n
6115278 el t cnico dunga debe ser mantenido hasta el partido del 7 de septiembre contra chile en santiago pero vanderlei luxemburgo ya habr a sido sondeado para sustituirlo
6115279 el f tbol brasile o cinco veces campe n del mundo comunica el fallecimiento de la selecci n del t cnico dunga ocurrido ayer en pek n
6115280 esta vez el sue o del oro se convirti en lata de la peor manera posible un 3 0 incontestable frente a los eternos rivales argentinos
6115281 que la apretada agenda de la selecci n en los pr ximos meses es su mayor aliada
6115282 a pesar del fracaso en los juegos la confederaci n brasile a de f tbol considera que este no es el momento ideal para cambiar de entrenador ello debido a que ma ana dunga ya tiene que divulgar su lista de convocados para los pr ximos partidos
6115283 el sue o del oro ol mpico acab ayer con la peor de las pesadillas una dura derrota por 3 0 frente a argentina el mayor de los rivales el t cnico dunga vuelve a caminar sobre la cuerda floja
6115284 el t cnico sabe que un tropiezo el 7 de septiembre frente a chile puede poner fin a su ciclo en la selecci n
6115285 brasil juega muy mal y es goleada por argentina ahora s lo resta luchar por el bronce perder frente a argentina no es un resultado normal ser eliminado en juegos ol mpicos ni se habla pero llevar un baile del rival perder por 3 0 y recorrer a la violencia al final de partido es como m nimo estupidez
6115286 dunga dice que no siempre es posible vencer pero perder de esa forma es vergonzoso humillante ultrajante y repulsivo no es vano que once de cada diez brasile os quiere su salida de la selecci n
6115287 bolt hizo la exhibici n m s impresionante que he visto en mi vida tiene una combinaci n letal de velocidad y zancada es una maravilla verlo en carrera aunque tengan que hacerlo desde atr s pronto dir adi s a mi r cord
6115288 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
6115289 dont buy into the hype these stores want you to think that you have to have new clothes to be in and cool well be buying our clothes this year in dribs and drabs
6115290 when john boy walton had to choose between a suit of clothes to wear to graduation or his familys very survival when their cow died i dont think he was worried about a fancy shirt to wear do you
6115291 the waltons didnt need a high falutin mall to shop at
6115292 do you think when jim bob was pinned under the model t car his thought were about what was on his feet
6115293 perhaps well just grab some corn meal grind it down make some bread and cook it on an old fashioned oven like ma walton had to do
6115294 there are things i forgot to tell you are you sure you know where the bathroom is will you tell someone if you feel sick do you remember that ill be at home waiting for you

6115297 ser uma oportunidade para ler conhecer e divulgar a poesia rabe
6115298 importante que as pessoas do mundo especialmente do brasil conhe am o que a poesia rabe porque ela um dos pilares da civiliza o tanto no oriente como no ocidente se ela n o ou parece n o ser uma quest o de tempo para isso temos que trabalhar
6115299 ele foi um dos poetas mais importantes para a poesia em rabe do s culo xx
6115300 vamos utilizar tradu es do rabe para o portugu s feitas por mim pela professora safa jubran e pelos alunos do curso de rabe da usp
6115301 j organizei outros diwans como esse e sempre procuro mesclar a poesia com outras manifesta es culturais para tornar o encontro mais interessante e produtivo

6115303 t cticamente corr bien aunque yo soy nuevo en esto lo di todo en la pista
6115304 no lo olvidar como espero no olvidar el momento en el que cruc la meta cuando fui ol mpico de una vez
6115305 tengo que tratar de correr en 1 46 para poder meterme en la final
6115306 se merece todo por su humildad y por la forma en la que est trabajando
6115307 uno se acuerda de todo eso de c mo se perdi el partido ya sobre la hora
6115308 s que ser un partido dif cil pero estoy confiado porque nosotros estamos bien
6115309 porque la guerra hay que pelearla porque siempre se mantiene la esperanza
6115310 he corrido con miedo de no lastimarme m s estoy muy agradecido a dios porque me haya dado la posibilidad de clasificarme para unos juegos tras un a o muy complicado por las lesiones
6115311 pero estoy satisfecho porque me entregu a la causa de mi pa s
6115312 me alegra que el oro se quede en am rica
6115313 am rica de verdad se merece competir con estas potencias con toda la precariedad que tenemos en nuestra rea
6115314 no me siento derrotado me siento muy contento ya que estaba compitiendo ante un peleador de gran nivel nos conocemos bastante hemos peleado en centroamericanos panamericanos
6115315 siempre dije que confiaba en mi equipo en los j venes que la escuela cubana est por encima de los nombres y no importa los que llegaban a pek n todos ellos iban a luchar por conseguir lo mejor para su pa s
6115316 el boxeo cubano no improvisa se trabaja con seriedad y proyecci n de futuro
6115317 pero todos ellos han demostrado una gran madurez y ahora ha quedado demostrado con los triunfos que hemos logrado hasta llegar a la semifinales
6115318 con la readaptaci n al grupo ahora veo los frutos de haber trabajado todo el verano
6115319 es una operaci n bastante complicada en la que no se puede hablar de plazos
6115320 para nosotros es muy positivo que la l nea de juego sea la misma el entrenador gregorio manzano tiene una idea de juego y el equipo la est respetando m s all de qui n est en el campo a pesar de que se hayan ido jugadores importantes el equipo trata de jugar de la misma forma se est formando un buen grupo
6115321 obviamente para la gente de aqu les gustar a que el propietario sea mallorqu n pero si no hay nadie que desea comprarlo el nuevo mandam s tendr que ser de irak o de donde sea
6115322 en el mallorca no podemos quejarnos de falta de pagos como ha ocurrido en otros clubes
6115323 tal vez ustedes se fijan demasiado en mi expresi n facial durante los juegos pero esa es mi cara para disputar los partidos
6115324 pero al final impusimos nuestro juego no s si hay alg n equipo que pueda resistirnos 40 minutos
6115325 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labour can she serve
6115326 but they can also be taken away at any time
6115327 we have no records of these two names in our system
6115328 this is part of the arsenal of repressive tactics that the government has used to silence dissent
6115329 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6115330 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6115331 the goal is to silence and deter them this goal has been achieved
6115332 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6115333 defending the rights of the people is still such a difficult thing even 60 years after the establishment of the republic
6115334 they often threaten to use environmental laws tighten preconditions and such like as a result traditional companies are actually forced to give up earlier deals you see it happening in russia latin america venezuela the list is goes on and on
6115335 80 percent of reserves are in countries that think that control over their natural resources is more important that existing deals on concessions countries that do not adhere to the western liberal model
6115336 in general it is not the same as countries with a stable middle class with regulated economic activities and industry etc which brings the money into the economy it is not just all kinds of productive things that are done it can actually lead to political conflict between different groups in the population over the control of the state machinery and the income from oil
6115337 with livecommunity six groups has solved the problem of producer consumer interaction
6115338 next08 ha just saw me on a huge monitor twittering along way cool they are showing the next08 hashtag hope it will be on all rooms
6115339 a well used tool by webmasters looking to increase the interactive features of their site and get to know their visitors better
6115340 its small and compact but a very very capable device with great battery life
6115341 some days i feel like shit some days i wanna quit and just be normal for a bit
6115342 we will be submitting additional analyses to usepa to support our position
6115343 we are hopeful that usepa will carefully examine this information and respond accordingly
6115344 is not conducive to completing such additional equity financing and that a consolidation of the companys share capital is required in order to facilitate attracting new equity investment
6115345 no hi ha dubte que la campanya per desacreditar obama est actualment donant li resultats a mccain aquesta s una caiguda significativa per a obama
6115346 to pay lay people albeit briefly trained as stop smoking counsellors for recruiting and spending a few sessions with smokers is an astonishing way to spend public money
6115347 without any checks whatsoever is an extraordinary derogation of responsibility
6115348 this was all driven by the need to meet targets and it is a feature of the target driven culture of the governments of this country that it can lead to the distortion of proper functions and can lead as in this case to the opportunity for fraud
6115349 i have been a successful businessman in my life i have had the porsche had the gold rolex watch and a home in chelsea now all i want to do is help the community
6115350 i know the jury and i and anyone else listening to this case would have been appalled at the cavalier way in which the taxpayers money was dealt with by the kensington and chelsea primary care trust and the positively amateurish way in which the finance department failed to have any sufficient checks on the money it was paying out on the no smoking service
6115351 that allowed a fraud to occur which would have been obvious to anyone on the most superficial inquiry this was not a sophisticated fraud
6115352 the fraud was allowed to continue with the result a large sum of public money designated for health care was lost
6115353 i am not going to name names but the public will be very surprised if there have not been resignations over this matter
6115354 it is extraordinary that no conflict of interest between you as a member of the primary care trust as a volunteer on the board and also as running this scheme was identified
6115355 no one of course can criticise efforts in preventative medicine but this scheme has properly been described by the defence as pseudo medical
6115356 have your agents hook you up with celebrity trainers and clothing companies so that you can adequately look the part
6115357 like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus

6115363 we know argentina is a very experienced team we hope to have a little revenge because they knocked us out in the last olympic tournament in greece in our home
6115364 when you play a team like argentina the first thing no mistakes patience and try to have a clear mind on every pass and every time you defend
6115365 it will be a difficult game they have a lot of players that can change the game everyone of them that means we need a lot of concentration
6115366 i expressed the view that its obviously a critical relationship from new zealands point of view we fully support the work of the current new zealand government in terms of building a single economic market with australia
6115367 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
6115368 when my home burned down back in 1998 i needed some things for myself and i came in and they gave me a voucher they gave me wonderful things to get back on my feet
6115369 theyve got to pay their rent theyve got to pay their gasoline theyve got to pay their electricity and its taking its toll
6115370 everything costs more and im not able to afford to go to retail shops
6115371 when youre coming from a place like i came from your past has a tendency to follow you
6115372 but here it doesnt matter what youve been through or where youve come from
6115373 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6115420 although the seismic is still under examination my preliminary observation is that there are two very large anticlinal structures present in the catchers mitt prospect area that could quite possibly contain over 2 3 tcf of recoverable gas ive seen some areas in alaska that are being drilled based on only 4 or 5 short lines fox was extremely fortunate to get this excellent and comprehensive seismic package of high quality data that is such a perfect fit to their project area
6115421 the 46 000 acre catchers mitt prospect is very exciting with the declining natural gas production and reserves in the cook inlet and the proximity of the catchers mitt to existing infrastructure this project is important to the south central alaskan gas consumers for both its size and ability to access the market quickly
6115422 we are very pleased to receive these preliminary assessments based on the seismic data we were privy to through shell the quality of the seismic helped our geological consultants make an early estimate of what we can expect and we are understandably eager for the drilling season to begin having potential of over two trillion cubic feet of natural gas
6115423 financial institutions government agencies retail businesses and health care organizations are struggling with the dramatic increase in online fraud and identity theft
6115424 the integration of web access management with risk based authentication provides great synergies by enabling organizations to dynamically adapt to evolving threats and improve their compliance posture the use of stronger authentication with web access management can also reduce risk and improve customer confidence
6115425 proving that you are who you say you are is of paramount importance for everyone involved in any online transaction as all industry sectors expand to take advantage of the web and open more applications to customers remote employees contractors and partners it is essential that they have additional capabilities to assure the identity of the individuals requesting access

6115427 the days of simply requiring a user id and password for authentication are numbered as the risk is simply too great

6115503 capital punishment drags victims loved ones through an agonizing and lengthy process holding out the promise of one punishment in the beginning and often resulting in a life sentence in the end anyway
6115504 though we share different perspectives on the death penalty every one of us agrees that marylands capital punishment system doesnt work for victims families and that our state is better off without it

6115521 grave concern regarding complaints we have received from fidelity customers who have purchased auction rate securities that were presented to them as safe liquid principal protected investments and who now find themselves unable to sell those securities
6115522 it is my hope that fidelity will follow the industry trend and promptly repurchase these securities that it has sold to customers

6115524 fidelity does not proactively market auction rate securities or maintain an inventory of these securities we dont run or host auctions we believe the underwriters should stand behind these securities
6115525 we state that one of the risks of purchasing these bonds is failed auctions which can lead to lack of liquidity

6115687 after a winter of discontent the snapping point came while priya venkatesan was lecturing on ecofeminism which holds in part that scientific advancements benefit the patriarchy but leave women out
6115688 ms venkatesan informed her pupils that their behavior was fascist demagoguery then after consulting a physician about intellectual distress she cancelled classes for a week thus the pending litigation
6115689 such conduct is hardly representative of the professoriate at dartmouth my alma mater faculty members tend to be professional they also tend to be sane
6115690 that said even at or especially at putatively superior schools students are spoiled for choice when it comes to professors who share ideologies like ms
6115691 why not its effortless and there are better ways to spend time than thinking deeply about ecofeminism

6115704 voters enthusiastically support chris gregoires common sense effective leadership and are eager for her to serve another term even after a well organized heavily funded attack effort against her governor gregoire triumphed in washingtons primary because she knows how to get results
6115705 the primary results confirm that voters understand full well the difference between governor gregoire and her republican opponent republican dino rossi cut health care for kids slashed education funding and voted against vital transportation funding for transit bridges and ferries the choice in november is clear an accomplished leader who delivers results for all of washington or a george bush republican who sides with special interests over everyday citizens
6115706 governor gregoire is working hard for working families and they will turn out for her in november in even greater numbers

6115751 high quality service and protection against loss are a major competitive advantage for freight forwarders
6115752 right from the start we were looking for an efficient monitoring solution to cover the entire warehouse
6115753 staff are a major factor in the handling of package freight
6115754 shortage of time and the usual warehouse pressures will inevitably mean that some units for shipment are not located
6115755 video monitoring combined with a precise real time location system covering the entire warehouse is therefore absolutely essential
6115756 it used to take us several hours to search through video tapes in order to track the route and locate the position of the shipment in the warehouse thanks to real time location this takes just a few minutes
6115757 this has reduced the number of errors to a minimum and greatly increased the quality of our service a happy side effect has been the way in which the system has considerably improved staff morale whereas searches used to be both time consuming and irritating the rapid query resolution now possible thanks to the process transparency of real time location enable every member of staff to remain quite relaxed we have achieved everything possible in packaged freight regarding process security and distribution quality our logistical processes work and we have realised an roi in much less than 12 months

6115816 we will be enhancing the lcd screen what this actually means is we have taken the already high quality screen and increased the intensity and number of colours it can display
6115817 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6115818 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6115819 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6115820 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well

6115851 the valencia street course is new to formula one so this will present many challenges for the teams for bridgestone we have evaluated the track layout and surface and we will bring the softest tyres in our compound range the soft and super soft this is a street course with many corners although we expect quite high speeds to be attained over the course of a lap as with any street course we expect the grip levels from the circuit to improve over the course of the weekend in valencia in august we should see quite high temperatures so teams will have to be vigilant with their tyre management as we have not raced here previously this should be a learning process for everyone involved and strategy decisions over the race weekend will be interesting

6115853 they say 30 is the new 40 if thats true and im 29 in vancouver then ill really be 19 which is the perfect skating age
6115854 i have a silver and a bronze and you how everyone says theres something missing
6115855 i dont know what that is but i feel like something is missing as well
6115856 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver to ever live
6115857 if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car
6115858 i feel a little lonely in the decisions i have to make on many subjects at many different times
6115859 but carl demonstrated to me and as david ragan does and as matt kenseth did before him and greg biffle did that hes going to be a good in this business as anybody ive ever known
6115860 and hes going to stay there for a long time so i was right in recognizing he had potential and very quickly after he won his first race i told him ill stay in the business as long as you drive these cars i hope that ive got job security for a long time now on account of that
6115861 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any racetrack we go to
6115862 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time and the guys have just repeatedly week after week worked harder and become better
6115863 im guardedly optimistic that well be able to put four cars in the chase
6115864 that wont be the same as when we put five in but carl based on the way that the structure of the chase is will be in better shape than any of the other guys can be
6115865 carl certainly is a strong favorite within my group of prospects of being able to close the deal
6115866 he was very within himself easy enough but at the same time he got something out of the work
6115867 galloped out awfully nice i had to ease him up because he wanted to do a little bit more than that
6115868 calvin said on espn he thought he had me anytime but i beg to differ with that because he was riding way before i was
6115869 i could hear him slapping and chirping way before i was i knew it was a great stretch duel though i think if i get in that same stretch duel this year mambos a fighter hell come back and beat a horse
6115870 he got passed late in the race and still come back and gutted it out and won it
6115871 a couple more feet and he might have won it a little easier hes a stayer hes got a little turn of foot but he stays for a horse thats lightly raced like him i thought it was pretty impressive
6115872 at that point i told will farish i thought that maybe if things kept going in the right direction we might be going somewhere
6115873 i like the steps hes taken his last three starts
6115874 hes made dramatic leaps to where we expected he would hopefully get to
6115875 but as hard as it is to get those quality horses when they run like that youre happy sure winning the travers who doesnt dream about winning it

6116091 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6116092 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
6116093 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
6116094 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
6116095 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
6116096 not in terms of eliminating the parties and receptions that surround the conventions but in terms of curbing the real influence buying events that involved lobbyists and lobbying organizations spending six figure amounts for parties that really were parties thrown by the members themselves

6116152 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
6116153 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector

6116215 we are confident that ivins was the only person responsible for the attacks
6116216 the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown in 1997
6116217 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of the attacks and sought to frame unnamed co workers
6116218 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
6116219 you can trace the anthrax to a lab but you cannot trace it to a person
6116220 totally responsive to every single question and never refused to answer
6116221 so concentrated and so consistent and so clean that i would assert that bruce could not have done that part
6116222 make something that no one else in the world can make with the kind of equipment that is available
6116223 we do not have that capability here nor do we have the scientists who know how to do that
6116224 ivins could not have produced anthrax of that type and potency at his army research lab without many other people being aware of it
6116225 we believe that the white house knew or had reason to know that an anthrax attack was imminent or underway
6116226 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a us government lab sent by a top us army scientist at fort detrick
6116227 from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
6116228 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq
6116229 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade
6116230 was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section

6116248 the reality is you dont need to know everything about it like the hardware you just need to know the throughput and latency
6116249 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6116250 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6116251 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6116252 the real future solution will involve a treatment that specifically addresses each of these
6116253 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6116254 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6116255 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6116256 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6116257 by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6116258 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans
6116259 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6116260 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6116261 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6116262 im not saying people cant take tablets to get enough calcium but eating real food is a great pleasure with salt sweet and fat the problem is to reduce intake without reducing palatability for calcium its a problem of being not palatable enough
6116263 we got comments that we are not the beam team that we are not that strong on beam
6116264 so we really wanted to work on that we are the beam team now and we want to show the world we can claim that title
6116265 to finish off on the very last routine of my olympic experience with a gold medal around my neck is the perfect ending to the story
6116266 to finally be here at the end all the emotions are coming to us and we dont know how to handle them this road has been so hard and i have overcome so much it feels great to be here
6116267 i go by the fact that everything happens for a reason
6116268 i was meant to have the silver in the all around at first it upset me a little but i thought about it and just to have a medal around my neck meant the world to me
6116269 right after i got the x ray i got the diagnosis and had a little breakdown
6116270 and the reason was that i didnt want to be asked off the team we talked to our doctor and got the opinions of others and i didnt think i would make it worse by competing because the bone was still in alignment
6116271 but i was confident that i could do it and that it wouldnt get injured more
6116272 my adrenalin was pumping and i wasnt actually thinking about the pain
6116273 they gave me some medicine and surprisingly it didnt hurt it was more emotional for me because it was my dream to compete in the olympics no one ever goes through making it on the team and thinking this is my future thats what was upsetting to me
6116274 it shows if you systematically work very consistently during the whole quadrennium the results will come
6116275 at this high level it doesnt matter which country or which culture you are in
6116276 you have to train real hard to push the limit

6116288 we will present between september and october options for a grand deal for the disputed areas including kirkuk which is the hottest issue in iraq these days

6116290 process of political give and take which applied to the easiest place
6116291 should in a way apply to the most difficult place which is kirkuk
6116292 overall i was trying to run that line between being true to the silver age and also true to modern readers
6116293 so while readers are enjoying stories with the crick hits a kidnapped rock n roll band from liverpool and millie the model helping manoo and the sentry learn about what a modern woman really wants and the guardians of the galaxy teaming with the sentry to play midwife to a planet theyll also be seeing a glimpse into the true character of the sentry and of the series

6116295 i love writing the smart guys in comics because theyre always pulling something neat out of their brains and as far as teaming the mad thinker and the just a natural it seems to me that the brainy guys would always be hanging out together big brains is their social clique
6116296 they sit in coffee shops and talk about the latest on string theory which they all think is hogwash and they cant resist reconfiguring the cappuccino machine to run around on insect legs and then they all dive into taxis and head to each others laboratories to marvel over the latest robots and then only after all that they start to wonder how to go about taking down the sentry
6116297 as with many projects that call for it i project back to childhood
6116298 readers are going to feel like their caffeine and sugar levels just got cranked up several notches
6116299 it starts out kind of rough but shes a smart girl
6116300 jobs do get in the way of your social life dont they
6116301 i dont know many kids who dont have to work especially now that theyre generating these massive phone bills used to be kids needed gas money now nobody drives if they can help it but everybody has a phone bill
6116302 she has a mature side but hey shes 16 years old
6116303 lots to come lots to deal with you know i think of this series as stories about how mary jane became the woman we know today
6116304 well if there was a tv commercial airing for the upcoming episodes of mj youd see gwen telling a joke through a bullhorn to the girls aerobic class harry racing through the school parking lot in a bmw and spider man doing whatever a spider can
6116305 if michelle is that strong a woman to help obama chose a vp then i definately want them in the white house behind every good man is a strong woman
6116306 i gotta see what kind of stuff we got what kind of baked goods we got
6116307 can i try any since you already got it all sliced up
6116308 i think i could use what about eight eight of them
6116309 thats what people are looking for im telling you you guys are going to have to make a transition gas is going down but its not going to go down back to where it was two or three years ago so people are going to have to change their habits i think what were going to do is help the automakers make more fuel efficient cars that way you can sell more and they are made right here in america
6116310 i think i wouldnt be here if i couldnt win it
6116311 john how long did it take you to think of that question
6116312 these are the setting i used but as always feel free to play around with them
6116313 the only setting i changed from the last time is i have checked
6116314 keep the settings the same as before so no screen shot just deselect invert for the solid white
6116315 keep the settings the same as before but check invert
6116316 grab a fuzzy brush and paint in some wrinkles on the front back and some on the arms as well i smudged out the ends so they tapered off a bit and i applied a gaussian blur of 10 0
6116317 these are my settings but feel free to change them to your own if you wish
6116318 you guessed it now were making the ribbed part so grab your paintbrush again and paint in some lines across the band
6116319 they have a different approach to wine beer and spirits than other generations
6116320 in this generation there is an acceptability of wine as the alcohol of choice and they drink for drinkings sake for pleasure and conviviality less in concert with foods and eating
6116321 they are drinking wine completely different than the previous generation
6116322 they are fearless they are the imac generation they click and try something new if they dont like that they click and try something else
6116323 they just want to try something taste it and if its good post it to a friend they learn from their tribe not the so called wine critics
6116324 we have found that 21 percent of people who drink wine regularly are in that age group
6116325 beverages like coffee have become a vehicle where you can travel the world jamaica colombia brazil its an adventure
6116326 wine is something that has a living soul its about history land geography people its cross cultural when its in the bottle wine changes every day and when you pour it in the glass it will have a personality its so complex wine is always presenting you with a challenge
6116327 objective i am not very picky about the job id like
6116328 promoted to senior administrative assistant and reduced executive travel costs by 15 percent within six months
6116329 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6116330 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6116331 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6116332 obama could not seal the deal with voters during the primaries
6116333 the more voters got to know him the more voters chose hillary clinton
6116334 democrats must offer voters the candidate with the best chance of winning in november the experienced candidate who understands the problems we face and the solutions we need senator hillary rodham clinton
6116335 where obama once got a free pass on such despicable relationships with anti american people such as rev jeremiah wright george soros louis farrakhan the american voters are beginning to realize what a questionable and shady past this man has led
6116336 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned
6116337 we have a historic moment that we need to grasp and we need to move forward as a unified party
6116338 all it will do is give the republican party a greater opportunity to fight our candidate
6116339 if she doesnt stand up and speak against it then shes for it if shes aware of it she needs to make a clear statement that this should not be done
6116340 with that cadre of mal discontents who want to have a war on the democratic floor
6116341 what is my role at the convention then if not to vote for hillary
6116342 if this is just about obama then only invite the obama delegates
6116343 saw great defense saw some great adjustments at the plate saw the international tiebreaker a little bit of everything the sport has to offer
6116344 and it was just a tremendous effort on monicas part i thought she threw exceptionally well and gave us an opportunity to win the ballgame
6116345 any time you have tasha on second it does a lot for you
6116346 any ball i put in play shes either going to advance or hopefully score
6116347 throughout the game i was trying to make adjustments to her pitch and trying to hit what she was throwing instead of waiting for my pitch
6116348 she was coming at me hard and she was going to try to beat me with my speed and knowing with my last at bat that she had jammed me up and in i was thinking for sure she was coming inside and so just waiting for that pitch i knew she was going to bring it hard and just trying to stay early enough to get my bat on it
6116349 but we have some great batters and we just need to give it some time i tried to stay in the moment and come through with some big strikeouts i knew it was going to be a fight
6116350 all throughout the u s exhibition tour coach candrea was always stressing being prepared for the 20 inning game the 16 inning game the 14 inning game
6116351 so all throughout the tour i was able to prepare mentally and physically and emotionally for those games that were going to be longer than seven innings
6116352 thats what you prepare for the 14 inning game and then when you only throw five innings its a bonus
6116353 i think it definitely shows how good every country is
6116354 its something we see away from the olympics japan has beaten us every year we have always played close games with them
6116355 if people away from the olympics could see how this game has grown i think a game like this shows that
6116356 look at the players we can bring off the bench im mean its crazy tamika catching seimone augustus fowles and candace parker youre kidding me so we feel like we can bring our second wave of players and third wave of players
6116357 a lot of times when the reserves come in that is when the game breaks open
6116358 its not always because the first five isnt doing a great job its because thats when the fatigue sets in for the other team
6116359 she comes in there with three or four people around her and just reaches up grabs the ball and puts it in
6116360 we talked about the depth of this team from the beginning
6116361 its like our starting five is in the playing with energy and then when subs come in it never goes away in fact it picks up
6116362 they did a very good job of picking the 12 players that they did
6116363 when you can call anybody off the bench and they come bring it in for you i think its great its up to us to utilize our depth well
6116364 we dont have to have anybody worn out by playing 25 or 30 minutes the coaches get every ounce from everybody and we are not going to overuse anybody
6116365 this team has the best chemistry of any of the teams i ever been on especially after coming together for such a short period of time
6116366 the scary thing about them is that they have players with tremendous ability their front line is something to contend with
6116367 carpet is a safe cost effective and fashionable choice for many indoor settings
6116368 and they said gosh were we ever any good in this sport and that just about killed me
6116369 as close to a dysfunctional family as you could find
6116370 i think they felt like they were outcasts in a way
6116371 they felt almost like usa water polo turned their back on them and thats not the case at all i feel like we had to just show that people were just there supporting them people were there that cared about it i was one of them i was going to fight for them whatever it took
6116372 a lot of great pieces a lot of great players but they were individuals and they had to start believing in each other and trusting each other
6116373 especially with him being a great captain and me being able to talk to him and learn a couple things from him
6116374 but i think the biggest thing was the players all of us being in the same situation for the last 10 years and sacrificing everything and finally coming together and saying guys weve got to do it together all of us or none all for one
6116375 since the last major tournament the world championships in 2007 where the u s finished ninth the team is not even close to what it was then every game we seem to be growing
6116376 were playing as a team now in the past i think weve maybe been relying on a couple of people and now everybodys contributing everybodys believing
6116377 in serbia even though they kicked the crap out of us early on as nine days in serbia wore on we got a little closer and a little closer
6116378 beating them and controlling them the entire game showed us hey guys we can beat anybody in the world
6116379 dont go into any game with fear and thats what we did monday
6116380 the idea for this restaurant which is somewhat a misnomer in the ordinance the way it describes restaurants is a takeout sandwich facility
6116381 you go in make your purchase of your sandwich and leave get in your car that would be parked in mr russos existing parking lot
6116382 city inspectors didnt hear about the three rooms inside the restaurant with seating for 48 people russo was served with a citation of the zoning infraction which carries a penalty of a 1 000 fine and up to 30 days in jail
6116383 it the agreement with the city didnt say take out only
6116384 a chatham county recorders court judge delayed a hearing on a zoning violation at russos seafood restaurant in the thomas square neighborhood
6116385 the city has cited owner charlie russo jr for going back on a promise he made to open a takeout only restaurant in the 200 block of east 40th street
6116386 what on earth does virginia mobley have against people sitting down to eat
6116387 this has become more of a witch hunt than a zoning issue
6116388 mahoney laid the blame at the feet of the citys restaurant ordinance which he said has no definition of take out and only has two restaurant categories with or without alcohol
6116389 nobody can tell us what a take out certificate is
6116390 several commission members however seemed to doubt that russo did not understand the phrase
6116391 i dont see any unintentional or accidental misuse here russo advertised contrary to what he was doing
6116392 i felt all along that business wise this was the best opportunity and fortunately for me its worked out really well
6116393 i felt though my wifes from there i had spent 10 years there sometimes thats enough and i loved it i loved the people
6116394 but its almost like youre always that kid it was just time for something different is what my feeling was and you know what my wife was supportive she felt the same way its time for something new

6116398 it is the right in british politics which is now making the running
6116399 given the recent events in georgia we do not believe that the current arrangement in the european democrat group in the council of europe parliamentary assembly can continue as it is
6116400 we are already in the process of consulting our partners within the group such as the polish law and justice party and the czech civic democrats about the way forward
6116401 we note that the socialist group in the council of europe of which the labour party is a member also includes vladimir zhirinovskys ultra nationalist russian liberal democrat party who has said that the georgian prime minister is seeking a mono ethnic state and a fascist style dictatorship and claimed that following the us polish missile agreement russia was now entitled to carry out a preventive nuclear strike against poland
6116402 it is the right in british politics which is now making the running
6116403 i think it is clear its within our international legal obligations
6116404 the tariff was accepted by consensus and i want to emphasize by consensus by members of the wto including brazil at the conclusion of the uruguay round of wto negotiations going back at least 15 years
6116405 not only is the u s ethanol tariff in its current form explicitly permitted under wto rules there are also many policy reasons for opposing the lower tariff
6116406 the united states remains heavily reliant upon foreign energy sources and lowering the ethanol tariff would only make us more dependent upon imported energy and what difference does that make if thats oil or ethanol were still sending money overseas that we ought to be keeping in the united states

6116413 its a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet hush money is what i call it
6116414 i wouldnt sell my front yard for a million dollars
6116415 i understand we need to pump our own oil our own gas
6116416 but we dont need to destroy our homes all of our trees and blow ourselves up whos going to be here to enjoy the gas then
6116417 gas drilling has no business in an urban area so i dont want to contribute to a company thats doing that to my community
6116418 were the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood right in the heart of the city
6116419 from what i see the markets are telling us to prepare for hard times and a global spate of the worst deflation to be seen in generations this is why gold has been sinking this is why stocks have been falling big money sophisticated money is cashing out raising cash preparing for world deflation
6116420 this is probably why lowrys selling pressure stays at its high
6116421 smart money is selling into the stock market day after day theyre raising cash in preparation for the hard times when deflation is in the saddle deflation is ushering in the new strong dollar big money sees deflation and the lower rates that go with deflation look if you have five million dollars and you are only receiving 2 in interest on your money thats only an income of hundred thousand dollars on your five million big money realizes that in a deflation you need a mountain of cash to keep up your lifestyle
6116422 what i see is a coming world deflation and i believe thats the message the markets are sending whats the best stance in a deflationary situation lots of cash and safe solid investments two areas that fit that requirement us dollars and us treasury paper what happens to stocks during deflationary times theyre sold to raise cash what happens to business in deflationary times its crushed by ever lower prices what happens to the average citizen whos loaded with debt during deflationary times theyre battered unmercifully as income buys less and less and as debt crushes them what happens to assets during deflationary times theyre worth less and less and their sale brings in fewer and fewer dollars isnt the price of gold and oil already telling us that

6116424 should oil prices declines of which have been as stunning as the dollars gains stabilize or even rebound that likely would be another reason behind a reversal of some of the dollars moves against the euro
6116425 i suspect we will see a correction as weve had such a massive move already
6116426 we need fresh perspectives on how to combine public policy with the governments clout as an employment innovator if done right the public sector can assume a leading role in job generation even if these are work assignments that are time bound and objectives driven

6116461 i was sad to see the story end with the last book so i decided to write a sequel for myself and my wife and kids
6116462 i read the book to my wife who is my toughest critic
6116463 she said it was worth sharing but i certainly didnt expect what happened
6116464 people were speculating that it was a test market tool for a new book series or a movie or a video game
6116465 i knew some mystery would be to my advantage but i began to get a little worried when the response got so huge
6116466 i told her id have taken down the site if shed asked me to its her world and i respect her desire to control it
6116467 still it was really cool to know the creator of the harry potter world reviewed my story
6116468 while i was writing elders crossing i knew it was meant to be a part of a series
6116469 i just didnt know if id write it now though loads of people do seem to want to hear the rest of the story what more could a writer ask for
6116470 i get a lot of emails but the two big questions i see most are will these ever be published as books and will there be a movie
6116471 i shouldnt talk much about it but i am quite curious to see how it turns out
6116472 they consulted me by email about the screenplay and casting
6116473 but thats about it its their creation entirely and i cant wait to see how the story looks through their eyes
6116474 people ask my permission if they can write their own stories based on my james potter adventures it feels extremely weird but i always tell them to go for it and have fun its all about the story
6116475 sure id love to see my books printed since a lot of people wont read novels off of their computers but i wont make a big legal mess like vander ark writer of the disputed harry potter lexicon id love to get ms rowlings permission to publish if she thought my stories were worth it ive told her that id split the proceeds with her for charity but i wont fight her over it i just want to keep the story going
6116476 it already exists i just havent written it yet lets just wait and see what people think of book two
6116477 was skeptical and a little horrified that such recent books of the moment as dan browns the da vinci code and angels and demons made the harris poll
6116478 orwells 1984 is the clear favorite among disinformation readers with over 1 in 10 of survey respondents including it in their top ten and twice as popular as their next favorite douglas adamss the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
6116479 but from there on in it was a horserace for the remaining spots in the overall top ten
6116480 to try to get people into a state of generalized agnosticism not agnosticism about god alone but agnosticism about everything
6116481 one can surely question whether the bible is really non fiction as many disinformation readers already do considering that the god delusion and god is not great are in our non fiction top ten with a famous provocateur of christianity mr god is dead himself friedrich nietzsche within the top five reaffirms my belief that this is a shared sentiment among disinformation readers
6116482 with the tao te ching at the top for our non fiction list and placing in the overall top ten
6116483 disinformation is a much more a skeptical audience and arguably more well read than those surveyed in the harris poll
6116484 our goal as a publisher has always been to find those people that want to question the convention wisdom and lately theres been no shortage of things to have serious questions about

6116511 the harlem book fair has always been considered a very special african american literary event
6116512 with the launching of our publishing imprint this year our tenth will be even more memorable
6116513 aids is the wrath of a just god against homosexualism
6116514 im going to spare lil romeo who will be18 in august however lil in stature but this year according to a past arrest he will be
6116515 and seemed to be the heir apparent to seminal black designer
6116516 most bookstores buy stock for 20 to 40 percent off suggested retail
6116517 but they can buy remainders and other bargain books for as much as 90 percent off retail price that means they can sell the books for less in a time when consumers are spending fewer dollars on books and still make a higher profit margin
6116518 its a great opportunity for bookstores and other retailers to stock up for the winter holiday season which accounts for a disproportionate part of annual book sales
6116519 they said if you was white youd be alright if you was brown stick around but as you is black oh brother get back get back get back
6116520 if it wasnt for race mixing thered be no video girls me and most of our friends like mutts a lot yeah in the hood they call em mutts
6116521 i just gotta tell you i usually dont get into darker skinned men but you are attractive for a dark skinned man i just wanted to tell you that
6116522 excuse me i know that you meant that as a compliment and i appreciate the spirit in which it was given but please dont say that to another darker skinned person again
6116523 i said thank you but i dont think you should repeat that to anybody else
6116524 no i mean im flattered by what you meant but what you said isnt complimentary at all
6116525 i mean if i said to you i dont usually like black girls but you are cute for a black girl how would you take that it is almost like saying that black women on average arent attractive but youre the exception
6116526 the relationships we have with others in the industry are more important to us than getting a bigger piece of the pie
6116527 because we are connected to a world wide ministry we are able to do things differently than other publishers we are here to advance the kingdom of god when we concentrate on building kingdom based relationships with like minded ministries we can trust god for the revenue
6116528 we have realized that we dont have to do it all be it all or create it all nor should we try
6116529 no one can be the best at everything when we take the focus off of trying to match what the other publishers are doing we are free do what we do best and be who we are a mission based servant publisher
6116530 in any company there are three basic options when it comes to meeting customer needs
6116531 you can make it buy it or partner for it our partners are those ministries and organizations that can bring to our customers expertise in areas we cannot and vice versa
6116532 navpress is no more or less important than any other publisher or ministry
6116533 but we each have a distinct role the focus needs to shift from trying to find ways to out do each other to discovering how we can best serve each other the relationships we have with others in the industry are more important to us than getting a bigger piece of the pie
6116534 you have to be thin to be a model i dont have to live up to that model standard anymore
6116535 after more than 30 years of war in afghanistan i think this medal is a very great message for peace and the future of afghanistan
6116536 it is a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before
6116537 i missed out on sydney 2000 because i was very young and in athens 2004 because of injury now im 28 years old and more mature
6116538 weve fought many matches against each other in pan american events and weve known each other for a long time we know each other strengths and weaknesses i thought i went the extra mile and put in the extra effort and when the judge approached us it crossed my mind that he would be inclined to raise the hand in my favor and it would be a great joy for my country
6116539 i was a hillary clinton supporter and she took new hampshire and massachusetts where i worked for her
6116540 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6116541 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
6116542 i was really surprised at the free accounting features nolapro packs in along with an easy to use secure interface businesses that want to add expanded reporting or other features or who want to customize nolapro for their business can do so with low cost modules services and options nolapro can be integrated with third party or in house software
6116543 jennies point was that gender should have nothing to do with voting if you have a system where a vote represents a family
6116544 keep in mind that people do have personal convictions people used to vote as a family and also people who owned land used to vote because their vote affected their land i wonder if cynthia gee knew this and if so then she is ashamed of her founding fathers because thats how they voted
6116545 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6116546 what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
6116547 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6116548 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
6116549 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
6116550 they had sequential numbers but they were not in any way linked to call them a package is a tactic to try to reach out and grab issues in an attempt to divert attention from this one
6116551 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6116552 what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
6116553 the words person human being child and individual shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
6116554 occurs as a result of natural or induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion
6116555 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6116556 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
6116557 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
6116558 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6116559 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6116560 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
6116561 but when you take a definition comparable to the federal one and combine it with other provisions that attempt to give full personhood to a fetus that is pre viable and try to put fear of criminal and civil liability in the minds of physicians you have created a much different scenario
6116562 because they interfered negatively with the physician patient relationship attempted to dictate the practice of medicine for neonatal care and greatly expanded civil liability for physicians
6116563 they had sequential numbers but they were not in any way linked to call them a package is a tactic to try to reach out and grab issues in an attempt to divert attention from this one
6116564 in the current world almost no market or public good is really global in the sense of covering the full area of the earths globe the transnational circulation of persons goods services and capital has increased substantially since the mid twentieth century but although the total amount of transnational trade is increasing each imperial area captures a rather stable share of total world trade the only economies whose shares of world trade have clearly increased at higher rates than their shares of world production are those of the european union up to generating more than 40 percent of world trade there is a clear trend toward imperial sized blocs especially north america europe and east asia trade is indeed becoming more concentrated over time within a few large empires of the world it is not likely that they will completely merge and lead the world economy to global free trade anytime soon
6116565 it would be better to thrust yourself upon this sword than enter the circle with fear in your heart
6116566 i purify this circle by earth only love may enter only love may leave
6116567 i purify this circle by air only love may enter only love may leave
6116568 i purify this circle by fire only love may enter only love may leave
6116569 i purify this circle by water only love may enter only love may leave
6116570 its a slow technology to evolve with just 5 to 10 percent improvement per year
6116571 manufacturers have tried to make better ones but barring the development of a tiny nuclear power generator for mobile devices there isnt much they can do
6116572 theres the periodic table and just so many elements and weve done about as much as can do with that aspect
6116573 about a girl named simone young she runs to the world of fame because she has this insatiable desire to be famous and at the same time to be loved she winds up in porn pretty much fulfilling peoples desires and through porn she goes through these trials and tribulations of trying to find love in all the wrong places at the same time she becomes an amazing big top adult star and breaks into the mainstream entertainment business
6116574 es la primera vez que pedimos ayuda para poder hacer frente a esta operaci n pero nos vemos obligadas a ello
6116575 its just one of those nagging injuries thats probably not going to go away completely while im playing ill have to deal with it
6116576 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
6116577 saya berharap mendapatkan hasil yang bagus di enam balapan tersisa musim 2008 ini dan setelah itu saya pindah ke tim lain
6116578 saya akan mengendarai kawasaki tahun depan jadi ini merupakan kesempatan besar bagiku
6116579 john hopkins pembalap yang sangat bagus dan mungkin dia perlu rekan satu tim yang lebih kuat agar sedikit lebih termotivasi mungkin saya juga perlu seorang teman agar lebih termotivasi sebab saya ingin bekerja secara dekat dekan rekan satu tim ini akan menjadi pengalaman yang baik dan saya cukup yakin
6116580 barangkali itu pilihan yang baik untuk kembali ke fausto gresini saya mempunyai saat yang menyenangkan dengannya dan dia telah membantuku banyak
6116581 i dont like to call it a disaster because there has been no loss of human life i am amazed at the publicity for the loss of a few birds
6116582 never in my long lifetime have i ever seen such an aroused populace at the grassroots level this oil pollution has done something i have never seen before in santa barbara it has united citizens of all political persuasions in a truly nonpartisan cause
6116583 it is sad that it was necessary that santa barbara should be the example that had to bring it to the attention of the american people the santa barbara incident has frankly touched the conscience of the american people
6116584 i had been impressed by the way energetic college students shopkeepers surfers parents with their kids all joined the beach clean up i saw a montecito society matron transporting oily birds in her mercedes
6116585 the federal government had largely ignored the need to protect commercial recreational aesthetic and ecological values of the area
6116586 we should feel a great sense of urgency about the impending peak oil scenario because it is with climate change the most dangerous crisis we have ever faced by far
6116587 the answer to these crises is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
6116588 luckily al gore will be making principled venture capital investments on our behalf
6116589 this if you like is what i would describe as the
6116590 desperate group of people trying to make something out of nothing
6116591 la tenis de masa este mult mai usor sa obtii o medalie la olimpiada decat la campionatele mondiale aici sunt limitate locurile de participare mai ales pentru jucatorii asiatici care sunt foarte buni nu vor putea concura decat trei dintre acestia astfel ca sansele mele la podium cresc
6116592 tata m a luat cu el la campionatele internationale de juniori ale romaniei desi aveam numai 6 ani urmaream cu maxim interes intrecerea asta l a determinat pe tata sa ma ia de mana si sa ma duca la sala
6116593 i would like to reiterate that we continue to look at the best way to grow the aussie business
6116594 there are many options available to us in todays market as we are in a far stronger position than most of our competitors and we want to take advantage of this
6116595 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
6116596 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
6116597 the identification of a stem cell line with o negative blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
6116598 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
6116599 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
6116600 i want to remind everybody that when i exposed charles zentai his initial reaction was that he wanted to come to hungary to clear his name
6116601 i think its high time he had his day in court
6116602 i realise on a certain level that his children are victims here but it is time to stop thinking of the lovely grandfather from perth and start thinking of peter balazs the young teenager who was brutally murdered
6116603 a person of his age who is innocent for it to have come to this is very wrong
6116604 my father is very much an innocent man and efraim zuroff should look at the peoples courts in hungary the conduct of the peoples courts the torture that was involved in obtaining statements from people and why no jewish forced labourers made statements against my father in relation to the murder of peter balazs
6116605 all those statements theyre using against my father were made by hungarian soldiers and they were in fear of their own lives they knew my father was safe in germany and so they dumped all that allegation on him and its a classic defence strategy
6116606 we can stand aside and say that is the way things are or we can try and do something about it
6116607 australia has already indicated through the port moresby declaration that we are prepared to be long term partners with the countries of the region on their path to development but at thesame time we need to see measurable progress
6116608 the ultimate aim of any taxation measure in relation to transport needs to be to reduce emissions
6116609 the greens will move to have the luxury car tax transformed into a tax based on vehicle greenhouse emissions and we are keen to discuss how best to achieve this with the government opposition and independents
6116610 before the discussions are finalised it is too soon to say how the greens may finally vote
6116611 if thats their attitude i guess it just shows they dont care about people in the country
6116612 subsidies to fossil fuels will have to be phased out as part of the climate effort
6116613 the environmental cost of fossil fuels needs to be reflected in their price
6116614 having a strong budget surplus is an important buffer against international economic uncertainty
6116615 it was probably something i went into as a result of people i met in vegas lets put it that way
6116616 i bought the quarry as an investment and its done nothing at all and all of a sudden out of the blue ive had an offer to start it up and get it going as a business so im going over to run that
6116617 one of the most elegant and impressive homes on the whitsunday mainland
6116618 i love it to bits its a shame to be leaving it really but weve got to do what weve got to do
6116619 it would be nice to think i could but i am pretty much asking what it cost me and what i put into the place
6116620 for 10 years we used to base ourselves in england for the polo and we flew all around france and germany and wherever
6116621 this sort of behaviour it is putting entire regions along the murray darling basin on their knees
6116622 but at the moment for the people who are up the top of the basin it is first in best dressed showing no concern for anyone down lower it is un australian
6116623 we are going to be running out of water in the next few weeks there will be water for critical human needs and that is it everyone is starting to get very anxious
6116624 we know river systems dont respect state borders surely in the middle of one of the worst droughts in our history we can get our institutional structure in place to recognise that reality
6116625 the desperate need to accelerate the purchase of environmental water so we can secure the health of those river systems
6116626 we have also committed to working with state governments to co fund the purchase of appropriately located irrigation properties and their water entitlements to enhance environmental outcomes in the northern basin
6116627 public storage facilities had enjoyed inflow and rivers have run at their best for several years providing extended opportunity to harvest water
6116628 which demonstrates the highly variable way that streams can run in queensland
6116629 breaks out into floodplains or alternatively feeds into terminal wetlands resulting in a great loss of this water
6116630 this means that the scope for substantial volume to flow through to the murray is very limited
6116631 we need to implement an interim basin plan within months so that we can start managing this system given the circumstances we currently find ourselves in
6116632 the river systems and the agricultural systems are collapsing and our institutional response needs to match that reality that nature has imposed on us
6116633 we are not really pointing the finger at the irrigators up there you do what you are allowed to do
6116634 water is a shared responsibility if the states cant handle it and cant agree it has got to move to federal control
6116635 we probably did take a fair bit of water in queensland this year simply because the river ran for a long period of time
6116636 towns almost died up here everybody just stopped spending money
6116637 most farms let most of their staff go seven dry years it was past anything anyone could ever believe
6116638 a lot of sorghum and sunflowers and soybeans there is a bit of wheat in now
6116639 it has got some cash flow going and it has got the towns going again
6116640 how stupid does australia look when we are flying people in from overseas to do these jobs
6116641 how can we have an entire industry out there under threat because we cant get people to work here
6116642 theres not enough encouragement in the system to get people off the dole and into these jobs
6116643 there has to be tougher rules because indigenous people just arent taking up the jobs if youre not prepared to put your hand up for a job no matter where it is we shouldnt have to continue paying the dole the vast majority of indigenous people need to work and are ready to work
6116644 it would be a tragedy if it had to be farmed out to other nations
6116645 i think it is because at a time when entry level work is shrinking these are areas where our people can show they can enter
6116646 the most difficult end of the labour market young indigenous people with no skills
6116647 the bottom line from our end is you cannot force people to work
6116648 all the attempts we have made in getting indigenous workers involved have failed the best form of aid for anyone is employment and opportunity
6116649 if we can give people work its a win win situation but they just wont take the work
6116650 how can we have 22 000 low skill jobs go begging when we have so many indigenous people who are unemployed
6116651 unemployment benefits should be suspended in places like mildura during the picking season if jobs cant be filled
6116652 its not entirely realistic to force people to move vast distances
6116653 but if unskilled work is readily available in a particular area unemployment benefits should no longer be available
6116654 dont we have our first priority and responsibility to australians particularly those who havent got work
6116655 no way stop indigenous australians from getting a job as a seasonal worker
6116656 overseas low skilled seasonal workers will be employed only after employers have demonstrated they have first made reasonable efforts to employ australians
6116657 the lnp amounts to a nationals takeover of the liberal party
6116658 weve had numerous meetings right around the state many of them oversubscribed to the point where we cant actually fit people in through the doors
6116659 these were not matters that were germane at the time
6116660 they werent matters that were raised with me they were raised within the context of the submission
6116661 im just a member of parliament who had some responsibilities at the time and there is an inquiry and im happy to wait for the result of the inquiry
6116662 they are a thoroughly professional organisation but sometimes mistakes are made
6116663 whoever can provide security to the afghan people will rule and theyre closer to providing security to the people than we are
6116664 a lot of money follows the military and political agenda rather than being spent on a needs basis
6116665 as a teenager i fought for my country so we could have a healthy functioning stable transparent government
6116666 this country is in tatters its in ruins it needs capable people professionalism and capability i felt like i was banging my head against a concrete wall the trouble you go through to get reform happening is like going to hell
6116667 we have a young democracy we have state institutions an executive a legislative assembly a judiciary politicians are not imprisoned and the electricity works
6116668 afghanistan is incredibly important in the minds of the mujahidin
6116669 its the site of their greatest victory against the soviet union which they saw as a divinely inspired victory a gift from god
6116670 there is significant room for expansion at major department stores including macys dillards bon ton and or belk
6116671 with this new license the companys ck licenses could represent 35 of sales mix by the end of 2009 up from 25 in 2008
6116672 weather forecasts are dry its not as good growing weather now for corn and soybeans
6116673 the weather was supportive plus goldman reiterated their forecast for 149 dollar a barrel crude oil by the end of the year
6116674 grains were bought back on stronger oil prices and a general recovery in commodities grains have experienced severe sell offs and the market is now in a short covering phase
6116675 doesnt look like there is going to be a whole lot of rain probably not enough to ease concerns
6116676 it is of increasing concern for the filling crops particularly in the areas with low soil moisture
6116677 there are concerns from the profarmer tour in the western belt that soy pod counts arent as big as expected and thats giving the market some support
6116678 we need to see some favourable weather in these corn fields to prevent that yield from declining
6116679 it is too bad that it has been as dry as it has because it would have been much better
6116680 i think shes real cool do you mind sending me some tips to being
6116681 alicia keys i would like to thank her for her kind and generous contribution
6116682 miss paraguay kandidate leryn franco doet mee aan de spelen tot groot plezier van de toeschouwers
6116683 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st
6116684 bring it i still help elect the popes around here last time i checked
6116685 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
6116686 after being silent for a while were proud to be in leipzig
6116687 he came here camouflaged as the guy from slipknot we know the wrong kind of music and drugs have bad effects young people need to be informed of the effects of bad satanic music
6116688 whenever there is a murder people jump to conclusions and always god or satan told the killers to do it these notions shouldnt be taken seriously because it is straightforward someone of their own free will can kill another person
6116689 weve had no confirmation that it was in fact a slipknot mask the band is not going to respond
6116690 in japan hidden camera photography itself is not against the law as of 2002 however distributing such photos publicly may break the law
6116691 camera phones sold in japan make an audible noise when taking a picture this feature makes the subject more likely to notice if clandestine upskirt photos are being taken without consent
6116692 the name comes from the fact that the radios volume and power are controlled by the wheels of the car to turn the radio on or to control its volume the car needs to be in motion what s even more appealing is that the car body is made of wood not metal or plastic
6116693 eu fa o uma an lise sofisticada e complexa que avalia a transforma o da m dia atrav s de quatro esferas de tens es quer dizer quatro rela es de incid ncia sobre a m dia e como elas influ ram para a sua transforma o e a est a rela o da m dia com a sociedade civil a m dia como poder pol tico o mercado e o jornalismo propriamente dito

6116695 the best basis around for user centered interaction design both as a primer for students as an introduction to the field and as a resource for research practitioners to fall back on it should be labelled start here
6116696 if you are a mineral owner and receive a letter in the mail with a check included requesting that you sign a document that appears to be a mineral lease you should be extremely cautious because you may be permanently signing away valuable mineral rights without realizing it
6116697 it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat
6116698 and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6116699 i guess its fair to say that were getting close to that position at the moment
6116700 what this woman has done has not just broke my heart she has hurt a lot of people
6116701 im just going to pray that justice will be served
6116702 obviously he was at the wrong place at the wrong time
6116703 when you work at a school youre like a proud parent watching them grow up for four years and youre happy to see them leave
6116704 we are not here because chad died we are here because chad lived
6116705 i will remember chad singing as much as he spoke
6116706 he would come into the office and just belt out a tune you couldnt help but laugh
6116707 my strong lead was achieved without spending money on television radio or mailers now that the primary is behind us i am looking ahead to november and the task of ensuring that all voters are familiar with my strong record of fighting crime and protecting families
6116708 when it comes to energy consumers are much more cost conscious
6116709 control or lack of it is a highly emotional value tied to a core american value the freedom of choice and should be leveraged in messaging
6116710 elsa theyre boring people that is all this is how boring people are they bore you i dont know why you are wasting your time havent you ever met anyone who was boring before
6116711 well that explains it let me save you some time ive met boring people ive met lots of them and this is how they are theyre all the same you must really like what your gigolo can do for you and that much i can understand but youre wasting your time with the rest of these people youre waiting for boring people to do something interesting and its never going happen so now that we have that cleared up are you coming over today if you do i promise not to bore you youve had plenty of that i think youd do well with a change
6116712 elsa elsa this is mary ann i got your number from cruella is lover boy there
6116713 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6116714 real power cant be given it has to be taken
6116715 we are reviving an event that is very special to marquette university cross country
6116716 it gives the coaching staff a chance to evaluate the fitness of our runners for the upcoming season
6116717 der titel war nat rlich eine tolle sache f r uns nun m ssen wir uns bei den profis aber wieder neu beweisen
6116718 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6116719 the president personally called rohullah nikpai and congratulated him for this achievement
6116720 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6116721 more frequently among a growing portion of the adolescent population
6116722 as young as 11 talking about giving and receiving oral sex
6116723 at the back of the bus in classrooms in gyms when no ones around all over the school its happening
6116724 oral sex is very popular among teens as young as 13
6116725 waiting to have sex is a nice idea but nobody really does
6116726 oral sex is sex and is not part of the repertoire of abstinent behavior oral sex is likewise neither safe nor safer sex
6116727 any genital contact at all whether hand to genital mouth to genital or genital to genital is sex
6116728 but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart
6116729 chad was famous thats the only way to describe him
6116730 lately a lot of people from my past have been coming back into my life and the funny and weird part about it is its the same people who i actually cared the most about
6116731 it kills me how god works in the most craziest ways im hoping for the best for these rekindled friendships losing a friendship twice is not even cool im trying to believe that the ones who have came back are the ones that are going to stick around
6116732 dont get me wrong the new friends i have i love n cherish with all of my heart but the people from my past knew who i was then and everyone now knows this new chad very different yet still the same
6116733 i am going to die being a caring person that always apologizes for my wrongdoings
6116734 were only on this earth for a short time in comparison to the eternity well spend with god in heaven our lives here are just an eye blink were born we burn brightly for a short time then our light burns out our passion as christians during our brief journey is to pass on the light to as many people as we can
6116735 binnen een half jaar de contouren voor dit team helder zijn
6116736 its a shock to me and to her agents that this is happening i dont think the family is making the right choice theres definitely more to lose than to gain ive put too much time and effort into michelle to be able to sit by and watch this happening without saying something if she doesnt stick to doing whats sensible we could see one of the greatest potential talents the game has ever known going to waste
6116737 last week patricia ryan told the franklin county board of revision that her house near canal winchester is worth less than the auditors 139 800 value the county should cut the property taxes on the pompano street house she bought new for 112 643 two years ago she said ryan pointed out a neighboring house also built by dominion homes that has been vacant for a year cant sell it cant rent it she said
6116738 the market being as slow as it is thats cash builders are holding onto to get through said james b
6116739 i cant afford to pay any more than i should be paying
6116740 a three bedroom condo near reynoldsburg is still on the market after nearly a year despite dropping its asking price from 133 900 to 119 900 said sandra boden the realtor trying to sell the unit another condo in the area that was purchased for 127 900 in august 2007 just sold for 99 000 she said
6116741 this is the worst ive ever seen it in columbus said boden who has been in the business 29 years
6116742 during the peak of the real estate boom boden would sell 20 to 25 homes a year this year she has sold one and is about to close on her second she said buyers are looking for the right deal she said adding that if they dont get it theyre walking away
6116743 every day free advertising leaflets are dropped off on the driveway of the vacant house next to bob johnsons home the realtor rarely comes by so trash duty has fallen into the hands of the neighbors
6116744 the place has been empty for a year johnson said
6116745 while sales are up the average sales price this year through july was 112 319 a 22 percent drop from the 145 081 average sales price for the same period in 2007 and foreclosures remain a problem there were 496 properties in clinton eaton and ingham counties with foreclosure related filings last month according to realtytrac
6116746 on houses that are not foreclosures people are not getting the price that they want said kathy birchen an associate broker in okemos
6116747 thats creating opportunities for bargain hunters and investors agents say the deal was so good on the house natalie and larry sachs bought last week near owosso that the couple were willing to deal with having two mortgages until their eaton rapids area home sells
6116748 the sachses bought the 3 500 square foot house on 27 acres for 285 000 it was more land than we ever thought wed be able to get and the house was almost 100 percent of what we really wanted in a house natalie sachs said
6116749 its a sign of the times when real estate offices have for sale signs posted out front many real estate agents who left the business say they dont want to talk about it
6116750 flo abke owner broker of realty executives in st clair shores said she knows a talented agent who had to leave for a job at starbucks abke who was with century 21 in eastpointe for 20 years before the office closed in 2006 opened her own office two years ago and has found it to be a challenge
6116751 i go home every night thinking of how i can get my houses sold and make sure everyone in my office is ok she said
6116752 a decade long housing boom in northwest indiana has been reduced to a thud for a while there it was a total zoo said crown point building administrator bill kozlowski who had contractors standing two and three deep in front of his office in 2004 when his department issued a record 479 permits for new homes
6116753 right now builders are telling me the money is available but its hard to qualify for a mortgage anymore he said
6116754 this is no surprise at all given the trends nationally and in the chicago marketplace said carol rogers of the indiana business research institute noting census data showed a 20 percent drop in permit requests nationally and a 50 percent decline in the chicago area
6116755 just how goofy is the chicago condo market some would say it has been goofy for years but now that credit is constricted and speculators have left the market consider this statistic from the appraisal research counselors ltd report on downtown condos
6116756 it said that in the second quarter 466 condo sales contracts were signed downtown but 358 were attributed to the 150 story chicago spire the spire developers reported their initial sales in the 1 200 unit building in one swoop so they skewed the results without the spire the downtown market had only 108 sales in the second quarter an extremely low figure
6116757 appraisal research said buyers are on the sidelines and developers are resorting to incentives many of which are not advertised and are offered only when the sales center has a live prospect appraisal research found that the market still has an unsold inventory of about 7 300 units
6116758 through mid august 26 homes have been sold in forest park in 2008 according to listings information provided by gary mancuso president of the oak park area association of realtors in 2007 59 single family homes changed hands
6116759 forest park however remains saturated with available properties sixty nine single family homes in this small community are being actively marketed in neighboring oak park and river forest home values have declined much more sharply in the last year than in forest park the average single family home in oak park is selling for 41 000 less in river forest properties are fetching 91 000 less a drop of about 10 5 percent
6116760 as for the overall stability in the local real estate market local realtor jerry jacknow said buyers fears are only being spurred by media reports to be honest it seems the media is scaring people because they print a lot more negative than they do positive jacknow said
6116761 tari jacobs who is president of the realtors association of southwestern illinois and leads agents in st clair monroe randolph and clinton counties said she has seen more foreclosures filed at her agency concept real estate in columbia
6116762 i can only speak for my office but foreclosures are up jacobs said
6116763 between june 12 and july 25 barron said she paid up on her mortgage and car payments but two weeks ago she learned that legal fees for her potential foreclosure had accrued she owes 1 600
6116764 when kathy felton bought a duplex 20 years ago she dreamed it would be a home for life for her and her son but 20 years later the bank foreclosed on that dream and last week a horse trailer three sheriffs cars and a flatbed truck came to carry away her belongings
6116765 doug tschauder an attorney for legal aid of western missouri who specializes in foreclosures said hes seen a definite increase in people needing help with mortgage problems unfortunately i dont have any hard numbers but theres definitely been an increase here in this office and from everything i can tell the number of foreclosures in the area is picking up he said
6116766 marilyn rajca of re max of st joseph is a real estate agent dealing in foreclosures she said the number of local foreclosures has increased
6116767 foreclosures over the last three years have been pretty steady here but ive seen it pick up in the last month or so she said
6116768 sheriffs sales counties use them as a key indicator of the mortgage crisis have ballooned more than sixfold since 2003 in 10 metro counties an analysis by the federal reserve bank of minneapolis this spring predicted that several suburban cities were bound for a flood of foreclosures because tens of thousands of subprime borrowers will face higher payments on their adjustable rate mortgages
6116769 cities as geographically diverse as ham lake apple valley shakopee oakdale forest lake elk river albertville and plymouth will experience problems the analysis said because of concentrations of these types of mortgages
6116770 also projected as a trouble spot is woodbury where concern over an 82 percent increase in foreclosures since last year led city leaders to create a task force to ease the pain we saw the writing on the wall and it didnt look pretty said city analyst matt stemwedel
6116771 hennepin county for example has seen a record numbers of sheriffs sales with 3 826 in the first six months of 2008 ramsey countys sales soared nearly 800 percent from 393 in all of 2003 to 1 648 through june of this year washington county now is averaging about 100 foreclosures a month up from a total of 147 in 2003
6116772 its ultimately a correction to a market that went crazy too long said rick ketterling who sells houses for coldwell banker burnet in the south metro
6116773 whats going on is that a lot of these people are upside down where what they owe on their mortgages is more than the value of their homes said mark ulfers of the dakota county community development agency
6116774 for example a condo in burnsville that sold for 405 000 in march 2007 went through foreclosure and now is selling for 182 900 even though the countys market value is 366 900 said dan rogness an agency analyst and a single family house in west st paul purchased in november 2005 for 155 000 now is on the market for 100 000 less
6116775 without the spire the downtown market had only 108 sales in the second quarter
6116776 when kathy felton bought a duplex 20 years ago she dreamed it would be a home for life for her and her son but 20 years later the bank foreclosed on that dream and last week a horse trailer three sheriffs cars and a flatbed truck came to carry away her belongings
6116777 flo abke owner broker of realty executives in st clair shores said she knows a talented agent who had to leave for a job at starbucks
6116778 we add our observational estimate of upper ocean thermal expansion to other contributions to sea level rise and find that the sum of contributions from 1961 to 2003 is about 1 5 0 4 mm yr 1 in good agreement with our updated estimate of near global mean sea level rise
6116779 thanks for showing me those images danny it may very well happen and soon
6116780 earth science impact from the deep strangling heat and gases emanating from the earth and sea not asteroids most likely caused several ancient mass extinctions could the same killer greenhouse conditions build once again http www sciam com article cfm articleid 00037a5d a938 150e a93883414b7f0000 amp sc i100322 most of the article omitted but with atmospheric carbon climbing at an annual rate of 2 ppm and expected to accelerate to 3 ppm levels could approach 900 ppm by the end of the next century and conditions that bring about the beginnings of ocean anoxia may be in place how soon after that could there be a new greenhouse extinction that is something our society should never find out
6116781 in the end permian as the levels of atmospheric oxygen fell and
6116782 i really dont think humans are in danger of extinction
6116783 all coal fired power plants must be converted to nuclear immediately
6116784 is there a hypothalmus in the earths biosystem that serves to regulate and reset optimal temperature to make a comparison system function that is found in humans
6116785 all coal fired power plants must be converted to nuclear immediately
6116786 since it is impossible then we are all doomed there is no way that we are going to take the action needed to prevent the catastrophe that will end civilisation
6116787 this is an important paper with respect to diagnosing the radiative imbalance of the climate system i e global warming and cooling moreover if heat is being stored in deep depths this would help explain why sea level continues to rise yet the upper ocean has not been warming in recent year s it also means that the feedback of this heat into the atmosphere is delayed or even lost for a very long
6116788 no significant warming or cooling is observed in upper ocean heat content between 2004 and 2006
6116789 first from 2004 to the present steric contributions to sea level rise appear to have been negligible although the historical record suggests that multiyear periods of little warming or even cooling are not unusual the present analysis confirms this result with unprecedented accuracy
6116790 all coal fired power plants must be converted to nuclear immediately
6116791 so are we really supposed to believe that the models were working ok until a few years ago when they
6116792 and because models are built on our best understanding of the underlying physics rather than built to match old data models do much better than perform that trick
6116793 except as has endlessly pointed out this isnt how they are constructed
6116794 northern hemisphere winter climate response to greenhouse gas ozone solar and volcanic forcing
6116795 fits in 8mb of memory with processor much slower than laptop and costs 8m
6116796 1976 cray 1 first really successful vector supercomputer typically 8m or so clock 80mhz main memory up to 1m 64 bit words i e 8mb huge any current laptop could easily beat it
6116797 weve realigned the observations and as a result the models agree with the observations much better than previously
6116798 and so by comparing many xbt observations with research ship observations in a statistical way you can estimate what the errors associated with the xbts are
6116799 the ice core showed the northern hemisphere briefly emerged from the last ice age some 14 700 years ago with a 22 degree fahrenheit spike in just 50 years then plunged back into icy conditions before abruptly warming again about 11 700 years ago
6116800 22 degrees in 50 years makes the recent trend pale
6116801 what energy source could create such changes 22 degrees in 50 years makes the recent trend pale
6116802 such changes certainly do not seem to be the result of vulcanism or co2 what energy source could create such changes
6116803 rightly or wrongly i think hansens dramatic interpretations of the threats from agw are going to be the key media
6116804 rejecting outlier data without a lot of careful analyses and very solid justiication proving that the data was measured incorrectly and not because it doesnt fall where it
6116805 andrew if you look at what figen said i think you will find that it is consistent with your more detailed explanation
6116806 rejecting outlier data without a lot of careful analyses and very solid justiication proving that the data was measured incorrectly and not because it doesnt fall where it
6116807 i am grateful to you for emphasizing the statistical nature of outlier identification though its a problem i often confront in my day job
6116808 there is a divergence in the data between it and my theory what errors in data gathering might there be that would explain this divergence
6116809 what errors in data gathering might there be that causes a false congruence between my theory and the data
6116810 global models get levels of ozone in the troposphere about right so if destruction rates are much higher than thought that means it must be coming from somewhere else

6116821 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
6116822 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6116823 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
6116824 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins
6116825 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want
6116826 the withdrawal has to be completed by midnight on friday as agreed
6116827 regarding shevchenko there is no official news right now shevchenko is still a chelsea player
6116828 i do not think the russians are taking any notice in their current frame of mind they are likely to harden their position towards nato
6116829 if this is another factor which russia takes into account in making its decision to withdraw then ill be satisfied
6116830 it depends on what comes out because as we know russia controls the situation on the ground
6116831 natos impact is limited but it is not inefficient one reason is due to the fact that russian foreign policy is in a shambles at the moment
6116832 as soon as the smoke has settled in two or three months time people will try to pick up the pieces in this context nato has sent a clear signal
6116833 my fear is that a lot of pragmatism will be put aside
6116834 dont use two or three cases to blame the previous government and tarnish our name

6116907 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6116908 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6116909 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6116910 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6116989 the opposition are keeping quiet now because they are terrified of doing moscows work
6116990 but as soon as the russians are out of the country saakashvili is finished
6116991 mr miliband said it was a wise decision of the opposition not to raise problems during the occupation but he also said that he understood that it would soon be time for normal political life to return
6116992 saakashvili bears part of the responsibility for this war russia was trying to provoke us but we should have avoided direct military confrontation
6116993 im afraid it will not be very easy for the government to answer all the questions
6116994 it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat

6117009 excess excitement in the farming sector seems reminiscent of days past
6117010 throw in a federally mandated ethanol boom and the investment thesis receives even more traction
6117011 yet we have a tendency to be cautious of exciting stories that are broad based with many people jumping on the bandwagon deep scrutiny is often missed because the theme is so compelling and thereby must be rational
6117012 since farmer wealth is heavily influenced by real estate values such spikes should be looked on with concern
6117013 keep in mind that household net equity in real estate as a per cent of household net worth is far lower than it is for farmers yet everyone seems worried about weaker home prices for consumers and do not seem bothered at all by a plausible pullback in farmland values given the recent pattern

6117032 canadian independent power producer stocks that we follow have been hit hard over the past several months down 30 per cent on average
6117033 recently however many of them have partially rebounded with one notable exception being khd in our opinion we think its share price being left behind is unwarranted and presents a buying opportunity
6117034 on a relative valuation basis canadian hydro developers looks quite attractive given the high revenue ebitda and eps growth we expect khd to realize over the next several years we think these multiples are somewhat low
6117035 historically we had given up to 1 a share of value for dunvegan that we reduced over time to reflect chronic delays on a final decision taking a closer look we think the total value could one day approach 1 50 a share
6117036 we believe that there is no pending transaction to increase its share count and to possibly dilute its future eps potential

6117074 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence

6117095 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
6117096 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
6117097 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports

6117110 the bia concluded that petitioner had not suffered past persecution on account of being hiv positive and that although petitioner was likely to be discriminated against because of her medical status if returned to the gambia this discrimination did not rise to the level of persecution
6117111 the bia was correct that discrimination and persecution are distinct concepts
6117112 but the bia did not explain what standard for persecution it used in making its decision nor what understanding of discrimination it used as a basis for the distinction the omission is particularly significant in a case such as this where petitioners persecution claim is based largely on the anticipated actions of private individuals which she ascribes to the government because of the latters failure to act in various respects without an explanation of the agencys understanding of persecution and discrimination we cannot determine whether the denial was based on an assessment of the severity of concerns identified by petitioner or by the degree of government responsibility thus we cannot assess the merits of petitioners contention that the cumulative effect of societal ostracism loss of employment loss of family support and the possibility that as a woman she would be considered responsible for her husbands illness and demise add up to a reasonable fear of future persecution and not mere discrimination
6117113 some evidence that individuals who are hiv positive suffer discrimination in the gambia there is no evidence of more serious harm
6117114 indicating that she might be subjected to persecution by governmental and non governmental actors if she returned

6117120 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6117121 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6117122 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
6117123 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
6117124 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy

6117219 the key is finding the right magic during the 30 days of the tournament if pirlo had not been suspended against spain in the euro 2008 quarter final and had they won the penalty shootout maybe donadoni would still be in charge and who knows italy may have won the euros

6117222 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6117257 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
6117258 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
6117259 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
6117260 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence

6117266 i ran for finn valley athletic club i was the captain there for many years i guess i was a good club runner in ireland got a couple of irish vests at under 23 level and student level but no championships like this
6117267 its hard work we work long hours but when you cant be a professional in the sport yourself i guess this is the next best thing

6117269 hes a typical jamaican i think very laid back very very laid back in the warm up area before the 100 metres we were punching each other rolling on the ground he was laughing he loves playing games hes a young at heart kind of guy
6117270 hes a happy guy what you see on the track is real when you see him serious you know that something is wrong

6117280 om op internationaal niveau mee te doen is het belangrijk om ontwikkelingen te bekijken op de schaal van de metropool toch is dat lang niet altijd vanzelfsprekend dat het ons allemaal gelukt is om hierin overeenstemming te vinden over onze gezamenlijke toekomst is een groot goed
6117281 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
6117282 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
6117283 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be underestimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
6117284 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
6117285 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
6117286 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours

6117288 we are pleased to announce record revenues for the year but obviously are not happy with the net income for the quarter or year license revenue fell off dramatically for the quarter compared to last year and slightly for the year which had a significant impact on both top line revenue and gross margin our support and services revenue continues to grow at a very healthy pace driven by our electronic processing services which include atm debit card bill payment and remote deposit capture our managers and employees continue their on going focus on our customers while also maintaining a focus on cost control during this challenging period
6117289 we continue to develop new products and enhance the features and depth of functionality in our existing products to meet our customers demands which also allow them to effectively compete with any financial institution obviously this means we have to continue to increase our spending on research and development which increased significantly for the quarter and the year however considering the impact of the two acquisitions we completed last year this line of expense only increased organically by 5 percent for the quarter and 15 percent for the year compared to the same periods a year ago
6117290 we believe these demands are a good sign that our customers look to us to fulfill their technology needs as we continue to focus on our primary strengths of providing the most powerful and flexible technology in the industry and our commitment to provide our clients with outstanding service
6117291 our managers did a good job of controlling our operating expenses during the year we had a one time write off of some fixed assets and above usual level of legal and accounting costs in the fourth quarter or the total dollar expense would have been basically flat for the quarter and those combined with additional personnel costs and higher user group costs caused the increase for the year compared to the prior year periods also selling and marketing expense increased at approximately the same pace as revenue for the year but considering the impact of the companies acquired during the year they only increased 5 percent and 7 percent organically for the quarter and year respectively
6117292 weve positioned mediasilo as an alternative to old school ftp for video

6117294 weve been dedicated to streamlining the ui in mediasilo from the beginning

6117382 oh nat rlich ich m chte zwei von ihren spezial pizzen mit besonders viel fleisch bestellen
6117383 ich glaube nicht dass das gut f r sie ist
6117384 laut ihrer krankenakte haben sie einen zu hohen blutdruck und extrem hohe cholesterinwerte ihre krankenkasse w rde eine solche ungesunde auswahl nicht gestatten
6117385 sie k nnten unsere soja joghurt pizza mit ganz wenig fett probieren sie wird ihnen bestimmt schmecken
6117386 wie kommen sie darauf dass ich das m gen k nnte
6117387 nun sie haben letzte woche das buch sojarezepte f r feinschmecker aus der b cherei ausgeliehen deswegen habe ich ihnen diese pizza empfohlen
6117388 ok ok geben sie mir zwei davon in familiengr sse was kostet der spass
6117389 das sollte f r sie ihre frau und ihre vier kinder reichen der spass wie sie es nennen kostet 45 euro
6117390 es tut mir leid aber sie werden bar zahlen m ssen der kreditrahmen ihrer karte ist bereits berzogen
6117391 ich laufe runter zum geldautomaten und hole bargeld bevor ihr fahrer hier ist
6117392 das wird wohl auch nichts ihr girokonto ist auch berzogen
6117393 egal schicken sie einfach die pizza los ich werde das geld da haben wie lange wird es dauern
6117394 wir h ngen ein wenig hinterher es wird etwa 45 minuten dauern wenn sie es eilig haben k nnen sie sie selbst abholen wenn sie das geld besorgen obwohl der transport von pizza auf dem motorrad immer etwas schwierig ist
6117395 hier steht dass sie mit den ratenzahlungen f r ihren wagen im r ckstand sind und ihn zur ckgeben mussten aber ihre harley ist bezahlt also nehme ich an dass sie die benutzen

6117406 hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world large and small use these servers as the foundation of their it infrastructure because they are exceptionally secure and reliable
6117407 we do one thing as well as anyone in the world
6117408 we seamlessly and securely link merchant credit card purchases to order entry systems our clients are brick and mortar merchants mail order and call center operations and online vendors adorama of course fits each those categories
6117409 merchants work hard to make the purchase easy and stress free so that the customer does not give up before checkout but its just as important to make this experience secure and to protect both parties these authenticated payment options do just that
6117410 we couldnt be happier with the solution both mastercard and visa have lowered our costs per transaction as an incentive to take part in their authenticated payment programs
6117411 in addition we estimate these programs have reduced fraudulent online purchases by more than five percent our overall payback period was under five months
6117412 adorama has benefited from a team of first rate specialists spanning transaction security services payment software and computer hardware the team has delivered an integrated suite of state of the art card processing tools that are practical and cost effective for everyone from small shops and online merchants to huge web vendors

6117422 i am happy to publicly acknowledge this letter and my description of the concerns we in the common cause partnership have about the proposals of the windsor continuation group nonetheless it is disturbing to discover that at least one member of the windsor continuation group a body that is supposed to be working for reconciliation in the anglican communion so quickly leaked private correspondence in an attempt to gain some passing political advantage
6117423 i must ask you to direct that the money be returned to them forthwith

6117428 over the last week weve seen senator obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6117429 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by senator mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6117430 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6117431 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6117432 when the history of the last eight years is written it will show how closely and effectively my administration and the veterans of foreign wars have worked together on behalf of americas veterans
6117433 this legislation will expand education benefits for our nations veterans

6117444 not at all if anything the success of that movie will help us
6117445 we hope it will open doors especially for the 40 plus set in hollywood
6117446 i think 50 years from now when we look back on this generation of women who were told that we could have it all and tried to people are going to go what the hell were they doing
6117447 its very hard to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it all its incredibly hard
6117448 thats a really old fashioned idea its so low for someone to have said that they dont say that about men so its sexist and horribe
6117449 i may one day but it wont be because someone told me to i alsot think that the demographics of who sees movies have changed
6117450 women over 31 want movies that are about them so there are a lot of big surprises left the baby boom generation is getting older and it wants something more satisfying than why the movie makers expect
6117451 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
6117452 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
6117453 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6117454 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6117455 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6117456 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6117457 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6117458 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6117459 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6117460 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6117461 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6117462 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
6117463 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
6117464 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
6117465 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6117466 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
6117467 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
6117468 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
6117469 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
6117470 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
6117471 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
6117472 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
6117473 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
6117474 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
6117475 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous
6117476 is it good value for money only 33 of those surveyed agreed that it was and some 47 disagreed with 28 disagreeing strongly does the licence fee ensure provision of programming not available elsewhere not according to a clear majority of those expressing a view 41 and perhaps most worrying of all is it an appropriate way of funding the bbc only just over half of those polled and expressing a view thought it was
6117477 the growing threat from swarms of jellyfish around britains coast i
6117478 it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply
6117479 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
6117480 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
6117481 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
6117482 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
6117483 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
6117484 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
6117485 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
6117486 language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature
6117487 the team did not disclose patels match fee patel pleaded not guilty to the charge during a disciplinary hearing but admitted to speaking aggressively to the umpire the icc said in a statement
6117488 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6117489 im definitely excited were coming together at the right time
6117490 hes going to pitch his game and thats all he can do
6117491 the probable no 1 pick in next years major league draft strasburg sure has shown he can pitch at the international level last month in the national teams tour of europe then in his first olympic start
6117492 i go out there trying to get better every day
6117493 once hes back in southern california strasburg will have a week off before school starts
6117494 its so hard and i try not to think about it
6117495 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6117496 the president personally called rohullah nikpai and congratulated him for this achievement

6117743 i really had a chance to engage with dance academically because there were always two dance scholars at the pillow this summer they conducted pre performance talks with choreographers and other dance experts and since i was running the sound equipment i has able to hear most of those talks with people like trisha brown yvonne rainer and joan acocella
6117744 suzanne introduced me to a great bibliography on dance and the body of scholarly dance related discourse thats happening in america
6117745 since im a philosophy concentrator i was able to look at philosophy in relationship to dance this was a largely anglo american perspective
6117746 i know now that there is a real presence of literature on dance that is both academic and critical there is a way to participate in the growing tradition of scholarship in dance

6117761 it would need costly new tooling and offers little weight savings because it requires an extra metal intensive firewall
6117762 try to imagine the scope involved in having to print multiple copies of paper reports that need to reach a host of employees spread out over dozens of hospital departments
6117763 compound this scenario with printers jamming and reports being misplaced misfiled or lost before reaching the employees who need direct and timely access to the information and what you have is a paper silo nightmare
6117764 getting a handle on paper expenditures while providing accurate and timely report information to accounting and other departments is critical to long term financial viability and it is something that we pride ourselves on at db technology
6117765 we are honored to be working with kingman regional medical center and are pleased to witness the benefits that ras technology brings to their facility
6117766 we wanted an archival system so that reports would be available to be viewed for an extended length of time and we needed a system that was compatible with our existing data mining monarch software
6117767 ras was the only system able to address all of the issues in a single solution
6117768 with ras reports can now easily be sent electronically reducing the paper burden and reprinting of a motley collection of reports for example monthly expense reports used to be printed and managers would have to write on them to justify expenditures now these documents are available on ras enabling managers to electronically send a report to accounting the bottom line is a huge cost savings in time paper and manual labor
6117769 we credit db technology with providing us an easy to use easy to maintain solution that is backed by optimized security and superior customer service paper silos are a thing of the past
6117770 an examination of the differences or gaps and not just the absolute numbers gives us some indication of how employees view the desirability of their employers products and competitiveness contrasted with how well they feel they are being managed and the future of their organizations viewed in this manner employees in spain japan russia and italy are leaning more strongly toward quality and attractiveness of their products while employees in germany and india lean more toward being effectively managed
6117771 however japan 44 italy 48 france 57 and the united kingdom 58 more traditional economies had the greatest concerns about their employers industries while three rapidly expanding economies india 79 brazil 73 and china 70 reported the most confidence
6117772 today russia has products that are critical to the worlds economy but the industries in which these organizations are operating are not necessarily viewed as healthy

6117781 no matter which presidential candidate american voters choose in november we need to begin planning now for the issues our country must focus on when the new president begins to govern all areas of american policy present challenges but the challenges in the national security arena are particularly acute and critical to the nation
6117782 this will be the first presidential transition to occur during a time of war in many years in addition the next administration will face enormous budget pressures caused by an increase in the national debt that will have nearly doubled since 2001 and a 2009 deficit that omb currently projects will be the largest in history 482 billion the next administration will also face enduring and growing national security challenges that will require sustained spending and the partnership of the congress
6117783 in considering these matters i have assembled a list of the top defense challenges our next president and our country must address in order to properly protect the security of the american people and to fully respect the dedicated service of our men and women in uniform and their families
6117784 es ist ironisch dass wir anderen menschen helfen gesund zu sein und uns selbst nicht gegen krankheit versichern k nnen
6117785 we all talk about the problem t boone pickens is talking about a solution and hes put his money where his mouth is so listen to t boone pickens and our country will head in the right direction
6117786 i see everything american as good offshore ocs drilling anwr drilling yes all of it i want to see all of it i want to get off of foreign oil yes all of that
6117787 this doesnt have anything to do with exxon or chevron or some speculator running up the price
6117788 pickens big ideas for wind energy heard by four senators
6117789 theyre wasting their time speculators are not running up the price of oil
6117790 t boone pickens is right we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions
6117791 t boone pickens has done a wonderful job of pointing out to the american people what the solution is
6117792 the name of t boone pickens eighty one years old and he has suddenly become bipartisan i am happy about that i have great admiration and respect for t boone pickens t boone pickens has done a wonderful job of pointing out to the american people what the solution is
6117793 there should be offshore drilling if appropriate all the measures should be there on the table
6117794 we have to do some drilling lets accept the fact that we have to do some drilling
6117795 i think you would find a lot of support for offshore drilling
6117796 i think you would find a lot of support for offshore drilling if it was tied to other things like renewable fuels wind energy solar energy amp other renewable transportation fuels
6117797 we have to drill in more places as quickly as we can
6117798 and we want to force the leadership of the republicans and the democrats to come to terms with reality which is we have to drill in more places as quickly as we can of which i am a big proponent
6117799 i am not opposed personally to the idea of expanding exploration for oil and for gas and in those cases where it is appropriate to get down and find the assets that are available to us as a nation and increase our national security
6117800 ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production
6117801 first of all as all of you know im from an oil producing state oil and gas producing state and ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production in addition to whats already open
6117802 w e must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense
6117803 although our country cannot simply drill our way out of this energy crisis we must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense
6117804 guest column from senator tester energy independence this independence day
6117805 ohio sen sherrod brown who had adamantly opposed such drilling is among those warming to the idea he says any exploration would have to be far from the coast and that the oil produced would be used in the united states not abroad
6117806 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
6117807 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship
6117808 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table
6117809 are not ready to embrace the idea of bipartisan compromise
6117810 schumer suggested congress will not move on a large energy plan until after the election
6117811 democratic leaders in the senate also are not ready to embrace the idea of a bipartisan compromise on energy legislation in part out of concern about adopting a position at odds with their expected presidential nominee senator barack obama of illinois
6117812 privately democrats have been frustrated that obama took such a long time to come out with a comprehensive energy policy and that his new plan appeared to be more about checking the box than engaging in a larger national debate on the issue
6117813 a lot of democrats were waiting for him to come out with something and he left us flat footed we didnt want to step on his toes and now we have some ground to make up
6117814 but the gop is positioning itself as the party willing to do whatever it takes to lower gas prices
6117815 democrats worried about defections in the ranks are scrambling to avoid votes on expanded drilling and this week canceled a series of senate committee sessions that could have provided an opening for republicans
6117816 majority leader reid has decided that deliberation is too taxing for
6117817 dems on the defensive over gop push for more oil
6117818 democratic leaders have tried to stave off a floor vote on the issue in part gop leaders say out of fear that some democrats may cast pro drilling votes
6117819 republicans refuse to discuss futures bill without coastal drilling vote
6117820 but the gop is positioning itself as the party willing to do whatever it takes to lower gas prices the republicans say democrats are scared to cast votes on new drilling in the face of voter anger over high gasoline prices and they point to the majoritys decision to scrap appropriations bills to avoid a debate over lifting the congressional ban on drilling along the outer continental shelf
6117821 democratic leaders caught off guard by a swing in public opinion and undermined by some of their own members are scrambling to run down the clock on calls to lift the ban on offshore oil drilling
6117822 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
6117823 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship
6117824 theres going to be substantially more drilling and substantially more conservation sen mary l landrieu d la said of the plan her moderate colleagues are hoping to cobble together
6117825 ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production

6117832 guest column from senator tester energy independence this independence day
6117833 ohio sen sherrod brown who had adamantly opposed such drilling is among those warming to the idea he says any exploration would have to be far from the coast and that the oil produced would be used in the united states not abroad
6117834 sen jim webb d va fresh from his gi bill victory said that he is now making energy a major priority we need to look at all our assets he said suggesting a large package including expanded offshore drilling alternative energy nuclear power and technology to make coal cleaner
6117835 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table
6117836 academics economists say that the costs of oil is 20 to 50 speculation
6117837 its not speculation it is supply and demand we dont have excess capacity in the world anymore and thats what youre seeing in oil prices
6117838 we havent evidence that speculators are broadly driving these prices
6117839 there is little evidence that large investment flows into the futures market are causing an imbalance between supply and demand and are therefore contributing to high oil prices blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking the necessary steps to improve supply side access and investment or to implement measures to improve energy efficiency
6117840 if financial speculation were pushing all prices above the level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell but in fact available data on oil inventories shows notable declines over the past year
6117841 when an issue is this hot it would be so much easier if there was a single reason to blame but calling it speculation is way too simplistic
6117842 the truth is that increased speculation in oil futures is not a cause of rising oil prices but rather an effect of those prices which have skyrocketed due to growth in global demand geopolitical instability and constricted supply in several producing countries
6117843 if congress is literally going over the cftcs head and talking about imposing legislation or making the cftc exercise its emergency powers to limit excess speculation when they dont even know what that means i dont even know what excess speculation means
6117844 theres no evidence of speculative influence speculators are not contributing to the demand for physical oil as they almost always roll positions prior to delivery
6117845 on any given day expectations determine the price but the spot market also has to clear and the way this happens is that excess supply must be added to physical stocks even with fairly inelastic supply and demand any large speculative deviation from the fundamental price should show up in a noticeable increase in inventories
6117846 they can offer their drilling amendment and we would offer our own alternative both measures would receive a vote that is how the legislative process is supposed to work
6117847 we are determined to walk out of here showing that we are responding more immediately to a concrete issue which is the pain people are feeling at the pump
6117848 i dont know if were going to pass anything but we certainly better vote on something before we go home
6117849 democrats are scrambling to appear pro drilling even as their leaders appear dead set against reversing the long standing drilling bans along the atlantic and pacific coasts
6117850 privately democrats have been worried that they havent responded quickly enough to the mounting gas price issue especially since bush and congressional republicans have been pushing for legislation for several months and made the issue the focal point of gop messaging
6117851 surging energy prices have forced democratic leaders to grapple with dissension in their ranks
6117852 trying to demonstrate that democrats are not opposed to drilling in acceptable locales
6117853 moderate democrats who favor drilling are trying to persuade their leaders to come around
6117854 senator harry reid of nevada the majority leader faces an increasing uneasiness among his colleagues who have signaled receptiveness to allowing more drilling
6117855 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
6117856 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship

6117881 general petraeus is going to come to the hill and make it clear to you that there is progress going on in iraq that the so called surge is working will you believe him when he says that
6117882 no i dont believe him because its not happening all you have to do is look at the facts
6117883 hes made a number of statements over the years that have not proven to be factual
6117884 he isnt in touch with whats going on in baghdad
6117885 and for someone whether its general petraeus or anyone else to say things are great in baghdad isnt in touch with whats going on in baghdad even though hes there and im not
6117886 petraeus report will pass through the white house spin machine where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked
6117887 this week president bush will send general petraeus to congress to report on the war but before the report arrives in congress it will pass through the white house spin machine where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked
6117888 by carefully manipulating the statistics the bush petraeus report will try to persuade us that violence in iraq is decreasing and thus the surge is working even if the figures were right the conclusion is wrong
6117889 i think that the reports that you provided to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief
6117890 i dont consider the surge a nuanced policy its killing our soldiers at a great rate i think that we need to look at reality senator biden talked to you about what the comptroller general said and youre going to argue about it i think the comptroller general ought to be listened to he says youre cherry picking your numbers in terms of the overall violence i ask you to take off your rosy glasses you had them on in 05
6117891 this the petraeus plan is ridiculous there is no plan he may be the only one who believes this is a good idea
6117892 this is ridiculous there is no plan i ask the president and everyone else who comes forward with a plan whether it is capping or surging or whatever they have will it answer the two word test then what then what then what what happens after we surge these women and men and by the way he said general petraeus is one who believes he may be the only one who believes this is a good idea virtually no one else thinks it is a good idea
6117893 there is some accuracy to so called cooking the books charges being leveled against petraeus
6117894 delaware sen joe biden said yesterday gen david petraeus is not betraying us as a liberal activist group charges but the democratic presidential hopeful did not reject charges that the military commander is using selected statistics to do the white houses bidding there is some accuracy to so called cooking the books charges being leveled against petraeus biden who chairs the senate foreign relations committee said yesterday in a telephone interview from washington
6117895 i think the general will present the facts with respect to the statistics and the tactical successes or situations as he sees them but none of us should be fooled not the american people not you in the media not us in congress we should not be fooled into this tactical success debate thats not what this is about
6117896 well let me well i dont think general petraeus has an independent view in that sense general petraeus is there to succeed he may say the progress is uneven he may say its substantial i dont know what he will say you can be sure well listen to it but i dont think hes an independent evaluator
6117897 asking general petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper
6117898 today general petraeus once again came to capitol hill to ask congress to prolong our involvement in iraqs civil war his assessment of the situation in iraq was positive but not independent the simple fact is that asking general petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper
6117899 that there are questions about gen petraeus report is not surprising the whack a mole strategy has made this the bloodiest summer of the war
6117900 the fact that there are questions about gen petraeus report is not surprising given that it was brought to you by this white house in contrast independent report after report indicates that the whack a mole strategy has made this the bloodiest summer of the war
6117901 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
6117902 still 73 of the more than 1 000 americans surveyed from june 26 to 29 said they favored an expansion of offshore drilling for oil and natural gas in protected u s waters even though many environmental advocacy groups have deemed offshore drilling as hazardous to the environment
6117903 for example just over three quarters 76 percent support immediately increasing oil drilling in the united states a position recently espoused by presumptive republican nominee john mccain more than seven in 10 democrats 71 percent also hold this view
6117904 t he percentage of liberals who said expanding energy exploration was their most important priority doubled from 22 percent in february to 45 percent
6117905 t he number of people favoring drilling there increased to 50 percent compared to 42 percent last february
6117906 amid record gas prices public support for greater energy exploration is spiking much of the increase in support for energy exploration has come among groups that previously viewed this as a less important priority than energy conservation young people liberals independents democrats women and people who have attended college fully half of people ages 18 to 29 51 now say expanding energy exploration is a more important priority for energy policy than increasing energy conservation and regulation only about a quarter of young people 26 expressed this view in february the proportion of liberals who say expanded energy exploration is the more important priority also has doubled from 22 to 45
6117907 in a rather dramatic show of force 22 senate republicans attended a news conference in a grassy park outside the senate office buildings to trumpet the gas price reduction act of 2008 most of them did not get a chance to speak underscoring their dedication to the issue since most senators do not relish playing a backdrop role

6117911 exploring these coastal areas could have an immediate impact at the pump
6117912 off limits coastal areas are estimated by the u s department of the interior to hold close to 19 billion barrels of recoverable oil as well as substantial supplies of natural gas exploring these coastal areas could have an immediate impact at the pump just the possibility that domestic oil supplies are expanding likely would deter speculators sending prices down

6117919 separately senate republicans proposed a revised energy package thursday that would allow states to petition the interior department to lift the federal offshore drilling moratorium off their coasts 50 miles from shore
6117920 senate republicans unveiled an ambitious energy bill thursday expected to establish a unified message on soaring gas prices leading up to the november elections

6118026 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
6118027 it is also probably one of the worst offences by any manager in the premier league to date and is unbelievably hypocritical given his recent comments in respect of cristiano ronaldo and real madrid as a result we have today made an official complaint to the premier league about the conduct of manchester united

6118033 it seems a pattern has emerged where mr goldstein and other funded agitators pop up when necessary to run interference for the corzine administration and other democrats when they are either considering unpopular proposals such as their highly controversial asset monetization scheme or an officials low performance ratings

6118035 in america you dont take public referenda on voting rights womens rights the right to have a society free of prejudice civil unions are as offensive to gay people as separate facilities would be to other groups based on who they are

6118046 all travelers crossing land borders will need to present a machine readable document such as a passport or a drivers license with a radio frequency identification chip
6118047 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6118048 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6118049 when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information
6118050 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6118051 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use

6118061 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6118062 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it mindarus ebayi
6118063 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days

6118146 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6118147 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6118148 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6118149 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6118150 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6118151 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6118152 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6118153 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6118154 you must make allowance for each others faults and forgive the person who offends you remember the lord forgave you so you must forgive others
6118155 na manh desta quarta feira t nhamos 55 pacientes para uma equipe composta por uma enfermeira para a sala de recupera o e seis t cnicos de enfermagem essa quantidade insuficiente para atender de forma adequada e os pacientes reclamam chegando at a ficar agressivos
6118156 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6118157 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6118158 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6118159 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6118160 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6118161 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6118162 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6118163 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6118164 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6118165 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6118166 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6118167 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6118168 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6118169 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6118170 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6118171 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6118172 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6118173 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6118174 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6118175 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6118176 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6118177 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6118178 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6118179 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6118180 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6118181 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6118182 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6118183 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6118184 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6118185 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6118186 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6118187 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6118188 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6118189 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6118190 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6118191 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6118192 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6118193 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6118194 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6118195 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6118196 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6118197 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6118198 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6118199 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6118200 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6118201 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6118202 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6118203 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6118204 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6118205 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6118206 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6118207 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6118208 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6118209 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6118210 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6118211 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6118212 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6118213 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6118214 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6118215 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6118216 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6118217 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6118218 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6118219 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6118220 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6118221 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6118222 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6118223 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6118224 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6118225 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6118226 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6118227 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6118228 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6118229 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6118230 i tell people to write it the way you want it
6118231 wikis allow for real time collaboration on the generation of a document
6118232 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
6118233 its blogs wikis social networking search capabilities it has changed the tenor of communications
6118234 and everybody has a common understanding of whats going on
6118235 its an effective way to communicate with a work force thats distributed around the world
6118236 increasingly dod it managers are creating rss feeds from databases such as an ied attack database or a significant actions database
6118237 initial progress may be slow but will accelerate as barriers to broad based information sharing are overcome
6118238 if you have expertise on a subject you can contribute to a topical page with other experts working that issue in different organizations and immediately youve made a connection with others who you may not have known otherwise
6118239 simulation based training is social interactive adaptable in real time globally distributed collaborative and heavily reliant on digital data it shares many characteristics with the new social media that have been labeled web 2 0
6118240 the physical and behavioral reality of the world and provide an always on environment in which to execute training
6118241 with models that represent the physics of object movement weapon exchange the consumption of supplies and hundreds of other operations
6118242 numerous face to face meetings teleconferences presentations and white boardings
6118243 by tools like google maps google earth and google docs these would allow the display of geographic information in 3 d and 2 d forms as well as displaying sequences of map images
6118244 could be captured as mp3 or avi files which could be posted and shared via youtube and screenshots could be distributed via flickr
6118245 were walking slowly toward web 2 0 not running because we have to protect the network
6118246 in an ideal world the folks who deal with security in the military would unplug everything from the web theyre most concerned about what they dont know they dont know wheres the information coming from is it false those kinds of checks often dont exist in this arena it makes them nervous
6118247 kids in college today grew up with it its ubiquitous to them they cannot relate to a non internet noncomputer world
6118248 if the government doesnt get better at understanding how the internet is evolving and find ways to let people use those tools to do their jobs on the battlefield or at the general services administration its going to be less attractive
6118249 yo me voy a mantener firme en el tim n
6118250 yo me voy a mantener firme en el tim n yo se que hay algunos que sue an que yo no est en la papeleta yo les quiero decir que eso es algo que en la democracia lo decide el pueblo de puerto rico
6118251 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6118252 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6118253 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6118254 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6118255 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6118256 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6118257 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6118258 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6118259 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6118260 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6118261 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6118262 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6118263 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6118264 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6118265 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6118266 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6118267 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6118268 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6118269 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6118270 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6118271 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6118272 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6118273 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6118274 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6118275 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6118276 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6118277 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6118278 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6118279 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6118280 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6118281 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6118282 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6118283 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6118284 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6118285 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6118286 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6118287 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6118288 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6118289 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6118290 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6118291 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6118292 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6118293 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6118294 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6118295 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6118296 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6118297 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6118298 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6118299 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6118300 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6118301 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6118302 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6118303 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6118304 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6118305 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6118306 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6118307 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6118308 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6118309 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6118310 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6118311 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6118312 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6118313 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6118314 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6118315 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6118316 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6118317 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6118318 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6118319 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6118320 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6118321 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6118322 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6118323 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6118324 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6118325 this is a planning took where all things are going
6118326 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6118327 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6118328 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6118329 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6118330 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6118331 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6118332 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6118333 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6118334 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6118335 could satan have offered jesus all the worlds governments if they didnt belong to him
6118336 let me leave you with this wanderers id like to give your church 30 000
6118337 i also have bad news for you i just offered you something that i dont have and cant actually give you
6118338 an article on a playstation blog that weve never come across before until today
6118339 as with all rushed sequels the new testament lacks the quirky sense of high drama of the original
6118340 although i understand that i must walk through the pain not around it i affirm my right to do so in a medicated state

6118347 youve still got the memories of what could have been what should have been what might have been
6118348 im sick and tired of talking about the 1972 olympics
6118349 they the soviets were the better team they should have won
6118350 they averaged 28 years of age it was their third olympics to play together it was the best russian olympic team ever
6118351 and we didnt even have our best team there although we played as well as we could play bill walton the 6 foot 10 all american center from ucla didnt play and the best re bounder in the country wouldnt stand for the national anthem so we didnt take him
6118352 even at that we had a chance mr iba henry iba the u s coach called it he said they the soviets would give it to us in the end theyd choke
6118353 that was not one of our better games there werent many highlights
6118354 we played much better against cuba and also against italy in the semifinals
6118355 it was a slow physical game dwight jones got kicked out and jim brewer got knocked out
6118356 the scorebook never was signed by the referees to make it official there was nothing wrong with the refs it the injustice was at the scorers table
6118357 i was there coach haskins and coach iba were there there was a lot of yelling and screaming obviously there was a language barrier we lost the game by a 3 2 vote of olympic officials
6118358 we won the game and then lost it via discussions among olympic officials when mr iba and i left the arena that night about 2 or 3 in the morning we had won they voted about 5 oclock that morning and when we woke up we had lost it
6118359 i do remember us watching the awards ceremony on television the next day

6118371 neincasarea in termenul legal de prescriptie de catre institutul cultural roman a contravalorii revistelor si a cartilor expediate clientilor ceea ce a contribuit la crearea unui prejudiciu total in suma de 33 1 milioane lei inclusiv foloase nerealizate
6118372 abaterile au fost generate de faptul ca livrarea de carti catre clienti a fost efectuata fara ca intre furnizor si beneficiari sa existe contracte prin care sa se stabileasca conform prevederilor legale drepturile si obligatiile partilor iar in cazurile in care au existat contracte incheiate acestea nu au avut prevazute clauze asiguratorii si nici nu s a urmarit incasarea in termenul de prescriptie

6118379 ilustrata superlativ de cazul basescu in care orgoliile mitocanesti interesele de gasca proasta crestere incompetenta si nerusinarea isi dau gratios mana viata politica de la noi pare tot mai mult o afacere intre mafioti clientelismul generalizat teama pierderii privilegiilor de la cele marunte la cele inimaginabil de mari reflexele totalitare fac din romania o tara in care normalitatea e tot mai mult exceptia si nu regula
6118380 as fi extrem de curios sa vad ce se intampla cu partidele care in acest moment au cazut la mijloc intre aceste extreme precum partidul democrat
6118381 pd a fost de fiecare data eroul daca nu chiar initiatorul crizelor din coalitie
6118382 sunt departe de a impartasi simpatia multora dintre gazetari fata de fostul capitan de vapor ajuns multiplu ministru n am apreciat niciodata umorul lui cam grosolan smecheria unsuroasa a superiorului care se bate pe burta cu subordonatii nu cred nici in marile lui calitati manageriale pentru simplul motiv ca prezenta in acelasi minister in urma cu cinci ani n a depasit in consecinte trecerea gastei prin apa
6118383 e surprinzator ca dl constantinescu nu i a inclus in lista invingatorilor sai si pe oamenii lui roman nu stiu si n am cum sa aflu in ce masura p d ul corespunde portretului robot al celor invocati de presedinte nu stiu cu alte cuvinte daca ei sunt securisti sau comunisti tot ce stiu e ca se comporta de parca ar apartine categoriilor aduse in discutie rapacitatea impinsa dincolo de orice limita duritatea si badarania agresiva cu care isi apara privilegiile functiile si fotoliile sunt de pura extractie comunista ele n au de a face cu democratia exact cum discursul pigmentat cu pilde marinaresti al d lui basescu n are de a face cu cultura
6118384 si a facut guresul domn basescu auzita vocea de stentor in vreo sedinta de guvern a atras el atentia asupra starii soselelor a liniilor de cale ferata a pistelor aeroporturilor nici vorba domnia sa avea pregatit inca de acum un an inca de acum doi si de cand se stie ministru raspunsul ghilotina nu avem bani pai daca nu are bani de ce mai sta in fotoliul de ministru ce nevoie mai e de un minister fara bani doar pentru a le da de lucru soferilor si mecanicilor de la intretinerea limuzinelor ministeriale
6118385 nesimtirea lui basescu and comp va atinge dimensiuni tropicale acum dupa ce ultimul ghimpe ce le statea in cale a fost smuls
6118386 sper de asemenea ca ofiterilor implicati le a mai ramas atata onoare incat sa l dea pe fosta sluga a lui iliescu in judecata
6118387 ziarele de saptamana trecuta au adus doua stiri socante abia inscaunat la primaria bucurestiului dl basescu a anuntat ritos ca nu va parasi locuinta ce i s a pus la dispozitie pe cand era demnitar al statului decat prin evacuare

6118389 vreau sa stiti ca romania nu va avea niciodata o astfel de abordare avem situatia din kosovo in care in numele unor asa zise drepturi colective integritatea teritoriala a unui stat a fost afectata priviti ce este in caucazul de sud si acolo povestile merg catre afectarea integritatii teritoriale a unui stat in numele apararii drepturilor minoritatilor nu exista asa ceva niciun stat nu are nimic mai scump si mai sfant decat propria integritate teritoriala
6118390 ne putem duce oriunde in lume a devenit o moda in politica internationala chiar ca sub matca apararii drepturilor minoritatilor sa se incerce afectarea integritatii teritoriale a statelor romania din acest punct de vedere este extrem de ferma si spune da drepturilor individuale pentru orice minoritar dar un nu categoric drepturilor colective
6118391 sunt destui politicieni care din interese geostrategice geopolitice incearca sa o acrediteze
6118392 aveti obligatia ca minoritari sa fiti loiali statului pe teritoriul caruia traiti
6118393 nu cred in unicitatea solutiei kosovo toti cei care au recunoscut independenta kosovo in numele minoritatii de acolo care era majoritara pe teritoriul kosovo nu vor reusi sa convinga pe nimeni ca a fost o solutie bazata pe drept international

6118422 icr a finantat acest proiect pentru ca este foarte bun si evident nu pentru ca sorin antohi si andrei corbea hoisie sunt fosti informatori
6118423 icr ar fi putut respinge un asemenea proiect cu argumentul ca nu lucreaza cu antohi ori corbea hoisie in conditiile in care partenerii germani nu numai ca nu au ridicat obiectii morale la acest fapt ci in cazul lui antohi au optat explicit pentru colaborarea cu el in calitate de codirector al scolii

6118478 to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
6118479 obama has frequently voted to finance the war but was one of 14 senate democrats to oppose a war funding bill last year after republicans removed troop withdrawal deadlines saying he did not want to be validating the same failed policy in iraq
6118480 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
6118481 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk

6118490 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6118491 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6118492 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6118493 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6118494 we must accordingly acknowledge that the books of scripture entire and with all their parts teach the truth without error

6118733 the government should be actively involved in bringing these culprits to book
6118734 what we desire are laws that protect women against violence
6118735 one of the issues with rape victims who dont know their assailants is that they are at high risk of exposure to hiv
6118736 the medication is not easy to take and it is not affordable for women you have women walk out with the prescription but never get it filled
6118737 women are not just getting the medication but follow up care as well
6118738 if you teach people who are impoverished how to get out of poverty that gives them hope and that breaks the cycle of impoverishment
6118739 the money needs to be focused on poverty in delaware
6118740 how you live determines how you care about yourself most people who have a decent job invest in their homes invest in the things that a job provides they wont make the same risky decisions
6118741 if someone feels good about themselves theyll be less likely to engage in risky behavior
6118742 whenever a group and a behavior is stigmatized and is accompanied by shame theres not going to be an acknowledgement of what the risk is
6118743 we need to urgently and aggressively educate our children about this disease with compassion
6118744 if we dont act now the data will not change

6118746 nearly three decades on aids has collected all these labels
6118747 may be a long wait for the next name change
6118748 ever be possible for national leaders to focus on a topic that touches so many hot button topics
6118749 remains a distant hope given the lengthy list of failed attempts
6118750 that should be reason enough to fight it but the world should be encouraged by small steps that are paying off and take even more of them

6118758 a modest increase in the minimum wage would improve the well being of low wage workers and would not have the adverse effects that critics have claimed
6118759 after a gruelling recording mixing and mastering process during the early summer dead harvest was finished however we are not entirely satisfied with the final mix and we believe it doesnt do the album justice rather than release something we are not 100 behind we have chosen to take a break and go back to re mix and re master the album the most important thing is to put out a killer album we apologize to our fans who have been waiting for dead harvest all this time all we can say is that its worth the wait currently the release has been pushed to somewhere around february 2009

6118785 ive got to imagine that the microsoft customers who took all the damn time to upgrade their machines to vista determined it was unworkable and then had to take all the time to go back to xp probably did so for a reason possibly even a valid reason and not because they had been swayed by bad word of mouth

6118795 la venta de abonos ya termin as que ya podemos hablar de esto con libertad ya recogimos esa platica ahora vamos a ver qu hacemos con el equipo lo importante era sacarle provecho a la esperanza caraquista y vender la mayor cantidad de abonos posibles por lo que despedir a carlos antes no hubiera sido conveniente para los intereses econ micos del club
6118796 es cierto que nos estamos llamando a algunos ex jugadores caraquistas para conocer su disponibilidad cuando surja la vacante pero ello no implica que el despido se haya materializado repito ser el 2 de noviembre
6118797 no olvidemos que durante las dos ltimas temporadas hemos despedido a nuestros managers malav y subero en el transcurso de la temporada nunca antes del inicio ya ha quedado como una tradici n para esta organizaci n la cual continuar este a o sin embargo es muy temprano todav a solo les anticipo que habr sorpresas en la designaci n del nuevo gu a felino
6118798 para el 2 de noviembre siendo optimistas debemos estar a unos doce juegos del primer lugar con lo cual ya se habr creado la tensi n necesaria para tomar ese tipo de decisi n ese ser el momento adecuado para cambiar de manager no ahora
6118799 principalmente se manejan dos opciones con igual fuerza dentro de la junta la primera opci n y las m s obvia ser a antonio armas pero antonio no quiere asumir una posici n que implique una responsabilidad real dentro del equipo y la segunda opci n ser a phil regan el siempre est disponible y nos contaron que el divorcio le est saliendo caro as que ese va a trabajar por cualquier sueldo va a salir barato

6118805 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
6118806 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet

6118836 how many americans would tolerate living in a place where one in every eight people has a chance of getting hit by a rocket
6118837 they see buildings going up instead of the ghost town they are hoping to create
6118838 both christians and jews share a culture of life they the arab terrorists share a culture of death and destruction
6118839 we dont have a frame of reference for the spirit of radical islam
6118840 thats why having tea with our enemies wont work the language doesnt work its like trying to hook a mac up to a pc
6118841 merely because the car they were shooting at went too fast or the bomb didnt explode
6118842 but even if we succeed in putting three or four terrorists back in jail its a success
6118843 it if werent for our court appeals more terrorists convinced of even graver crimes would be released
6118844 59 of the 199 terrorists didnt serve even half of the time that they should be in jail
6118845 even worse there are two convicted murderers in the group
6118846 my acquaintance with yehoshua may g d avenge his death began when he was 14 at a bnei akiva seminar to which i was sent in scandinavia yehoshua was from an assimilated family in denmark and through bnei akiva he reached judaism
6118847 he became so attached to the method of studying and the atmosphere of the land of israel and hevron that after the year was over he did not want to return abroad he stayed in israel and studied at the yeshiva and despite his lack of background in judaism his level of studies was just as high as his friends
6118848 he was like my son and i was like his father
6118849 you have to hear the responses inside the shabak shin bet to the release
6118850 they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
6118851 the chief rabbinate is willing to convert them but the government is saying it does not wish to allow these people to be candidates for conversion this is an unconscionable act requiring full cabinet approval every time a group of people wishes to move here and undergo conversion is a recipe for bureaucratic inertia as there is little chance of getting such an item onto the busy agenda of the entire government hence by creating a virtually insurmountable obstacle to approval sheetrit hopes to bury the issue once and for all
6118852 why you might be wondering would sheetrit and his cabinet colleagues do such a thing
6118853 the answer is really quite simple it is post zionism of the ugliest sort tinged by prejudice and sheer ignorance
6118854 decision of the sovereign state i am about to enable the state of israel to carry out the decision of the government even where there is severe controversy the ability to carry out this decision is what turns us from a council of communities into a state i will destroy what i destroy in the name of the state and in order for the state to exist i will do what i do in order to enable the state to make difficult decisions in other places and to impose authority in other places
6118855 what happened last year was a crime and i was part of this crime against the jewish nation
6118856 this is a man who killed nearly 10 000 people
6118857 and i cant understand why they would put him on a panel the people of gush etzion embraced us when the expulsion happened and it is difficult for me now to see another face i cant understand how they can do this right as were commemorating the third anniversary of the expulsion there has to be a limit to what they can do to us
6118858 we must do everything we can to avoid polarization of our society and the establishment of two states for one people as happened 50 years after king davids regime
6118859 it cannot be that a group of people would show such ungratefulness to the army for what it has done and will so undemocratically boycott an army general for his beliefs i had invested much time and effort into this event and it was a great dream of mine but im willing to pay this price
6118860 i was never too enthusiastic about the event to begin with because of the participation of yossi sarid former head of the anti religious meretz party and the like
6118861 i explained the situation to him and why it was painful for people if he would appear but i told him that i felt the decision was his to make to his credit he understood and withdrew
6118862 but it certainly is not correct to say it was an undemocratic move it was not undemocratic to boycott hacohen and it was not undemocratic to cancel the event
6118863 i believe that the entire issue of how we relate to boycotts and our anger at those who took part in the disengagement is something we must analyze and discuss
6118864 it cannot remain in the personal sphere refusing to pick up hitch hiking soldiers for instance is not permissible but to allow the public to choose whom it wants to hear is a different story the entire issue must be carefully analyzed
6118865 we are working in a period following an international agreement that divides the city into jewish and arab areas
6118866 in signing the petition i did not seek to change the status quo of the international agreements but rather to make sure that those agreements were being honored
6118867 currently jewish building and development is being restricted even in those areas that are internationally recognized as jewish
6118868 not the whole world is fighting terrorism all the time
6118869 what happens in between in many european countries is that they come to a sort of agreement i dont touch you you dont touch me
6118870 today we know for sure that there have been agreements of this kind not once but more than once
6118871 unlike gush katif the area here remains under israeli control but the government still forbids jews to come here this does not mean very much in practice as members of the homesh first organization detour the roadblocks every day and come to study torah here and to perform guard duty at night but holding a wedding here required official permission which mayor mesika asked for and received eight busloads of guests as well as 20 other cars arrived and it was truly a joyous occasion
6118872 the participation of former shomron council member benny shalom a veteran resident of homesh and its representative for many years on the council mayor mesika proposed that he be reinstated on the council even though homesh has not yet been rebuilt and the other members unanimously agreed
6118873 the council members spoke of the total illogic in the destruction of homesh three years ago
6118874 and expressed their belief and confidence that we will soon return
6118875 the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organization in gaza
6118876 the area to which you are planning to sail is the subject of an advisory notice which warns all foreign vessels to remain clear of the designated maritime zone
6118877 signals a change of policy or is simply an attempt to open up an official dialogue
6118878 since the foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza
6118879 hamas is capable of imposing law and order in the gaza strip and we dont need external forces here the deployment of arab troops would only serve to consolidate the split between the west bank and gaza
6118880 we need palestinian national forces that would be able to defend the homeland and not arab armies
6118881 the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6118882 in recent days the right wing blogosphere and rumor mongers have falsely accused senator obama of misrepresenting his position on born alive legislation
6118883 the state and federal born alive infant protection acts did not include exactly the same language
6118884 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
6118885 it is rather astonishing that in light of the new documents that came to light this week the obama campaign here continues to brazenly misrepresent the content of the state born alive infants protection act that obama killed in 2003
6118886 the apa report in fact does draw a very strong and dogmatic conclusion that cannot be defended on the basis of evidence since this evidence is lacking by the admission of the report
6118887 the question becomes will the pro life movement be able to persuade him otherwise between now and the election
6118888 wed be hopeful that hed leave bushs policy in place
6118889 not do anything that would be disruptive to what has been very important to the republican platform
6118890 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
6118891 the apa ignored or downplayed large peer reviewed studies showing a clear link between abortion and subsequent problems such as depression
6118892 professionalism and intellectual honesty are not concepts i would associate with this report
6118893 isnt it time the party quit this charade that it wants to make abortion rare
6118894 at least paid lip service to tempering the platforms express support of
6118895 non possiamo stare insieme ti amo ti ho amata e continuer a farlo perch tu solo tu sei stato il mio primo amore perdonami
6118896 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president

6118915 im sitting there watching him and im thinking this is a major league pitcher i know i can do this
6118916 not to downgrade him but once i saw him live and in person doing what he was doing i knew that i could do it
6118917 id have to say the down you get from failing is way worse than the up you get from being successful
6118918 its something youve got to be able to get past and learn from you see people make excuses and you just dont want to be that guy
6118919 his intensity gets you fired up to play behind him
6118920 every time you look at him you get that feel from him that you can be just as intense or as focused
6118921 wed like to get him as many wins as possible
6118922 he told me he was going to go down there and get it straight i think he needed to have a little team meeting with himself
6118923 hell say something and youre like where did that come from
6118924 and hell be completely serious i dont know how else to describe it other than hes your typical lefty and im a left handed batter but pitchers are different
6118925 he throws strikes and forces you to swing early that cutter keeps you off balance
6118926 i think he went into the offseason and said im going to do everything in my power to have success and im not going to worry
6118927 hes taken all the thought out of it its almost like a video game you press a button and it goes

6118940 it is a necessity for my name to be pulled out of that bag
6118941 i need to get myself saved and to get april off the block
6118942 its been my goal in this game to break up april and ollie

6118997 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games

6119000 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6119001 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6119002 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6119003 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6119004 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold

6119008 this is a tough one to get your arms around
6119009 what you dont see are the issues that go on at the schools videotaping of the special education kids that gets put on the web inappropriate pictures kids fighting and harassing each other over text messages theres also an issue of safety at schools around the country police havent been able to communicate with one another because of all the outgoing cell phone calls jamming the frequencies
6119010 id like to be able to confiscate the phone for the rest of the year after the third offense but we cant legally do that
6119011 im sorry but a three day outdoor suspension is a vacation
6119012 and are we really going to suspend an elementary school child for bringing in a cell phone or video game
6119013 if it gets that far after meeting with the parents then there is a problem to begin with
6119014 but we dont view suspensions as a vacation any more we connect our suspended students at the high school and the middle school with the juvenile resource center which they are required to attend during that time they are required to do their school work and make up credit hours
6119015 ive certainly had instances of fifth graders taking pictures with cell phones
6119016 ive had to have meetings with parents but ive never had it go as far as needing to take disciplinary action if i did i couldnt see it being more than a one day suspension in school with supervision
6119017 if they are in afterschool programs or activities theyre still in school
6119018 i understand that kids need to make calls for rides home but while theyre in school they always have access to a phone

6119033 its looking a bit better across the south east and central parts of the country this weekend it should be brighter drier and warmer
6119034 on saturday most of england and wales will be dry and quite pleasantly warm but as the extended holiday weekend goes on we could see the north south divide creeping in
6119035 it will be cool and unsettled in the north west while the south will see weather conditions slightly more akin to summer or the end of summer at least
6119036 while its harder to predict the weather on the actual bank holiday conditions will definitely be nicer just before monday
6119037 it should be very warm on friday and saturday with temperatures likely to hit 26c 78f
6119038 the degree of their injuries is really unknown at this time but the three inmates never were in any proximity to leave the facility
6119039 we do believe theres a high probability of a crude home made weapon or shank being employed
6119040 they assaulted those two maintenance worker one of which also went to the hospital
6119041 they got as far as the elevators and they were overtaken
6119042 theyre now in custody and theyll be under severe guard
6119043 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
6119044 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6119045 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6119046 they feel like this is the start of john mccains coming out in terms of embracing the conservative evangelicals
6119047 i think they needed to hear it and they needed to hear it when the question was asked in that way that protections need to come at the moment of conception
6119048 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6119049 most people they dont do this for a living they dont study a candidates record and even when they see a record it has to be backed up by the candidate talking about it and making it important
6119050 people were before just kind of wringing their hands thinking what kind of mess do we have here what kind of choice do we have
6119051 i think he stopped the ambivalence that was out there toward john mccain
6119052 when they see mccains actual position and him talking about it it makes a difference instead of looking at roll call tallies
6119053 this became clearly no longer that this is the best of the two choices and moved from that over to this is a great great candidate that we need to get behind
6119054 either he had a heartfelt conversion on saturday or this is more manipulative electioneering
6119055 what saturday night provided was the closest view of the contrast between the two candidates that weve seen
6119056 when you have eight nine ten eleven twelve candidates running it takes people a while to get enthused
6119057 when you have a choice between someone you agree with on 80 percent of issues and someone who agreed with you on zero the choice becomes crystal clear
6119058 i think he will come a lot closer to sealing the deal if he picks a pro life running mate

6119069 the flames were contained to the place of origin but the house was completely charged with smoke matter of fact with the weather conditions right now it was really hard to see the house it was really hard to see what was going on
6119070 just meet the deadline after doing the best you can
6119071 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons and dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
6119072 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons and dragons

6119076 ncsba does not believe that such a response would comply with the court order which is intended to restore technology funding that was wrongly diverted to other purposes moreover taking that amount of money from school operating funds would cripple the public schools
6119077 all we have to do is ask and we shall receive
6119078 but its going to be much much harder to turn things around at this point
6119079 we had the chance of replying to the offers of other clubs like manchester city but he as well as me said no
6119080 people were perhaps expecting djibril to move to a prestigious team and sunderland without being among the great english clubs are part of a league where clubs have all the economic power and sporting importance
6119081 with sunderland it isnt an impulsive thing but as he came to the end of this transfer window he wanted to leave and showed a massive desire to play
6119082 it is that more than his divorce from om that is in his mind at the moment
6119083 it is a chance for him to get his life back in order as far as his career and as far as the france team is concerned
6119084 everyone knows that his absence from the euros mortified him and he was fearing he would lose his place for good with les bleus if he stayed on the bench here
6119085 all these elements have played their part in this choice he has made and to which we have responded favourably
6119086 eric gerets who agreed to this loan said to me very clearly that he already has solutions within his current group
6119087 elliot grandin has demonstrated his ability as he fights for his place in the side and the boy karim ziani has shown his worth in pre season and against auxerre in sundays 4 0 win
6119088 we will see together if there is a need to find someone who has a profile like djibrils but we have time for that
6119089 shevchenko in the rossoneri shirt there really isnt much more to be done
6119090 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible
6119091 i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6119092 he was known as quite an expert in the area of health care and health care delivery so he provided a lot of leadership there as a member and actually even during his very first term because he had a strong background there
6119093 he combined a brilliant mind for scholarship with an usual ability to apply theory and research as a public servant in numerous policy making positions both in minnesota and at the national level

6119109 support george bush 95 per cent of the time keep spending 10 billion a month for the war in iraq
6119110 i was sitting here at 8pm seven was on the air and the temperature inside the stadium was more than 50 degrees
6119111 a number of commentary positions of broadcasters in the stadium literally fell over melted
6119112 seven was one of the victims of this technological disaster for the first 20 minutes of the opening ceremony they were flying by the seat of their pants with one microphone passing it around being a producer i could see what was going on and i felt for them
6119113 it was a nightmare they lost all their communications in their commentary position
6119114 their focus had to be on keeping the show on the air with their commentary they did a superb job it could have been a calamity but it wasnt
6119115 we were fortunate to have our own back up system a couple of other broadcasters internationally were not so lucky
6119116 now that the process is understood its much easier but we were having to deal with policies which were changing so rapidly no one knew
6119117 the red sticker with the crown on it became the butt of many jokes there was mass confusion which got sorted out when commander ma came in
6119118 but it would have been great if china could say to the international broadcasting community that it has moved on that they will allow live broadcasts from tiananmen square
6119119 the odds of anything going horribly wrong would have been very very slim but their position on broadcasting from tiananmen square has been intractable
6119120 if china had been more open at the outset to the broadcasters about what it was going to be like these games could have been perfect
6119121 in the past few years sports programming has been picked up by pay television which has had a greater capacity to show their channels as they have had more channels
6119122 but now with the digital revolution everyone can multi channel this is the difficulty that organisations like the ioc and fifa and others will face
6119123 the pay television market is cashed up they can buy any sport they like but they cant deliver audience no matter what they might say and how loudly they protest they cannot deliver eyeballs
6119124 that is the dilemma facing the owners of these high demand popular sporting events
6119125 if they dont get to the mass market ultimately they will die
6119126 malaysia does well at the commonwealth games and it is only a matter of time before they win a gold medal at the olympics
6119127 britneys dad is furious he thinks its a big mistake and doesnt want anything to do with it but britney thinks it will help her custody battle for her two sons
6119128 this could turn out to be the biggest car crash television moment of all time
6119129 is barack obama exaggerating when he compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in u s history
6119130 compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in u s history
6119131 claim that his campaign is comparable to the great progressive movements in u s history
6119132 so the question becomes why journalists would compress obamas argument into a shallow soundbite that makes it sounds like obama thinks of himself as a combination of george washington abraham lincoln and martin luther king jr
6119133 this is everyday this is my job to get ready for thursday if i let myself get caught up in stuff i cant control like who plays sept 7 im letting my performance be affected on thursday
6119134 i dont agree with the signing we have enough trouble in the locker room and now adding another headcase also showing marvin lewis has no say in what goes on with his team since he didnt want him back typical mike brown
6119135 think it was a good no risk move low money move and if he mess up after this time not only will he be off the bengals team he will be out of the nfl
6119136 im the guy who doesnt care what you do off the field just show up and play this isnt girl scout camp this is war but to kick a player off your team call him a big problem wash your hands of him and then re sign him the bengals have lost all credibility their laughing stock has just gone up the only thing for marvin lewis to do is resign save face now and maybe you get a job elsewhere this team is going nowhere continue to prove you have no control on a joke team and youll wind up like former bengals coach dave shula go browns
6119137 i think we were in s for the last few years we all thought that we wouls come out of it but it looks like we screwed up again terrible move nothing against chad johnson or t j houshmandzadeh but i have an 85 and 84 bengals jersey for sale mike brown should purchans a traveling circus and have fun with it oh wait he already has
6119138 i hate it we could have used him but our ownership is worse than the bengals so we didnt even look at him we need receivers and a quarterback but arent looking for either go figure
6119139 i really wasnt sure on who to put the blame on this terrible move coach lewis fan pressure to win mike brown or the nfl in general im still not sure with dallas giving pacman jones a chance and all the others getting chances is wining more important some role model huh it wont make any difference other than completely breaking up an already fragile team with no consistent leadership henry wont stay out of trouble long enough to see a real game good luck with the saints this weekend and bratkowski you got your toy back so maybe we can see henry sign for nothing thank you mike brown for another exciting season of disappointment
6119140 chris henry the downside of all this goes beyond what you think im looking for what this move does to help the team in weeks 1 4 how this fortifies the center position what depth this adds to the linebacking corps how it adds capable bodies to the defensive backfield and how it puts pressure on the quarterback what does it say when every other nfl team most of whom have far better track records than you regarding personnel decided they didnt need chris henry
6119141 in the end you and i are just like marvin what are we going to do nothing yesterday was simply a day to vent and get it off our chest distance ourselves from the slime mike hired a player its his team and hes a re deemer but 24 hours later its not like you are really going to walk away not you not me not marvin you are not going to sit on your hands in section 301 and ignore a chris henry td you are not going to become a free agent and change teams you are not going to tune out and turn off ill still watch and listen why would i allow chris henry mike brown to prevent me from rooting for the only team ive rooted for in my 41 years i was a fan long before chris put on a bengals uniform and will be here long after chris exchanges it for a prison uniform
6119142 lastly theres a point going around that i dont much care for some are calling others hypocrites saying that the same people against henry returning will be the same people cheering at paul brown stadium when scores a touchdown its almost ridiculous to point that out simply because youre cheering for the cincinnati bengals scoring a touchdown taking the lead winning with a fourth quarter drive youre fans of the cincinnati bengals winning with or without henry so i say to those that are against henry returning rant all you want and cheer loudly when he scores its carson palmer throwing the touchdown levi jones protecting the quarterbacks blind side kenny watson picking up the linebacker blitz chad johnson commanding double teams and t j houshmandzadeh owning the underneath routes its the bengals scoring not just henry
6119143 were a land grant institution dedicated to outreach and engineering
6119144 it makes sense to support this industry that will eventually help students find jobs in their own state and support this clean renewable energy industry
6119145 students are already interested in the environment and how to help what they perceive as the problems theyll face when they join the workforce
6119146 so the goal is to get them thinking about wind and alternative energy as a career path
6119147 it seemed like the time was right for msu engineering and my department to step up and make a difference in alternative energy for environmental reasons and energy independence reasons
6119148 thats where students want to go and its the right place to go

6119151 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

6119158 couldnt get over the fact that there was no difference between sylvias restaurant and any other restaurant in new york city i mean it was exactly the same even though its run by blacks primarily black patronship it was the same
6119159 there wasnt one person in sylvias who was screaming m fer i want more iced tea you know i mean everybody was it was like going into an italian restaurant in an all white suburb in the sense of people were sitting there and they were ordering and having fun and there wasnt any kind of craziness at all
6119160 the federal government has released a discussion paper that outlines a clear agenda to severely impair business to business marketing
6119161 the obvious question is why in a period of economic stress and uncertainty would the government even contemplate such an unnecessary restriction of trade and commerce that would affect the ability of predominantly small businesses to promote and sell their products and services to other businesses
6119162 seemingly innocuous propositions that either all telephone numbers be allowed to be listed on the register or that all numbers defined as small business be allowed to register
6119163 the government would not seek to discuss these two options if it had not already decided that at a minimum the do not call register should be extended to the vast majority of australian businesses
6119164 what the government obviously does not realise is that the ability of people to pick up the telephone and talk to other businesses about their requirements for products and services is a major driver of commerce and australias economic health
6119165 if either of these options is introduced it will be a brake on economic activity that will affect both mum and dad businesses and australias biggest brands and ultimately it will be working families that are hurt through job losses

6119171 by consulting with local communities across australia we are seeking to ensure that the importance of cultural diversity is not forgotten by those deciding australias media future
6119172 sbs needs your the communitys voice to urge the federal government to properly fund sbs so it can continue to make an important civic cultural and creative contribution to australia
6119173 the government considers sbss core funding every three years previous government funding submissions have not delivered real increases in core funding therefore budget 2009 will be critical for the future of sbs and its continuing role in protecting and promoting australias cultural and creative diversity we face the risk of sbss unique multicultural perspectives being marginalised or lost

6119179 west wing sets were made from ca red wood trees and when environmentalist and politicians like al gore would tour the studio the management would route his studio tours and move the furniture composed of almost extinct trees out of sight or under tarps
6119180 when we had al gore visit the west wing sound stage we moved all the furniture made out of the california red wood trees and covered them over there pointing to an area of the studio lot with a tarp or re routed his tour
6119181 its an easy diss when people dont want to like me and want to say that im a brat
6119182 you have people who only want to be your friend because of that or you have those who say oh zoe thinks she is so cool cause her dad is
6119183 every time we did a take i would check if it was okay
6119184 jodie would tell me to let go and just do it she taught me to be comfortable on set
6119185 its not about the size of the roles its about finding things that challenge and intrigue you if these small roles will allow me to do that then im grateful

6119187 all of you lisen to what i have to say you must believe me every man woman and childs life is at stake if you see this film
6119188 the girl an asian and must have been a fall out from the mel gibson mess being that she eyed my last name very carefully before proceeding to challenge my resume in a room full of people
6119189 who knows but when i saw the unqualified white work force i was floored but just happy to back on the lot
6119190 so with the exception of maybe the trainers and one other person in my training class my skills were top of the line plus the personal connections that i had to the studio
6119191 these tour guides were pulling their carts directly in front of film cameras blocking shots and being out right rude to the public like most whites in hollywood they got away with murder
6119192 i had to purchase a subscription to the hollywood reporter just to know what was and wasnt taping on the lot
6119193 the vip tour dept at warner bros were not friendly to people of color the operational managers constantly stated that whites were the priority because this is who takes the tours
6119194 theres an entire generation of whites who remember urkel and asked about the show
6119195 the immediate supervisor in the vip tour dept after returning from her vacation and about ten years younger than myself informed the entire training class that no one was entitled to lunch breaks and that the jewish executives particularly cass warner the grand daughter of the warner founding father was biased and her book
6119196 the operational manager in the vip tour dept along with a sr tour guide guides who give five hour tours taught a class on jew hating
6119197 a sr tour guide trainer informed 50 of the class the ones who he was training that the warner jewish family were bad people and scum
6119198 as a black kid who was raised by brooklyn rabbis this created a slight argument when i informed mr aryan nazi that jewish males were black balled from bank loans which is why they open thrift stores and sold used junk this is the same concept on why hollywood was formed
6119199 in conclusion i had the most inefficient anti ethnic and racist departments recruitment center and vip tour dept throwing accusations at me and it wouldnt be the first or last

6119213 for years apollinaires work has been a source for me his poetry has a spark of life and a confluence of images that has been a rich vein to mine translating another artists work is never simple and transformnig work from words to pictures has its own pitfalls at times i started with drawings and found passages that somehow fit other times i worked from lines of apollinaires work and drew from and between them with all the drawings in this collection i wanted to make things that didnt merely illustrate the poetry but worked with the words to make something new that newness that surprise combined with a rich affection for the world is at the core of apollinaires project and i hope at the heart of this book as well

6119218 people that choose and want to protect themselves should not be prevented from doing so
6119219 we believe the police force that we have on our campus is best suited todeal with situations that might require an armed response
6119220 in light of violence on college campuses a change needs to be made to allow students to protect themselves
6119221 i support students who go through the legal channels to carry a concealed weapon on campus because they will be responsible students who should have the right to protect themselves
6119222 the bulk of evidence suggests that gun availability increases the likelihood for individuals to be killed or to kill another person
6119223 from 1994 99 75 of all violent deaths at schools involved a firearm
6119224 it was clear to the administration that our students and faculty would actually be safer relying upon the enhanced security we have in place than moving to allow anyone to carry concealed weapons
6119225 but anything could happen anywhere and ultimately a persons most valuable posses sion is their life and it should be up to them whether to protect it or not

6119234 with more than three million hoosier workers and nearly 140 000 employers the only way to make a substantive difference in the long term is to engage employers trade groups and labor organizations in the agencys efforts more can be accomplished through cooperative measures such as recognition programs partnerships and consultation together with rigorous enforcement than through enforcement alone together with positive reinforcement by recognizing those businesses who go above and beyond the osha minimums other employers are encouraged and it allows them to understand that there is assistance for them both through the agency and mentor companies

6119244 based upon the evidence to date the scrutiny the agencies are exercising to ensure compliance with the agreements and the deference that should be accorded the agencies tasked with protecting the safety of workers and the environment the conditions of the probation in the proposed plea agreement are more than adequate to effect an appropriate punishment
6119245 the sawyer report contains a number of allegations that misstates the facts
6119246 the allegations also appear to demonstrate a misunderstanding of the applicable law and psm oshas process safety management regulations and the steps osha must take to ensure the safety of workers
6119247 simply put the sawyer reports conclusion that osha has allowed acutech to only assist bp in conducting the audit has no factual support
6119248 fails to cite any recognized standard or practice which is not being followed or is inadequate
6119249 inadequate procedures for clearing critical areas of non essential personnel
6119250 moved the contractor trailers and the electrical equipment to another location a safe distance from any process units and other hazards of the work site
6119251 unequivocally that bp has removed all blowdowns from the facility and replaced them with flares
6119252 taken as a whole the sawyer report appears to have been written using information that is incomplete

6119275 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
6119276 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6119277 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae

6119289 terrible tuesday inflation surges stocks dive and consumer confidence nears a record low
6119290 the governments latest report on inflation sent a powerful signal that the beleaguered american consumer may not have faced the worst of it yet
6119291 consumer confidence is just two points from a record low
6119292 a real blow to retailers who are hoping for strong back to school sales this year
6119293 according to the survey 11 of respondents expressed confidence in the economy up from 10 the week before also 47 of those polled said their own finances were in good standing unchanged from the prior week in assessing the buying climate 19 of respondents said it was good up from 18 a week earlier
6119294 economists say the cure for this kind of pervasive price inflation is a bitter pill which is if more americans were to lose their jobs and have even less to spend prices would probably come down

6119299 to be on the lookout for stock piles and caches of supplies that could be used by violent protestors at the up coming democratic national convention
6119300 past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying abandoned buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm fields to store their supplies
6119301 be alert for medium and large numbers of these items that seem out of place for its location this could indicate the stock piling of supplies to be used against first responders
6119302 can also be used to throw at first responders and interfere with and horses
6119303 violent protestors are using 1 1 2 inch to 2 inch self tapping screws to secure the handles on these shields
6119304 the screws have been secured to the shields to act as an assault weapon against the officers
6119305 another tactic used by violent protestors is to sharpen the upper edges of the shields and then use them as a slashing weapon against the officers
6119306 heavy wooden handles in 5 foot lengths are perfect for swinging at first responders
6119307 metal posts can also be used to hold improvised tiki torches to deliver flammable liquid on first responders
6119308 can be used in balloons to throw shoot at first responders
6119309 they not only naturally swim straight but the can also easily swim parallel to the shore and the referee boats on the side
6119310 the current housing finance situation has dramatically highlighted the need to move forward responsibly and expeditiously with measures to help american home buyers

6119327 with two more weeks left until the unofficial end of summer and mortgage rates threatening six year highs little on the horizon suggests any reversal of the current seasonal trend through the end of 2008

6119331 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
6119332 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
6119333 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 see picture was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots

6119343 though there is evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record to date no firm conclusion can be made on this point no individual tropical cyclone can be directly attributed to climate change
6119344 numerous hurricane meteorologists agree that the historical data has not produced any evidence of changes due to climate change in the number or intensity of hurricanes particularly in the atlantic basin and even globally
6119345 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
6119346 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
6119347 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
6119348 but there are other factors involved such as vertical wind shear which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere
6119349 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
6119350 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
6119351 i am skeptical of those who would state those results as something like an undeniable fact for the future
6119352 i did not say if there is global warming it would be man made
6119353 not all scientists agree that the warming weve seen is necessarily anthropogenic it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who dont buy into anthropogenic global warming
6119354 there is now a near consensus that global air temperatures are increasing however there is no consensus on how this has affected the temperature of the worlds oceans and in particular in the atlantic ocean or how much of the recent warming trend is attributable to mans activities
6119355 recent scientific research indicates that in a future warming world the atlantic may experience two primary effects related to hurricane development
6119356 first a warmer environment may continue to elevate sea surface temperatures ssts thereby providing more fuel for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify
6119357 so while it is true that warmer ssts may lead to more frequent hurricane activity elevated wind shear may counteract or possibly even overturn this effect
6119358 which of these factors critical to the development of tropical cyclones will ultimately win out is the subject of lively debate within the scientific community and beyond
6119359 for example simulations of tropical cyclone activity carried out at the gfdl using climate conditions projected for the 21 st century indicate the potential for decreased hurricane activity under more pronounced global warming conditions and cautions against a reliance on statistical extrapolations of recently elevated activity levels through the end of the century
6119360 it is not clear what effect global warming is having and will have on the frequency intensity and geographical distribution of hurricanes in the atlantic basin
6119361 however models are less clear about hurricane activity in individual ocean basins
6119362 for instance in the atlantic some models suggest a long term increase in frequency with others suggesting a decrease
6119363 the evidence shows that there has been an increase in the average intensity of hurricanes in the atlantic since the 1970s and an increase in frequency since 1995 but it is not clear what contribution if any global warming has made to these changes
6119364 professor gray is absolutely correct that hurricane formation and development depend on factors such as sea surface temperature
6119365 however it would be wrong to suggest that these factors could only be affected by natural changes in climate and not by man made global warming
6119366 both natural climate variability and man made global warming influence hurricane formation and development
6119367 the real question is to what extent they contribute over the time scale of interest this is still an open scientific question
6119368 for the layman there is sometimes a tendency to regard every new discovery or scientific finding from the latest published paper as an inviolate fact
6119369 in reality rarely is there ever a last and final word in studies of complex systems such as earths environment rather science is a dynamic process based on the scientific method in which researchers test hypotheses leading to new discoveries but also reexamine earlier theories and try to improve build upon or extend them
6119370 there are those who want to attribute any perceived increase in natural disasters to anthropogenic global warming

6119483 we all deserve hell adams sin the fall explains why we are all sinners and every sin is an infinite insult against the infinite holiness of god we are all deserving of hell now you see that is where the modern mentality misleads us the average person does not believe that he deserves hell and thats the problem if we start from the assumption that we dont deserve hell and that our neighbors dont deserve hell and that god would be wrong to send us to hell then we have a fundamental misunderstanding about ourselves a fundamental misunderstanding about god and inevitably we will fundamentally misunderstand the gospel but here is the reality it is gods grace to be told you are going to hell its gods grace its gods love and mercy that you would be warned of hell and furthermore it is ultimately gods grace and his mercy demonstrated in the cross of christ where god made provision for us in his own son to provide the just penalty for our sin so that all who come to christ by faith would receive yes the gift of everlasting life will be adoped as sons and daughters of god himself and will avoid hell

6119588 if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement
6119589 the lesson of this experience is in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6119590 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6119591 this administration has used all these tools to stop new attacks

6119611 rechazamos la medida y creemos que debi haber un entendimiento nos faltaban algunos tr mites administrativos y se estaba haciendo todo lo posible para dar cumplimento al basamento legal exigido por conatel
6119612 las cuales se estaban cumpliendo y por eso nos extra a toda esta situaci n

6119625 yo no soy partidario de discutir estas leyes no es verdad que fueron promulgadas entre gallos y medianoche fueron 18 meses de trabajo del presidente y el gabinete habilitante
6119626 en la reforma ten amos previsto crear vicepresidencias regionales ahora tenemos autoridades regionales para poner orden en la provincia y facilitar la transferencia de poder a los consejos comunales
6119627 there is a two volume medical textbook entirely about muscle knots
6119628 a muscle spasm is an involuntary contraction of a muscle and is frequently painful
6119629 muscle spasm is a protective reaction to strain damage which locks the back to prevent further strains
6119630 one of the easiest ways to deal with muscle spasm is to have a hot bath
6119631 therapeutic massage can be uncomfortable when it is being done but the patient is expected to feel better later
6119632 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion
6119633 its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing research does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
6119634 als volgend jaar de draaimolen op het nieuwe grasveldje kan is het helemaal goed

6119638 new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6119639 hes talking about ongoing conversations conversations that happen this year next year 10 20 30 years down the road
6119640 as long as water is going to be an issue in the west there should be an open conversation among all parties
6119641 one of the most important environmental health and public safety issues for the american people
6119642 oh you have to travel through states i am for yucca mountain im for storage facilities its a lot better than sitting outside power plants all over america
6119643 supports the yucca mountain storage facility and believes opposition to it is harmful to u s interests
6119644 the political opposition to the yucca mountain storage facility is harmful to the u s interest and the facility should be completed opened and utilized
6119645 considering he s a senator from one of those seven states in the compact you think he d have somewhat of a better grasp of the actual policy making on the issue in his state
6119646 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford
6119647 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats
6119648 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
6119649 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
6119650 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6119651 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states
6119652 but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
6119653 mccain is a federalist who is for states rights he isnt going to touch colorados resources
6119654 and you know what the more i watched the more i knew what i had to do
6119655 watching cc he used his fastball command to set up the slider rather than vice versa
6119656 well i put my fastball where i wanted and everything else happened
6119657 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
6119658 katie thanks for helping with cleanup youre such a good subservient asian girl
6119659 i can see how you might think thats funny and clever because im asian and its an asian stereotype
6119660 i believe relationships should be dealt with lovingly so im not going to punch you in the face
6119661 but its not okay and i am going to use this opportunity to help you understand how and why this hurts people especially those who are not your friends because they probably wont do that but they might punch you in your possibly well intentioned but ignorant face
6119662 this is the busiest time right at the start of the school year
6119663 first you need a city permit for the rally then a madison police permit for the parade up state street then a permit from the capitol police to hold a rally at the capitol
6119664 would guess that the link between stress and ill health is reasonable this is not quite the same as saying that everything that the social epidemiologists claim about this is well founded
6119665 im sceptical about figures being quoted on the independent newspaper website
6119666 their story says 550 000 chickens are thrown away every day how statistically reliable is the report they are quoting from
6119667 400 000 votes spoilt was robert mugabe in london on thursday night
6119668 you do wonder if we americans are a nation of whiners
6119669 they need to make sure that the agent here in florida was not going to be held responsible if something happened to the bond
6119670 theyve taken the focus off of where it should be and thats on caylee theyve made a circus out of this
6119671 why did tropical storm fay strengthen and get better organized after landfall
6119672 the characters in particular are really expressive and seem to all be living their own life within the game also thanks to the day night cycle pretty enjoyable gameplay good tempo humor is often indecent seems like the music is pretty good too
6119673 why did tropical storm fay strengthen and get better organized after landfall
6119674 said he had made no claims to have discovered kafkas penchant for pornography and brothel visits but had explored why kafka scholars had chosen to virtually ignore the topic
6119675 the critics have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
6119676 images of a hedgehog style creature performing fellatio golem like male creatures grasping womens breasts with their claw like hands and a picture of a baby emerging from a sliced open leg
6119677 of course kafka checked out porn and had to stash it its a time honored tradition
6119678 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6119679 when vanity is not prompting us we have little to say
6119680 spain is simply the duke of edinburgh of western europe to be simultaneously condemned and patronised
6119681 spain itself is described by beevor as a country fanatically religious homeland of the inquisition and the autos de fe burning at the stake not bad going down this path we might define england as the homeland of piracy and slave trafficking which weighed so heavily in the nations formation and prosperity
6119682 i find his realism refreshing and a good counter to my optimism
6119683 i often wonder at what price would i sell the things i value most about myself for mr mangan it seems a share dividend is enough
6119684 dennis mangan defends himself against the charge that hes fonder of ducks than of his fellow humans
6119685 un blog inteligente punzante culto y a veces pol ticamente muy incorrecto
6119686 dennis is one of those versatile intelligences you suspect from the books that they exist but never meet in real life
6119687 there was no violence committed and no one was hurt it was an empty building
6119688 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6119689 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6119690 we will be asking the court to enforce fox s copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
6119691 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6119692 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6119693 l t is the best in the game so it definitely wont be 12 carries but whatever my role is i am just going to go out there and work hard
6119694 hes a good football player and he brings that energy that you want to the football team
6119695 hester he reminds me a little bit of michael turner just for his power being able to run through people
6119696 before i even met him i said hes a football player
6119697 thats the kind of guy you want on your side
6119698 thats what i think of myself just a football player im not too flashy and not this and that

6119700 rennen fahren macht mir immer spa aber es macht noch mehr spa wenn auch die ergebnisse kommen bisher hatte ich da ein paar probleme aber ich denke dass wir in der zukunft mehr punkte holen k nnen
6119701 es ist ganz anders als das alte auto in schnelleren abschnitten ist es besser es ist besser beim bremsen und es ist besser ausbalanciert es ist eher wie ein formel 1 auto
6119702 bevor man nicht auf der strecke ist wei man zum beispiel nicht wo die bremspunkte sind
6119703 wie bereitest du dich darauf vor auf einem neuen stadtkurs wie valencia zu fahren
6119704 das musste ich im vergangenen jahr oft machen da ich die meisten strecken in der gp2 nicht gekannt habe es ist also nicht das erste mal dass ich in der gp2 auf einer strecke fahre dich ich mit dem auto noch nicht kenne man muss sich die streckenkarte anschauen und versuchen herauszufinden welches die schwierigen und welches die leichteren kurven sind aber bevor man nicht auf der strecke ist wei man zum beispiel nicht wo die bremspunkte sind ich hatte das gl ck dass ich vor ein paar wochen in einem gt2 ferrari dort gefahren bin damit habe ich zumindest ein paar basisinformationen dennoch wird es wichtig sein das 30 min tige training voll auszunutzen keine zeit zu verlieren und so viele runden wie m glich zu drehen
6119705 monaco zum beispiel ist sehr wellig mit vielen absch ssigen kurven deshalb braucht man ein sehr weiches set up um bei den reifen keine leistung zu verlieren valencia ist etwas anderes da es neuer und gr er ist das hnelt mehr einer rennstrecke als einem stadtkurs das set up wird also nicht sein wie in monte carlo sondern mehr wie auf einer rundstrecke wie magny cours
6119706 wie kann man in valencia das maximim aus den reifen herausholen
6119707 das geheimnis ist immer dasselbe man muss mehr pushen als die anderen sp ter bremsen als die anderen und vor ihnen gas geben
6119708 arbeitest du eng mit den bridgestone ingenieuren zusammen wie helfen sie dir

6119710 we went to lunch and then we went back to his office and shut his door so we could talk about what i needed to do in the campaign
6119711 are tolls regressive according to this and many previous analyses yes but for transport policy whether tolls are regressive fails to fully address the justice and fairness issues that arise in financing road use
6119712 using sales taxes to fund roadways creates substantial savings to drivers by shifting some of the costs of driving from drivers to consumers at large and in the process disproportionately favors the more affluent at the expense of the impoverished

6119718 tensilica already provides best in class c and systemc based models of xtensa processors to customers who then integrate these processor models into larger virtual platforms
6119719 circuitsutra has the expertise to assist customers that are new to systemc in employing tensilica processor models and in creating models for the rest of their soc design we are pleased to have them as a new member of the xtensions network
6119720 we started working with tensilica because of great customer demand for their processor cores
6119721 as designers develop complex socs its important to model not just the processor but the entire chip we have extensive experience doing this and can be a valuable resource for tensilicas customers
6119722 we frequently heard that the words are pessimistic archaic etc
6119723 so we announced a contest we received many versions for the anthems lyrics
6119724 ukraines glory hasnt perished nor her freedom upon us fellow compatriots fate shall smile once more
6119725 our dear ukraine is flourishing like a spring field we are glorious ukrainians weve got a happy fate
6119726 it is an ordinary revolutionary song of the past times but everything has changed and now independent ukraine faces new tasks and challenges
6119727 its an old song its like a historical monument and its beautiful
6119728 but the country is developing times change maybe we should change the anthem
6119729 i am a rock musician and im more inclined to unite people around a common idea to boost peoples creativity as for my personal ambitions when the issue of rewriting ukraines anthem is put forth im sure there will be many national artists eager to perform this task and some may even do it pretty well but in order for that to happen there should be an emotional movement among the people
6119730 on a global scale its gigantic its a whole industry and its all because counterfeiting and stealing cards doesnt require a lot of effort they have a weak security system
6119731 if theres enough information about a card a pin code is available no one would resell it its very easy to use it yourself
6119732 when a server is in america a bank in the baltic states a client in thailand and a cash machine in ukraine its a challenge to chase those behind the fraud
6119733 which bank is going to release information that its system has been hacked their clients will run away from them the next day
6119734 hes like a ukrainian robin hood sometimes authorities refuse to extradite or prosecute hackers like him to america because they want to use their talent
6119735 competition among visa master card and american express is not strong enough to make them invest more into modernizing infrastructure merchants compensate them for their losses and little changes
6119736 we warm it up to have a shower in our bathroom inside of the houseboat
6119737 he says he would rather die than go back to our ninth floor apartment
6119738 it isnt stuffy like the city we dont have any city noises we dont have dust we are the people of the water where we enjoy the fresh air and the sun its all around us and its all we need to be happy
6119739 i have to rely on my kyiv friends who have apartments for a hot shower because it would not be right to pollute the river with soap and shampoo
6119740 during the soviet times the water business was not profitable and boat building companies would have sold houseboats to anybody who would have wanted one
6119741 it is impossible for ordinary people to build such a house there is no free river space from kyiv down to kaniv where the houseboat can be anchored all the lands now are sold and have private owners those people who built or bought water cottages 20 or 30 years ago are really lucky now
6119742 gli indici sviluppati per misurare laccettabilit della pubblicit in generale su internet e specificamente negli spazi personali dei social network hanno rilevato una tendenza verso valori negativi
6119743 il campione ha manifestato segnali di preoccupazione anche per quanto riguarda gli effetti sociali che la comunicazione commerciale potrebbe avere sia in termini di incitamento al consumismo sia in merito alla diffusione di modelli e comportamenti sociali negativi

6119745 er staat niet genoeg informatie op de bordjes en sommige dieren hebben niet genoeg plaats zo zitten de kroonkraanvogels op 25 m terwijl dat 125 m moet zijn
6119746 bij ons bezoek aan dierenpark malter in heusden zagen we bijvoorbeeld een dode cavia liggen die was al helemaal in staat van ontbinding en lag er dus al dagen
6119747 bovendien kunnen bezoekers er zomaar hun hand in de tijgerkooien steken en wordt het voederverbod niet nageleefd
6119748 een aantal dierenparken scoort slecht over de hele lijn dat zootje ongeregeld moet gewoon dicht

6119763 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6119764 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
6119765 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
6119766 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act

6119821 we thought president musharrafs impeachment might not take place and if at all he has to go he will be allowed to go in grace and some sort of a compromise would be reached
6119822 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view that leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this because it leaves radical extremist outfits the freedom to do what they like not merely on the pak afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
6119823 but even this more sober view does not amount to a coherent policy response
6119824 indias position is deeply contradictory on the one hand india takes pride in being a democracy and has joined a global initiative for promoting democracy led by the u s on the other hand it does not welcome democratisation when it happens in its own region
6119825 arises from a deeper conceptual failure many indian policymakers believe like their u s counterparts that it is easiest to deal with power when it is concentrated in the hands of a single individual or an institution like the army in pakistan in reality the wielders of power in a democracy are more responsible and accountable
6119826 it is futile for india to get nostalgic about musharraf he is gone and a new set of rulers have replaced him it has to deal with them it is hardly a sign of maturity to hold that there is a power vacuum in pakistan there isnt besides musharrafs own record in keeping militants under check has been unreliable
6119827 there is simply no doubt that musharrafs resignation came about as a result of a major change in pakistani public opinion which is attributable mainly to civil society activism to restore the judges musharraf sacked and to an increasingly irreverent media
6119828 there is nothing unique about musharrafs commitment to the peace process with india there is widespread support for it amongst all of pakistan major political parties and in the wider society the process is not going to stop because musharraf has left the scene besides musharraf recently became the biggest obstacle to the peace process because of his growing unpopularity

6119907 and hes going to stay there for a long time so i was right in recognizing he had potential and very quickly after he won his first race i told him ill stay in the business as long as you drive these cars i hope that ive got job security for a long time now on account of that

6119935 the union adopted a new amendment to its constitution at last months seiu convention requiring that every local contribute an amount equal to 6 per member per year to the unions national political action committee this is in addition to regular union dues unions that fail to meet the requirement must contribute an amount in local union funds equal to the deficiency plus a 50 penalty

6119939 resolved that president george w bush be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the united states senate
6119940 arent proceedings going to take place to remove bush from office due to the fraudulent elections
6119941 dont be the right wing dont be the left wing wouldnt you rather be the brain
6119942 as i listened to rep kucinich invoke the great engine of impeachment he listed some 35 crimes by these two faithless officials we heard like great bells tolling the voice of the constitution itself speak out ringingly against those who had tried to destroy it
6119943 electing your 2009 liberal government is far more important than impeaching the last one for a trial by a senate that will not indeed cannot convict a republican
6119944 kucinich is a true american hero his efforts at impeachment far from being a futile pissing in the wind are important statements about what our country is supposed to stand for and has not for a very long time
6119945 richm fails to remind you that impeachment cannot can not succeed with a conviction
6119946 kucinich is a true american hero his efforts at impeachment far from being a futile pissing in the wind are important statements about what our country is supposed to stand for and has not for a very long time
6119947 the adamant opposition to impeachment proceedings on the part of pelosi house majority leader steny hoyer and the rest of the democratic leadership does not stem from a belief that such proceedings would be unpopular
6119948 a public vote in the house of representatives would however find a clear majority of the democrats in congress siding with bush against the sentiments of their own constituents
6119949 the democratic leadership opposes impeachment not on legal but on political and class grounds
6119950 it would also inevitably raise the question of who in congress was complicit with bushs criminal conduct over the past seven years tarring democrats as well as republicans since a majority of senate democrats and a large number of house democrats voted for the iraq war resolution in 2002
6119951 more fundamentally the democratic party is a bourgeois party and it seeks to uphold the authority of the bourgeois state the key political instrument for the defense of the financial aristocracy that controls american society and both the major political parties
6119952 kucinich plays the role of clown prince in these proceedings
6119953 the democratic caucus is less and less willing to indulge in such charades however
6119954 the unanimous rejection of impeachment proceedings by the democrats shows that this warning was an empty threat in the event of a unilateral or joint us israeli military strike against iran which would be accompanied by a media barrage about alleged iranian weapons of mass destruction support for terrorism and meddling in iraq congressional democrats will roll over and play dead just as they have endorsed or permitted every crime committed by the bush administration over the past eight years
6119955 kucinich will go down in history as a brave patriot who stood up virtually alone for his country vidal is right this is the most important motion made in congress in the 21st century because there wont be any more congress if they dont listen to kucinich
6119956 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
6119957 scripture is a divine product and must be approached and estimated as such
6119958 inspiration is a work of god terminating not in the men who were to write the scripture but in the actual written product it is scripture graphe the written text that is god breathed the essential idea here is that all scripture has the same character as the prophets sermons had both when preached and when written 2 peter 1 19 21 that is to say scripture is not only mans word the fruit of human thought but also equally gods word spoken through mans lips or written with mans pen in other words scripture has a double authorship and man is only the secondary author the primary author through whos superintendence each human writer did his work is god the holy spirit
6119959 the early christian scholars trusting in god as the god of truth and regarding him as incapable of deception or confusion considered his verbally inspired scripture to be equally trustworthy

6119971 it is disconcerting that sen mccain would suggest that the colorado river compact be renegotiated since that would place the water supplies of new mexico and the other upper colorado states in jeopardy to meet the water needs of arizona and the other lower colorado states
6119972 new mexicans should recognize that this rhetoric is aimed directly at our water supplies and reject it outright
6119973 an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
6119974 he will not get a more fierce fight from a united states senator than he will have from me
6119975 on this issue he couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
6119976 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
6119977 mccains proposal misses the bigger picture that there will likely be less water for everyone in the southwest due to climate change
6119978 instead of threatening a diminishing resource it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration
6119979 hes talking about ongoing conversations conversations that happen this year next year 10 20 30 years down the road
6119980 as long as water is going to be an issue in the west there should be an open conversation among all parties

6119990 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
