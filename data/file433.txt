4330026 dieser rasche fortschritt ist ermutigend aber das zeitalter des digitalen ged chtnisses wird nicht ohne probleme anbrechen das aufzeichnen von gespr chen sowie das fotografieren von personen unterliegt in einigen l ndern und us bundesstaaten zurzeit beschr nkungen
4330027 viele menschen bef rchten dass solche aufnahmen vor gericht gegen sie verwendet werden k nnten zweifellos w ren digitale aufzeichnungen ein wesentlich besseres beweismittel als die menschliche erinnerung nach einem ehernen rechtsgrundsatz darf niemand gezwungen werden sich vor gericht selbst zu belasten bereits die erstellung eines ersch pfenden digitalen ged chtnisses k nnte eine potenzielle selbstbelastung sein die neuen technologien k nnen jedoch die durch sie selbst heraufbeschworenen gefahren mindern helfen so kann man die bilder oder u erungen unbeteiligter automatisch unkenntlich machen um nicht gegen das gesetz zu versto en
4330028 ein kritischer punkt wird der schutz der privatsph re sein die aussicht dass skandalreporter kriminelle oder totalit re regime zugang zu solch h chst pers nlichen aufzeichnungen erlangen k nnten ist be ngstigend ein gauner k nnte sich mit solchen informationen m helos f r deren legitimen besitzer ausgeben das problem ist qualitativ nicht neu quantitativ dagegen sehr schon heute k nnen die informationen die der durchschnittsnutzer auf seinem pc lagert in den falschen h nden sehr viel schaden anrichten und selbst wenn unsere computer gegen vors tzliche angriffe so gut gesichert werden wie ein panzerschrank bleibt als gr te gefahr die ungeschicklichkeit des benutzers ein falscher tastendruck und die ganze welt kann beispielsweise seine krankenakte einsehen hier m ssen die benutzeroberfl chen besser werden als alles was wir derzeit haben und eine intelligente software muss uns warnen sobald die preisgabe von daten bedenklich erscheint
4330029 als bell im jahr 2001 begann waren die suchmaschinen f r desktop pcs noch sehr unhandlich deshalb entwarfen sie eine datenbank die nicht nur die m glichkeit zur volltextsuche innerhalb unserer pcs bietet was inzwischen schon zur standardausstattung geh rt sondern digitalisierte erinnerungen auch ber zusatzinformationen auffindet beispielsweise datum ort und gegenstand eines fotos oder schriftliche oder gesprochene kommentare die der datei beigef gt sind diese metadaten sind h ufig entscheidend so findet man vielleicht eine bestimmte e mail nur wieder weil man wei dass man sie irgendwann im fr hjahr verschickt hat
4330030 es wird auch schwierig sein sicherzustellen dass man noch nach jahrzenten zugriff auf seine aufzeichnungen hat in der vergangenheit sind schon mehrfach daten unzug nglich geworden weil deren formate veraltet waren man wird immer wieder in die verlegenheit kommen seine daten in die jeweils aktuellen formate umwandeln zu lassen oder sogar imitationen alter programme auf neueren ger ten laufen zu lassen emulation um die daten verf gbar zu halten vermutlich wird eigens daf r eine branche entstehen

4330032 there will be disruption for sydney residents particularly those to the north of the airport
4330033 but the government in conjunction with agencies has made sure that every effort has been made to minimise that disruption
4330034 its far better than what was previously being looked at when it was announced just before christmas last year which would have meant a complete shutdown of the east west airfield
4330035 that would have resulted in everyone to the north and the south copping just about all of it

4330053 venezuela vive una crisis en lo pol tico jur dico social y econ mico que socava las bases de nuestra democracia el pa s est fracturado un gobierno con legitimidad en las urnas est usando el mandato popular conferido en las elecciones de diciembre de 2006 para vulnerar derechos ciudadanos que posibiliten el acuerdo en torno a la letra de la constituci n
4330054 el gobierno usa la legislaci n como un instrumento pol tico
4330055 fueron aprobadas a espaldas del pa s sin consultarlo y porque incluyen normas que ya hab an sido rechazadas por el colectivo venezolano en el referendo aprobatorio del pasado 2 de diciembre esta decisi n del gobierno vulnera la voluntad del soberano
4330056 a punta de decretos y concentrando progresivamente poder se viene conformando un cerco legal que vulnera lo fundamental de derechos democr ticos de los ciudadanos
4330057 organizar planificar dirigir y controlar el sistema de inteligencia militar y contrainteligencia militar
4330058 en la pr ctica ello implica que el ministerio de la defensa podr adelantar labores de inteligencia y contrainteligencia sin ning n tipo de control tal como figura en el art culo 4 de la nueva ley se trata de una norma abierta desaparece la coletilla de conformidad con la ley eso es muy peligroso porque hasta el gobierno hab a convenido en la necesidad de evitar excesos cuando se invoca la seguridad del estado para justificar la intromisi n oficial en la vida privada de los ciudadanos
4330059 en ese momento el objetivo era obstaculizar las manifestaciones p blicas contra el gobierno mediante la restricci n del derecho al libre tr nsito pero la ley con la cual se regul la materia incluye sanciones que alcanzan la prisi n hasta por diez a os por ejemplo ah est el caso del general carlos alfonso mart nez
4330060 un funcionario p blico no se podr a negar a este tipo de labores so pena de perder el trabajo de esta forma el servicio militar no ser a tan voluntario

4330085 its how you practice when youre tired that shows what youre really made of
4330086 win or lose the most important thing is that you gave it your all
4330087 youre looking at a nation that has suffered from 25 years of tyranny under saddam hussein and has not had the things that you and i take for granted
4330088 what we intend to do over the next 500 days is to take the iraqis from where they are to the next level
4330089 c4 systems communications as a whole are important and vital toward not only doing battlefield operations but also improving ministerial capacity and capability
4330090 you cannot just come in and overlay a futuristic template against an archaic system
4330091 we have to understand what types of things theyre capable of doing and what types of things theyre not
4330092 weve improved ministerial capacity and capability so they can do this on their own and we can move on
4330093 if you want a process by which the iraqis are going to be eventually able to self sustain themselves you cant just come in and give them a network
4330094 so when i look at what were providing in terms of education mentorship and training to senior iraqi leadership
4330095 i always have in the back of my mind this is something thats got to permeate down to those people who like this one individual dont have things like computers dont have things like the internet
4330096 i think theyre moving right along at the pace that is comparable with a nation that has been 25 years behind the times
4330097 we dont know if that would be as part of russia or as a separate united ossetian state
4330098 i would prefer there to be an independent and united ossetia but today it is not possible it is safer to be with russia the main aim of the struggle is to be independent of georgia
4330099 we became 18 because of soviet rule and russian before that
4330100 my grandfather was put on a train in 1937 with thousands of others and the next day a train arrived with georgian settlers no one returned from siberia
4330101 for russia abkhazia is just a card that can be played
4330102 abkhazia is linked to russia and russia is the only country that actually cooperates with abkhazia and today many are afraid this could lead to our political absorption
4330103 the threat of a disintegrating russia comparable to the break up of the soviet union in 1991 is still today seen as a very real threat by the kremlin and the russian elite
4330104 the west is seen today by many in the russian elite and public as a threatening force that is plotting to tear russia apart and rob it of its natural resources by supporting serbias right to veto kosovos secession the kremlin clearly believes that it is defending russias undisputed right to sustain its territorial integrity by any means available
4330105 if you are sick you visit the doctor he prescribes the medicine you take a spoonful three times a day and eventually you are better you are free however if you drank the whole bottle all at once it would kill you
4330106 it was the best moment of my life wrestling wise
4330107 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4330108 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4330109 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4330110 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4330111 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4330112 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4330113 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4330114 i can think of no better project than one that increases transit ridership and mobility by simply opening up access to an existing passenger rail line that today runs through the city of evanston without opening its doors
4330115 the governor has been personally involved in meetings and strategy sessions with state legislative leaders and others concerning prison overcrowding
4330116 with events ranging from the college world series to the u s olympic swim trials the national spotlight has been shining on omaha this summer then along comes the phone company making us all out to be a buch of hicks
4330117 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were
4330118 he was going to change his mind because he said i taught him how to love
4330119 hes killed way a lot more people that you dont even know about he killed dylan
4330120 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back
4330121 we might see you again and we might not if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake
4330122 dear dad this is dylan we are still alive we are ok and we know what happened to mom mark and slade and im sorry you had to loose sic a son and an exwife and im sorry we had to be taken away from you and i miss you
4330123 the day that this all took place there had actually been some unrest at the camp there had been some detainee on guard issues which ranged from spitting to throwing bodily functions at some guards
4330124 it atmosphere was a little different because it is kind of a home game for us but is so close to pittsburgh that a lot of pittsburgh fans drove to the game
4330125 i think its going to do well for the nfl
4330126 we have to get the crowd a little bit more into it and it happens with time
4330127 when the regular season comes its going to be different because the first team will be out there for the whole game
4330128 but to be up here with the fans has been awesome
4330129 its an exhibition game and in buffalo these are 60 tickets and they want 500 for them here
4330130 id definitely be selling more tickets if i was at a hockey arena
4330131 as a group we are eagerly seeking an open platform to promote our mission
4330132 working within the broad theme of bicycle culture we hope to promote aesthetics environmental health awareness creativity and community
4330133 is dedicated to those of us that have heard this statement yelled at them while biking around the city of atlanta
4330134 i wait wait and about 11 oclock about six of them they come around
4330135 to look at their faces they dont look good and they say sorry youve been cancelled
4330136 im actually supporting and calling for much greater accountability and transparency and performance indicators that tell us how often these kind of things are happening
4330137 mcinerney the royal commissioner made it very clear this was something that had to be worked towards

4330142 ok shes seriously changing right out here by the pool why doesnt she just go into the restroom right there
4330143 we seem to be the only country in the world that wants to speedily reduce the tariff to zero now weve seen the effects on tariffs over the last few years
4330144 an opportunity is worth to a person exactly what their preparation enables them to make it

4330146 s lo la gente con malas intenciones deber a tener miedo de nuestro acuerdo
4330147 antes se trataba de sostener la creaci n directa de empleo por ejemplo a trav s de la formaci n profesional ahora se busca la promoci n de acuerdos territoriales de empleo por lo cual ya no se interviene directamente en la creaci n de empleo sino que se trata de mejorar la din mica productiva de la localidad
4330148 tener en cuenta la din mica productiva como la din mica institucional del territorio haciendo hincapi en que los actores locales puedan identificar los problemas del empleo local y construir l neas de proyecto en ese sentido por eso lo novedoso y distintivo es el reconocimiento de la l gica territorial a la hora de producir pol ticas
4330149 la cuesti n de la econom a informal que es una realidad com n en las localidades por ejemplo hay sectores sin documentaci n como los grupos de pescadores

4330219 the recent blasts in our embassy have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4330220 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4330221 the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4330222 we welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood especially in bhutan nepal and pakistan
4330223 our government has worked hard to ensure that in india the rate of inflation is not as high as in many other countries
4330224 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4330225 however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth
4330226 this year we hope to send an indian spacecraft chandrayan to the moon it will be an important milestone in the development of our space programme

4330250 m s que cu ntos estudiantes con discapacidad hay en la universidad tenemos que preguntarnos por qu los hay pocos qu hemos hecho con la universidad para que las personas discapacitadas no tengan a la universidad en su horizonte de vida
4330251 los temas centrales a trabajar en la universidad son esencialmente tres accesibilidad f sica accesibilidad comunicacional y accesibilidad curricular
4330252 y ser la universidad la que deber encontrar los medios para que sus contenidos sean accesibles para todos por ejemplo la universidad deber proveer int rpretes de lengua de se as cuando haya un estudiante sordo
4330253 en el mismo momento de este proceso de concientizaci n
4330254 lo que nos constituye como comisi n interuniversitaria es trabajar colaborativamente
4330255 c mo hace el docente para lograr una valoraci n acad mica lo m s neutral posible de un alumno con alguna discapacidad
4330256 desde el vamos siempre se hacen diferencias sea rechazo sea aceptaci n con estudiantes que no muestran una discapacidad de la misma manera pasa con estudiantes con discapacidad
4330257 lo que hace falta es un trabajo que provenga desde la educaci n especial muchas veces nosotros trasladamos pr cticas segregacionistas en nuestros asesoramientos al docente hay que mostrarle que no rechaza a la persona con discapacidad lo que rechaza es la condici n de ceguera o la problem tica motriz y hay que ayudarlo a trabajar con ese alumno pero lo primero que hay que hacer es un cambio de actitudes al interior de la universidad la universidad no ha recibido estudiantes con discapacidad porque los niveles educativos anteriores se encargaron de no hacer circular al estudiante con discapacidad por los circuitos normalizados
4330258 entre la focalizaci n y la universalidad de las pol ticas p blicas
4330259 algunos nos situamos en una perspectiva de reclamar una mejor educaci n para todos y para todas reclamamos trabajo para todos y para todas y ese todos y todas incluye a las personas con discapacidades

4330289 you cant let up on them they always come back
4330290 this is the type of game of we play every time
4330291 were just one hit away one swing away from winning the game
4330292 its better to lose a game like this early in the tournament than later on when you cant do anything about it
4330293 on the first one i was looking for my pitch and i got it
4330294 the one i hit to right field i was just trying to get the runner over
4330295 weve got a lot of power on this team were a good hitting team
4330296 but if we continue to play with this kind of intensity were going to be in the medal round

4330313 the one thing i want to make sure we do is make sure kurt gets some time with the ones and i think the best way to control that is to start him in the game you just dont know how playing time will play out because we havent decided how long our offensive line is going to go yet in order to get kurt time in a game with those guys and not worrying about whether that is in the second quarter or later on i am kind of thinking about starting him
4330314 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4330315 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4330316 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4330317 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4330318 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4330319 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4330320 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4330321 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4330322 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4330323 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4330324 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4330325 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4330326 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4330327 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4330328 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4330329 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4330330 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4330331 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4330332 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4330333 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4330334 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4330335 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4330336 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4330337 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4330338 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4330339 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4330340 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4330341 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4330342 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
4330343 what if i dont want to turn into a fat stripper
4330344 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4330345 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4330346 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4330347 in many ways we still feel that shock and we cant find words to describe or to understand what happened and why it happened
4330348 the funeral home wanted some money up front so i wandered up those stairs where he sat up there at the top of the stairs and i went up to bill and i said bill i said i hate to do this but i said i need to borrow some money because i cant do it i need to bury my father in law and he said blaine whatever you need youve got it
4330349 bill was a great person and because of my friend and other people who work out there they spoke highly of him and i just recently bought a car from out there
4330350 its going to take all of us and thats why were here tonight bill was a special individual a special individual that cared about human beings and the betterment of the human beings that lived in this state all people that lived in this state from whatever status they came from
4330351 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4330352 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4330353 japans consumption is bad exports to europe and the united states arent good and it seems that the situation in china is likely to get tougher too
4330354 in particular the euros recent losses will make exports to the region especially tough
4330355 the trend for stocks is downward with the global economy definitely slowing

4330400 the war in georgia therefore is russias public return to great power status this is not something that just happened it has been unfolding ever since putin took power and with growing intensity in the past five years part of it has to do with the increase of russian power but a great deal of it has to do with the fact that the middle eastern wars have left the united states off balance and short on resources as we have written this conflict created a window of opportunity the russian goal is to use that window to assert a new reality throughout the region while the americans are tied down elsewhere and dependent on the russians the war was far from a surprise it has been building for months but the geopolitical foundations of the war have been building since 1992 russia has been an empire for centuries the last 15 years or so were not the new reality but simply an aberration that would be rectified and now it is being rectified

4330403 the bloody conflict over south ossetia will have been good for something at least if it teaches two lessons the first is that georgia will never now get south ossetia and abkhazia back the second is for the west it is not to make promises that it neither can nor will fulfil when push comes to shove
4330404 im just asking them to sit and watch because youre going to eat your words

4330406 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4330408 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4330409 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4330410 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4330411 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4330412 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4330413 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4330414 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and firsthand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work

4330431 i terminated a network connection cable inside the headset coming from the wire harness and connected it to the conference call terminations on the circuit board inside a vosip phone
4330432 now we dont need to get on our keyboard to type our request or take our eyes off the screen

4330469 this is one of the top 5 worst cities on the entire planet
4330470 theres not a day that goes by in my life when i dont think about montreal
4330471 sometimes people will see me in a restaurant and recognize me and every four years i go through the same mixed memories of what happened back then
4330472 it was a wonderful time for me because of what i was able to accomplish with boxing but its also sad to recall that it was when my mom died its more than just looking back at a great win for me its also a time of remembrance
4330473 lets say there were no championship belts in boxing if thats the case then my career was satisfying to me but am i totally happy with it no
4330474 im not hurt and i can still think and ive still got at least some of my looks from back then so thats good
4330475 i made it all the way to the olympics so that proves theres nothing you cant do if you put your mind to it
4330476 i try and teach people to always shoot for the stars because even if you dont make it all the way to the stars youll still land on the moon and thats pretty good
4330477 im not cut up or marked up or anything and when i see some of my contemporaries or guys who fought after me and how theyre struggling i have to say im blessed
4330478 you spar three or four times a week while getting ready for a fight and whenever you get hit pretty good you see that white flash which in reality lingers for about six weeks and then you go in and fight and see a couple more white flashes because youre bound to get hit a few times
4330479 with all that if you come back and get right back into training just a month after a fight eventually something is going to happen ive talked to a lot of doctors and they pretty much agree that 80 percent of fighters have some level of brain damage no matter what money theyre making
4330480 i think the times have changed and the networks have changed and theyre just doing things very differently today
4330481 theyre more family oriented now and even though boxing was very popular through 50s all the way through to the 90s the dynamics are different
4330482 for me winning the olympics was a tremendous boost its one of the major steps in your career you get rated faster and the exposure is tremendous but the guys now have to go new routes its all about getting the right team together and having a little luck
4330483 i cant speak for all of them obviously but i can be pretty sure that some of them are nervous others are anxious some of them just know that theyre going to win and others arent so sure
4330484 there are a lot of things going through their heads right now
4330485 i stumbled across the boxing in the olympic trials on television almost by mistake
4330486 but im definitely watching it at this point i wont have to stumble on to it again i think the team is set and im looking forward to seeing them compete and win

4330507 no ore deadly curse than sensual pleasure has been inflicted on mankind by nature to gratify which our wanton appetites are roused beyond all prudence or restraint it is a fruitful source of treasons revolutions secret communications with the enemy in fact there is no crime no evil deed to which the appetite for sensual pleasures does not impel us fornications and adulteries and every abomination of that kind are brought about by the enticements of pleasure and by them alone intellect is the best gift of nature or god to this divine gift and endowment there is nothing so inimical as pleasure for when appetite is our master there is no place for self control nor where pleasure reigns supreme can virtue hold its ground to see this more vividly imagine a man excited to the highest conceivable pitch of sensual pleasure it can be doubtful to no one that such a person so long as he is under the influence of such excitation of the senses will be unable to use to any purpose either intellect reason or thought therefore nothing can be so execrable and so fatal as pleasure since when more than ordinarily violent and lasting it darkens all the light of the soul
4330508 i was only too glad to escape from that as though from a boorish and insane master
4330509 when that most gallant lacedaemonian lysander came to visit the persian prince cyrus at sardis so eminent for his character and the glory of his rule bringing him presents from his allies he treated lysander in all ways with courteous familiarity and kindness and among other things took him to see a certain park carefully planted
4330510 very many classes agree in deeming this to have been the very first man of the nation
4330511 the athenians know what is right but will not do it
4330512 do not suppose my dearest sons that when i have left you i shall be nowhere and no one even when i was with you you did not see my soul but knew that it was in this body of mine from what i did believe then that it is still the same even though you see it not the honours paid to illustrious men had not continued to exist after their death had the souls of these very men not done something to make us retain our recollection of them beyond the ordinary time for myself i never could be persuaded that soul while in mortal bodies were alive and died directly they left them nor in fact that the soul only lost all intelligence when it left the unintelligent body i believe rather that when by being liberated from all corporeal admixture it has begun to be pure and undefiled it is then that it becomes wise and again when mans natural frame is resolved into its elements by death it is clearly seen whither each of the other elements departs for they all go to the place from which they came but the soul alone is invisible alike when present and when departing once more you see that nothing is so like death as sleep and yet it is in sleepers that souls most clearly reveal their divine nature for they foresee many events when they are allowed to escape and are left free this shows what they are likely to be when they have completely freed themselves from the fetters of the body wherefore if these things are so obey me as a god but if my soul is to perish with my body nevertheless do you from awe of the gods who guard and govern this fair universe preserve my memory by the loyalty and piety of your lives
4330513 true friendship can only subsist between those who are animated by the strictest principles of honour and virtue
4330514 a perfect conformity of opinions upon all religious and civil subjects united with the highest degree of mutual esteem and affection
4330515 that no degree of friendship can either justify or excuse the commission of a criminal action
4330516 if any overtures of that nature had ever been made they would certainly have been rejected and consequently must have been concealed from public notice
4330517 never either to make or to grant a request which honour and virtue will not justify
4330518 never to require from a friend what he cannot grant without a breach of his honour and always to be ready to assist him upon every occasion consistent with that principle
4330519 to be ever ready to offer their advice with an unreserved and honest frankness of heart
4330520 to live exempt from cares is an essential ingredient to constitute human happiness but an ingredient however which he who voluntarily distresses himself with cares in which he has no necessary and personal interest must never hope to possess
4330521 friendship is an affair of self interest entirely and that the proper motive for engaging in it is not in order to gratify the kind and benevolent affections but for the benefit of that assistance and support which is to be derived from the connection
4330522 utility is the first and prevailing motive which induces mankind to enter into particular friendships
4330523 although friendship is certainly productive of utility yet utility is not the primary motive of friendship
4330524 his misfortunes had taught him to discern his real from his pretended friends as it was now no longer in his power to make either of them any returns
4330525 that in all important occurrences we should act towards our friend precisely in the same manner as if the case were our own
4330526 that our good offices should be exactly dealt out both in degree and value by the measure and merit of those we receive from him
4330527 that our conduct in relation to all his concerns should be governed by the same kind of sentiments with which he appears to be actuated in respect to them himself
4330528 so to regulate your affection towards your friend as to remember that the time may possibly come when you shall have reason to hate him
4330529 is the pleasure of acquiring a new friend supposing him endued with virtues which render him deserving our choice preferable to the satisfaction of possessing an old one
4330530 one must eat many a peck of salt with a man before he can have sufficient opportunities to approve himself a thorough friend
4330531 he who has the advantage should never appear sensible of his superiority
4330532 in a commerce of friendship mutual requests or concessions should neither be made nor granted without due and mature deliberation
4330533 the bands of friendship should be gradually untied rather than suddenly cut asunder
4330534 not to enter into them with those who are unworthy of the connection
4330535 we should never suffer affection to take root in our hearts before judgement has time to interpose
4330536 that were a man to be carried up into heaven and the beauties of universal nature displayed to his view he would receive but little pleasure from the wonderful scene if there were none to whom he might relate the glories he had beheld
4330537 some men were more obliged to their inveterate enemies than to their complaisant friends as they frequently heard the truth from the one but never from the other
4330538 never was old dotard on the stage so finely played upon as i have been by you to day
4330539 gonna have you naked by the end of this song
4330540 we cant be too optimistic about next years economic development a lot of unstable factors have emerged in the global markets
4330541 it will not be surprising if income from some sectors such as the gaming industry records negative growth next year as it had grown at a high speed in the past
4330542 fellow soldiers do not marvel that i am sorely distressed on account of the present troubles cyrus has been no ordinary friend to me when i was in banishment he honoured me in various ways and made me also a present of ten thousand darics these i accepted but not to lay them up for myself for private use not to squander them in pleasure but to expend them on yourselves and first of all i went to war with the thracians and with you to aid i wreaked vengeance on them in behalf of hellas driving them out of the chersonese when they wanted to deprive its hellenic inhabitants of their lands but as soon as cyrus summoned me i took you with me and set out so that if my benefactor had any need of me i might requite him for the good treatment i myself had received at his hands but since you are not minded to continue the march with me one of two things is left to 5 me to do either i must renounce you for the sake of my friendship with cyrus or i must go with you at the cost of deceiving him whether i am about to do right or not i cannot say but i choose yourselves and whatever betide i mean to share your fate never shall it be said of me by any one that having led greek troops against the barbarians 1 i betrayed the hellenes and chose the friendship of the barbarian no since you do not choose to obey and follow me i will follow after you whatever betide i will share your fate i look upon you as my country my friends my allies with you i think i shall be honoured wherever i be without you i do not see how i can help a friend or hurt a foe my decision is taken wherever you go i go also
4330543 fellow soldiers it is clear that the relations of cyrus to us are identical with ours to him we are no longer his soldiers since we have ceased to follow him and he on his side is no longer our paymaster he however no doubt considers himself wronged by us and though he goes on sending for me i cannot bring myself to go to him for two reasons chiefly from a sense of shame for i am forced to admit to myself that i have altogether deceived him but partly too because i am afraid of his seizing me and inflicting a penalty on the wrongs which he conceives 11 that i have done him in my opinion then this is no time for us to go to sleep and forget all about ourselves rather it is high time to deliberate on our next move and as long as we do remain here we had better bethink us how we are to abide in security or if we are resolved to turn our backs at once what will be the safest means of retreat and further how we are to procure supplies for without supplies there is no profit whatsoever in the general or the private soldier the man with whom we have to deal is an excellent friend to his friends but a very dangerous enemy to his foes and he is backed by a force of infantry and cavalry and ships such as we all alike very well see and know since we can hardly be said to have posted ourselves at any great distance from him if then any one has a suggestion to make now is the time to speak
4330544 go to cyrus and ask for some ships in order to return by sea if he refused to give them ships let them demand of him a guide to lead them back through a friendly district and if he would not so much as give them a guide they could but put themselves without more ado in marching order and send on a detachment to occupy the pass before cyrus and the cilicians whose property
4330545 as to my acting personally as general at this season pray do not propose it i can see numerous obstacles to my doing so obedience in the fullest i can render to the man of 15 your choice that is another matter and you shall see and know that i can play my part under command with the best of you
4330546 what a simple minded notion it is to beg a guide of the very man whose designs we are marring if we can trust any guide whom cyrus may vouchsafe to us why not order cyrus at once to occupy the pass on our behoof for my part i should think twice before i set foot on any ships that he might give us for fear lest he should sink them with his men of war and i should equally hesitate to follow any guide of his he might lead us into some place out of which we should find it impossible to escape i should much prefer if i am to return home against the will of cyrus at all to give him the slip and so begone which indeed is impossible but these schemes are simply nonsensical my proposal is that a deputation of fit persons with clearchus should go to cyrus let them go to cyrus and ask him what use he proposes to make of us and if the business is at all similar to that on which he once before employed a body of foreigners let us by all means follow let us show that we are the equals of those who accompanied him on his much up formerly but if the design should turn out to be of larger import than the former one involving more toil and more danger we should ask him either to give us good reasons for following his lead or else consent to send us away into a friendly country in this way whether we follow him we shall do so as friends and with heart and soul or whether we go back we shall do so in security the answer to this shall be reported to us here and when we have heard it we will advise as to our best course
4330547 have taken leave of us but they need not flatter themselves that in so doing they have stolen into hiding i know where they are gone nor will they owe their escape to speed i have men of war to capture their craft if i like but heaven help me if i mean to pursue them never shall it be said of me that i turn people to account as long as they stay with me but as soon as they are minded to be off i seize and maltreat them and strip them of their wealth not so let them go with the consciousness that our behaviour to them is better than theirs to us and yet i have their children and wives safe under lock and key in tralles but they shall not be deprived even of these they shall receive them back in return for their former goodness to me
4330548 if you will listen to me there is a method by which without risk or toil you may win the special favour of cyrus beyond the rest of the soldiers
4330549 why i have been informed by a credible person who went up to the king at susa that he passed through a large tract of excellent land extending for nearly a days journey which the people of the country called the queens girdle and another which they called her veil
4330550 soldiers accept my thanks at present eventually you shall thank me i will see to that or my name is not cyrus
4330551 clearchus proxenus and you other hellenes yonder you know not what you do as surely as you come to blows with one another our fate is sealed this very day i shall be cut to pieces and so will you your turn will follow close on mine let our fortunes once take an evil turn and these barbarians whom you see around will be worse foes to us than those who are at present serving the king
4330552 i have invited you hither my friends that i may take advice with you and carry out whatever in the sight of god and man it is right for me to do as concerning the man before you orontas the 6 prisoner was in the first instance given to me by my father to be my faithful subject in the next place acting to use his own words under the orders of my brother and having hold of the acropolis of sardis he went to war with me i met war with war and forced him to think it more prudent to desist from war with me whereupon we shook hands exchanging solemn pledges after that
4330553 then later on having received as you admit no injury from me did you revolt to the mysians and injure my territory as far as in you lay
4330554 then once more having discovered the limits of your power did you flee to the altar of artemis crying out that you repented and did you thus work upon my feelings that we a second time shook hands and made interchange of solemn pledges are these things so
4330555 that now for the third time you have been detected in a treasonous plot against me
4330556 but the day may come may it not when you will once again be hostile to my brother and a faithful friend to myself
4330557 even if i were you could never be brought to believe it cyrus
4330558 such has been the conduct of the prisoner in the past such is his language now i now call upon you and you first clearchus to declare your opinion what think you
4330559 my advice to you is to put this man out of the way as soon as may be so that we may be saved the necessity of watching him and have more leisure as far as he is concerned to requite the services of those whose friendship is sincere
4330560 it is certainly not from dearth of barbarians to fight my battles that i put myself at your head as my allies but because i hold you to be better and stronger than many barbarians that is why i took you see then that you prove yourselves to be men worthy of the liberty which you possess and which i envy you liberty it is a thing which be well assured i would choose in preference to all my other possessions multiplied many times but i would like you to know into what sort of struggle you are going learn its nature from one who knows their numbers are great and they come on with much noise but if you can hold out against these two things i confess i am ashamed to think what a sorry set of folk you will 4 find the inhabitants of this land to be but you are men and brave you must be being men it is agreed then if you wish to return home any of you i undertake to send you back in such sort that your friends at home shall envy you but i flatter myself i shall persuade many of you to accept what i will offer you here in lieu of what you left at home
4330561 ay cyrus but some say you can afford to make large promises now because you are in the crisis of impending danger but let matters go well with you will you recollect they shake their heads indeed some add that even if you did recollect and were ever so willing you would not be able to make good all your promises and repay
4330562 you forget sirs my fathers empire stretches southwards to a region where men cannot dwell by reason of the heat and northwards to a region uninhabitable through cold but all the intervening space is mapped out in satrapies belonging to my brothers friends so that if the victory be ours it will be ours also to put our friends in possession in their room on the whole my fear is not that i may not have enough to give to each of my friends but lest i may not have friends enough on whom to bestow what i have to give and to each of you hellenes i will give a crown of gold
4330563 but do you think that your brother will give battle 9 to you cyrus
4330564 not without a battle be assured shall the prize be won if he be the son of darius and parysatis and a brother of mine
4330565 well then if he does not fight within that time he will not fight at all and if your prophecy comes true i promise you ten talents
4330566 the king is advancing with a large army ready for battle
4330567 to expose oneself to the risks of war bareheaded is it is said a practice common to the persians
4330568 ctesias the son of ctesiochus was a physician of cnidos seventeen years of his life were passed at the court of persia fourteen in the service of darios three in that of artaxerxes he returned to greece in 398 b c
4330569 god grant i may live along enough to recompense my friends and requite my foes with a strong arm
4330570 how am i to deck myself out in all these to my mind a mans chief ornament is the adornment of nobly adorned friends
4330571 cyrus says this is the best wine he has tasted for a long time that is his excuse for sending it to you he hopes you will drink it up to day with a choice party of friends
4330572 this is cyruss favourite dish he hopes you will taste it yourself
4330573 would that cyrus were yet alive but since he is dead take back this answer to ariaeus that we at any rate have conquered the king and as you yourselves may see there is not a man left in the field to meet us indeed had you not arrived we should ere this have begun our march upon the king now we can promise to ariaeus that if he will join us here we will place him on the kings throne surely to those who conquer empire pertains
4330574 the great king having won the victory and slain cyrus bids the hellenes to surrender their arms to betake themselves to the gates of the kings palace and there obtain for themselves what terms they can
4330575 conquerors do not as a rule give up their arms
4330576 i leave it to you my fellow generals to make the best and noblest answer that ye may to these gentlemen i will rejoin you presently
4330577 for my part i marvel if the king demands our arms as our master or for the sake of friendship merely as presents if as our master why need he ask for them rather than come and take them but if he would fain wheedle us out of them by fine speeches he should tell us what the soldiers will receive in turn for such kindness
4330578 the king claims to have conquered because he has put cyrus to death and who is there now to claim the kingdom as against himself he further flatters himself that you also are in his power since he holds you in the heart of his country hemmed in by impassable rivers and he can at any moment bring against you a multitude so vast that even if leave were given to rise and slay you could not kill them
4330579 at this instant as you yourself can see we have nothing left but our arms and our valour if we keep the former we imagine we can make use of the latter but if we deliver up our arms we shall presently be robbed of our lives do not suppose then that we are going to give up to you the only good things which we possess we prefer to keep them and by their help we will do battle with you for the good things which are yours
4330580 spoken like a philosopher my fine young man and very pretty reasoning too yet let me tell you your wits are somewhat scattered if you imagine that your valour will get the better of the kings power
4330581 they had proved good and trusty friends to cyrus and the king might find them no less valuable if he liked to be friends with them he might turn them to any use that pleased his fancy say for a campaign against egypt their arms were at his service they would help to lay that country at his feet
4330582 as for your friends here one says one thing and one another will you please give us your opinion
4330583 the sight of you phalinus caused me much pleasure and not only me but all of us i feel sure for you are a hellene even as we are every one of us whom you see before you in our present plight we would like to take you into our counsel as to what we had better do touching your proposals i beg you then solemnly in the sight of heaven do you tender us such advice as you shall deem best and worthiest and such as shall bring you honour of after time when it will be said of you how once on a time phalinus was sent by the great king to bid certain hellenes yield up their arms and when they had taken him into their counsel he gave them such and such advice you know that whatever advice you do give us cannot fail to be reported in hellas
4330584 i say that if you have one chance one hope in ten thousand to wage a war with the king successfully do not give up your arms that is my advice if however you have no chance of escape without the kings consent then i say save yourselves in the only way you can
4330585 so then that is your 20 deliberate view well this is our answer take it back we conceive that in either case whether we are expected to be friends with the king we shall be worth more as friends if we keep our arms than if we yield them to another or whether we are to go to war we shall fight better with them than without
4330586 that answer we will repeat but the king bade me tell you this besides whilst you remain here there is truce but one step forward or one step back the truce ends there is war will you then please inform us as to that point also are you minded to stop and keep truce or is there to be war what answer shall i take from you
4330587 pray answer that we hold precisely the same views on this point as the king
4330588 as long as we stay here there is truce but a step forward or a step backward the truce ends there is war
4330589 truce if we stop but if we move forwards or backwards war
4330590 there are many persians he says better than himself who will not suffer him to sit upon the kings throne but if you are minded to go back with him you must join him this very night otherwise he will set off himself to morrow on the homeward route
4330591 it had best stand thus between us then if we come well and good be it as you propose but if we do not come do whatsoever you think most conducive to your interests
4330592 sirs i sacrificed and found the victims unfavourable to an advance against the king after all it is not so surprising perhaps for as i now learn between us and the king flows the river tigris navigable for big 3 vessels and we could not possibly cross it without boats and boats we have none on the other hand to stop here is out of the question for there is no possibility of getting provisions however the victims were quite agreeable to us joining the friends of cyrus this is what we must do then let each go away and sup on whatever he has at the first sound of the bugle to turn in get kit and baggage together at the second signal place them on the baggage animals and at the third fall in and follow the lead with the baggage animals on the inside protected by the river and the troops outside
4330593 the total distance of the route taking ephesus in ionia as the starting point up to the field of battle consisted of 93 stages 535 parasangs or 16 050 furlongs from the battle field to babylon reckoned a three days journey would have been another 360 stades
4330594 since you and we have one expedition in prospect will you 10 tell us what you think about the route shall we return the way we came or have you devised a better
4330595 to return the same way is to perish to a man by hunger for at this moment we have no provisions whatsoever during the seventeen last stages even on our way hither we could extract nothing from the country or if there was now and again anything we passed over and utterly consumed it at this time our project is to take another and a longer journey certainly but we shall not be in straits for provisions the earliest stages must be very long as long as we can make them the object is to put as large a space as possible between us and the royal army once we are two or three days journey off the danger is over the king will never overtake us with a small army he will not dare to dog our heels and with a vast equipment he will lack the power to march quickly perhaps he too may even find a scarcity of provisions there
4330596 you asked for my opinion see i have given it
4330597 whoever will give any information as to who let an ass into the camp shall receive a talent of silver in reward
4330598 take back word then to your master that we need a battle first for we have had no breakfast and he will be a brave man who will dare mention the word truce to hellenes without providing them with breakfast
4330599 the message seemed reasonable to the king they had now come bringing guides who if a truce were arranged would conduct them where they would get provisions
4330600 whether the truce was offered to the individual men merely as they went and came or to all alike
4330601 i agree to the resolution still i do not propose to announce it at once but to wile away time till the ambassadors begin to fear that we have decided against the truce though i suspect
4330602 the same fear will be operative on the minds of our soldiers also
4330603 men of hellas i am your next door neighbour in hellas therefore was it that i when i saw into what a sea of troubles you were fallen regarded it as a godsend if by any means i might obtain as a boon from the king the privilege of bringing you back in safety to your own country and that i take it will earn me gratitude from you and all hellas in this determination i preferred my request to the king i claimed it as a favour which was fairly my due for was it not i who first announced to him the hostile approach of cyrus who supported that announcement by the aid i brought who alone among the officers confronted with the hellenes in battle did not flee but charged right through and united my troops with the king inside your camp where he was arrived having slain cyrus it was i lastly who gave chase to the barbarians under cyrus with the help of those here present with me at this moment which are also among the trustiest followers of our lord the king now i counsel you to give a moderate answer so that it may be easier for me to carry out my design if haply i may obtain from him some good thing on your behalf
4330604 we neither mustered as a body to make war against the king nor was our march conducted with that object but it was cyrus as you know who invented many and divers pretexts that he might take you off your guard and transport us hither yet after a while when we saw that he was in sore straits we were ashamed in the sight of god and man to betray him whom we had permitted for so long a season to benefit us but now that cyrus is dead we set up no claim to his kingdom against the king himself there is neither person nor thing for the sake of which we would care 23 to injure the kings country we would not choose to kill him if we could rather we would march straight home if we were not molested but god helping us we will retaliate on all who injure us on the other hand if any be found to benefit us we do not mean to be outdone in kindly deeds as far as in us lies
4330605 that answer will i take back to the king and bring you word from him again until i come again let the truce continue and we will furnish you with a market
4330606 you may now if you like take pledges from us that we will make the countries through which you pass friendly to you and will lead you back without treachery into hellas and will furnish you with a market and wherever you cannot purchase we will permit you to take provisions from the district you on your side must swear that you will march as through a friendly country without damage merely taking food and drink wherever we fail to supply a market or if we afford a market you shall only obtain provisions by paying for them
4330607 and now i go back to the king as soon as i have transacted what i have a mind to i will come back ready equipped to lead you away to hellas and to return myself to my own dominion
4330608 that the king would give a great deal to destroy us so that other hellenes may take warning and think twice before they march against the king to day it suits his purpose to induce us to stop here because his army is scattered but as soon as he has got together another armament attack us most certainly he will how do we know he is not at this moment digging away at trenches or running up walls to make our path impassable it is not to be supposed that he will desire us to return to hellas with a tale how a handful of men like ourselves beat the king at his own gates laughed him to scorn and then came home again
4330609 i too am keenly aware of all this but i reason thus if we turn our backs now they will say we mean war and are acting contrary to the truce and then what follows first of all no one will furnish us with a market or means of providing ourselves with food next we shall have no one to guide us moreover such action on our part will be a signal to ariaeus to hold aloof from us so that not a friend will be left to us even those who were formerly our friends will now be numbered with our enemies what other river or rivers we may find we have to cross i do not know but this we know to cross the euphrates in face of resistance is impossible you see in the event of being driven to an engagement we have no cavalry to help us but with the enemy it is the reverse not only the most but the best of his troops are cavalry so that if we are victorious we shall kill no one but if we are defeated not a man of us can escape for my part i cannot see why the king who has so many advantages on his side if 7 he desires to destroy us should swear oaths and tender solemn pledges merely in order to perjure himself in the sight of heaven to render his word worthless and his credit discreditable the wide world over
4330610 i have been sent by ariaeus and artaozus who have been trusty friends to cyrus in past days and are your well wishers they warn you to be on your guard in case the barbarians attack you in the night there is a large body of troops in the neighbouring park they also warn you to send and occupy the bridge over the tigris since tissaphernes is minded to break it down in the night if he can so that you may not cross but be caught between the river and the canal
4330611 we should not be any the more able to save ourselves by flight there would be no place to flee to but in the opposite case suppose we win with the bridge broken down it is they who will not be able to save themselves by flight and what is worse for them not a single soul will be able to bring them succour from the other side for all their numbers since the bridge will be broken down
4330612 how large the country between the tigris and the canal might be
4330613 and in it are villages and cities numerous and large
4330614 i do not forget that oaths have been exchanged between us and right hands shaken in token that we will abstain from mutual injury but i can see that you watch us narrowly as if we were foes and we seeing this watch you narrowly in return
4330615 i coveted the friendship of cyrus i believed him to be abler than any man of his day to benefit those whom he chose but to day i look and behold it is you who are in his place the power which belonged 11 to cyrus and his territory are yours now you have them and your own satrapy besides safe and sound while the kings power which was a thorn in the side of cyrus is your support this being so it would be madness not to wish to be your friend but i will go further and state to you the reasons of my confidence that you on your side will desire our friendship i know that the mysians are a cause of trouble to you and i flatter myself that with my present force i could render them humbly obedient to you this applies to the pisidians also and i am told there are many other such tribes besides i think i can deal with them all they shall cease from being a constant distubance to your peace and prosperity then there are the egyptians 2 i know your anger against them to day is very great nor can i see what better force you will find to help you in chastising them than this which marches at my back to day again if you seek the friendship of any of your neighbours round there shall be no friend so great as you if any one annoys you with us as your faithful servitors you shall belord it over him and such service we will render you not as hirelings merely for pays sake but for the gratitude which we shall rightly feel to you to whom we owe our lives as i dwell on these matters i confess the idea of your feeling mistrust of us is so astonishing that i would give much to discover the name of the man who is so clever of speech that he can persuade you that we harbour designs against you
4330616 i am glad clearchus to listen to your sensible remarks for with the sentiments you hold if you were to devise any mischief against me it could only be out of malevolence to yourself
4330617 and if at all these points we were worsted yet fire as they say is stronger than the fruit of the field we can burn it down and call up famine in arms against you against which you for all your bravery will never be able to contend
4330618 why when we had it in our power to destroy you did we not proceed to do it know well that the cause of this was nothing less than my passion to prove myself faithful to the hellenes and that as cyrus went up relying on a foreign force attracted by payment i in turn might go down strong in the same through service rendered various ways in which you hellenes may be useful to me you yourself have mentioned but there is one still greater it is the great kings privilege alone to wear the tiara upright upon his head yet in your presence it may be given to another mortal to wear it upright here upon his heart
4330619 then are not those worthy of the worst 24 penalties who in spite of all that exists to cement our friendship endeavour by slander to make us enemies
4330620 and if your generals and captains care to come in some open and public way i will name to you those who tell me that you are plotting against me and the army under me
4330621 i will bring all and i will show you on my side the source from which i derive my information concerning you
4330622 hellenes clearchus being shown to have committed perjury and to have broken the truce has suffered the penalty and he is dead but proxenus and menon in return for having given information of his treachery are in high esteem and honour as to yourselves the king demands your arms he claims them as his since they belonged to cyrus who was his slave
4330623 thou villain ariaeus and you the rest of you who were cyruss friends have you no shame before god or man first to swear to us that you have the same friends and the same enemies as we ourselves and then to turn and betray us making common cause with tissaphernes that most impious and villainous of men with him you have murdered the very men to whom you gave your solemn word and oath and to the rest of us turned traitors and having so done 39 you join hand with our enemies to come against us
4330624 there is no doubt but that clearchus has been known for some time to harbour designs agaisnt tissaphernes and orontas and all of us who side with them
4330625 well then granting that clearchus broke the truce contrary to our oaths he has his deserts for perjurers deserve to perish but where are proxenus and menon our generals and your good friends and benefactors as you admit send them back to us surely just because they are friends of both parites they will try to give us the best advice for you and for us
4330626 he is a thessalian alcibiades rich and luxurious a spoilt child of fortune
4330627 i consider to be worth my fatherland and more to me
4330628 it is in true homeric vein and in something like homeric language that xenophon to whom we owe the whole narrative of the expedition describes his dream or the intervention of oneiros sent by zeus from which this renovating impulse took its rise
4330629 you did so put the question you should do what the god enjoined
4330630 sleep sirs i cannot nor can you i fancy nor lie here longer when i see in what straits we are our enemy we may be sure did not open war upon us till he felt he had everything amply ready yet none of us shows a corresponding anxiety to enter the lists of battle in the bravest style
4330631 and yet if we yield ourselves and fall into the kings power need we ask what our fate will be
4330632 for my part all the while the truce lasted i never ceased pitying ourselves and congratulating the king and those with him as like a helpless spectator i surveyed the extent and quality of their territory the plenteousness of their provisions the multitude of their dependants their cattle their gold and their apparel
4330633 now however that they have abruptly ended the truce there is an end also to their own insolence and to our suspicion
4330634 howbeit for i doubt not elsewhere similar reflections are being made whatsoever betide let us not in heavens name wait for others to come and challenge us to noble deeds let us rather take the lead in stimulating the rest to valour show yourselves to be the bravest of officers and among generals the worthiest to command for myself if you choose to start forwards on this quest i will follow or if you bid me lead you my age shall be no excuse to stand between me and your orders at least i am of full age i take it to avert misfortune from my own head
4330635 o most marvellous of men though you have eyes to see you do not perceive though you have ears to hear you do not recollect you were present 27 with the rest of us now here when after the death of cyrus the king vaunting himself on that occurrence sent dictatorially to bid us lay down our arms but when we instead of giving up our arms put them on and went and pitched our camp near him his manner changed it is hard to say what he did not do he was so at his wits end sending us embassies and begging for a truce and furnishing provisions the while until he had got it or to take the contrary instance when just now acting precisely on your principles our generals and captains went trusting to the truce unarmed to a conference with them what came of it what is happening at this instant beaten goaded with pricks insulted poor souls they cannot even die though death i ween would be very sweet and you who know all this how can you say that it is mere nonsense to talk of self defence how can you bid us go again and try the arts of persuasion in my opinion sirs we ought not to admit this fellow to the same rank with ourselves rather ought we to deprive him of his captaincy and load him with packs and treat him as such the man is a disgrace to his own fatherland and the whole of hellas that being a hellene he is what he is
4330636 nay this fellow has no connection either with boeotia or with hellas none whatever i have noted both his ears bored like a lydians
4330637 generals and captains it seemed right to us in view of the present crisis ourselves to assemble and to summon you that we might advise upon some practicable course would you xenophon repeat what you said to us
4330638 we all know only too well that 34 the king and tissaphernes have seized as many of us as they could and it is clear they are plotting to destroy the rest of us if they can
4330639 at this very moment you would confer a great boon on the army if you made it your business to appoint generals and officers to fill the places of those that are lost for without leaders nothing good or noble to put it concisely was ever wrought anywhere and in military matters this is absolutely true for if discipline is held to be of saving virtue the want of it has been the ruin of many ere now well then when you have appointed all the commanders necessary it would only be opportune i take it if you were to summon the rest of the soldiers and speak some words of encouragement even now i daresay you noticed yourselves the crestfallen air with which they came into camp the despondency with which they fell to picket duty so that unless there is a change for the better i do not know for what service they will be fit whether by night if need were or even by day the thing is to get them to turn their thoughts to what they mean to do instead of to what they are likely to suffer do that and their spirits will soon revive wonderfully you know i need hardly remind you it is not numbers or strength that gives victory in war but heaven helping them to one or other of two combatants it is 42 given to dash with stouter hearts to meet the foe and such onset in nine cases out of ten those others refuse to meet this observation also i have laid to heart that they who in matters of war seek in all ways to save their lives are just they who as a rule die dishonourably whereas they who recognising that death is the common lot and destiny of all men strive hard to die nobly these more frequently as i observe do after all attain to old age or at any rate while life lasts they spend their days more happily this lesson let all lay to heart this day for we are just at such a crisis of our fate now is the season to be brave ourselves and to stimulate the rest by our example
4330640 xenophon hitherto i knew only so much of you as that you were i heard an athenian but now i must commend you for your words and for your conduct i hope that there may be many more like you for it would prove a public blessing
4330641 let us waste no time retire at once i beg you and choose leaders where you need them after you have made your elections come back to the middle of the camp and bring the newly appointed officers after that we will there summon a general meeting of the soldiers let tolmides the herald
4330642 fellow soldiers the present posture of affairs is not pleasant seeing that we are robbed of so many generals and captains and soldiers and more than that our 2 former allies ariaeus and his men have betrayed us still we must rise above our circumstances to prove ourselves brave men and not give in but try to save ourselves by glorious victory if we can or if not at least to die gloriously and never while we have breath in our bodies fall into the hands of our enemies in which latter case i fear we shall suffer things which i pray the gods may visit rather upon those we hate
4330643 you see men the perjury and the impiety of the king you see the faithlessness of tissaphernes professing that he was next door neighbour to hellas and would give a good deal to save us in confirmation of which he took an oath to us himself he gave us the pledge of his right hand and then with a lie upon his lips this same man turned round and arrested our generals he had no reverence even for zeus the god of strangers but after entertaining clearchus at his own board as a friend he used his hospitality to delude and decoy his victims and ariaeus whom we offered to make king with whom we exchanged pledges not to betray each other even this man without a particle of fear of the gods or respect for cyrus in his grave though he was most honoured by cyrus in lifetime even he has turned aside to the worst foes of cyrus and is doing his best to injure the dead mans friends them may the gods requite as they deserve but we with these things before our eyes will not any more be cheated and cajoled by them we will make the best fight we can and having made it whatever the gods think fit to send we will accept
4330644 if the gods grant victory the finest attire will match with victory best or if i must needs die then for one who has aspired to the noblest it is well there should be some outward correspondence between his expectation and his end
4330645 cleanor has spoken of the perjury and 8 faithlessness of the barbarians and you yourselves know them only too well i fancy if then we are minded to enter a second time into terms of friendship with them with the experience of what our generals who in all confidence entrusted themselves to their power have suffered reason would we should feel deep despondency if on the other hand we purpose to take our good swords in our hands and to inflict punishment on them for what they have done and from this time forward will be on terms of downright war with them then god helping we have many a bright hope of safety
4330646 i propose sirs since even as we spoke of safety an omen from zeus the saviour has appeared we vow a vow to sacrifice to the saviour thank offerings for safe deliverance wheresoever first we reach a friendly country and let us couple with that vow another of individual assent that we will offer to the rest of the gods according to our ability let all those who are in favour of this proposal hold up their hands
4330647 i was saying that many and bright are the hopes we have of safety
4330648 even as she spake and telemachus sneezed loudly and around the roof rung wondrously and penelope laughed
4330649 dost thou not mark how my son has sneezed a blessing on all my words
4330650 heredotus estimates the number of those who fell on the persian side at 6400 men the number of athenian dead is accurately known since all were collected for the last solemn obsequies they were 192
4330651 and proofs of these things are yet to be seen in trophies but the greatest witness of all is the freedom of our cities the liberty of that land in which you were born and bred
4330652 nor let any one suppose that herein is a point of weakness in that cyruss troops who before were drawn up by your side have now deserted us for they are even worse cowards still than those we worsted
4330653 may be however you are in good heart about the fighting but annoyed to think that tissaphernes will not guide us any more and that the king will not furnish us with a market any longer
4330654 or again perhaps you admit tht our present position is not without its advantages but you feel sure that the rivers are a difficulty and think that you were never more taken in than when you crossed 22 them if so consider whether after all this is not perhaps the most foolish thing which the barbarians have done
4330655 it seems to me that it is only right in the first instance to make an effort to return to hellas and to revisit our hearths and homes if only to prove to other hellenes that it is their own faults if they are poor and needy 6 seeing it is in their power to give to those 26 now living a pauper life at home a free passage hither and convert them into well to do burghers at once
4330656 let us look another matter in the face how are we to march most safely or where blows are needed how are we to fight to the best advantage that is the question
4330657 the first thing which i recommend is to burn the wagons we have got so that we may be free to march wherever the army needs and not practically make our baggage train our general
4330658 it only rests for me to name the one thing which i look upon as the greatest of all you see the enemy did not dare to bring war to bear upon us until they had first seized our generals they felt that whilst our rulers were there and we obeyed them they were no match for us in war but having got hold of them they fully expected that the consequent confusion and anarchy would prove fatal to us what follows this officers and leaders ought to be more vigilant ever than their predecessors subordinates still more orderly and obedient to those in command now than even they were to those who are gone and you should pass a resolution that in case of insubordination any one 31 who stands by is to aid the officer in chastising the offender so the enemy will be mightily deceived for on this day they will behold ten thousand clearchuses instead of one who will not suffer one man to play the coward and now it is high time i brought my remarks to an end for may be the enemy will be here anon let those who are in favour of these proposals confirm them with all speed that they may be realised in fact or if any other course seem better let not any one even though he be a private soldier shrink from proposing it our common safety is our common need
4330659 if there is anything else to be done beyond what xenophon has mentioned we shall be able to carry it out presently but with regard to what he has already proposed it seems to me the best course to vote upon the matters at once those who are in favour of xenophons proposals hold up their hands
4330660 listen sirs while i tell you what i think we have need of besides
4330661 if any one has any better plan we need not adopt mine but if not suppose cheirisophus takes the lead as he is a lacedaemonian and the two eldest generals take in charge the two wings respectively whilst timasion and i the two youngest will for the present guard the rear 37 for the rest we can but make experiment of this arrangement and alter it with deliberation as from time to time any improvement suggests itself if any one has a better plan to propose let him do so
4330662 those in favour of this resolution hold up their hands
4330663 it would be well to separate and carry out what we have decreed if any of you has set his heart on seeing his friends again let him remember to prove himself a man there is no other way to achieve his hearts wish or is mere living an object with any of you strive to conquer if to slay is the privilege of victory to die is the doom of the defeated or perhaps to gain money and wealth is your ambition strive again for mastery have not conquerors the double gain of keeping what is their own whilst they seize the possessions of the vanquished
4330664 men of hellas i have been faithful to cyrus as you know well and to day i am your well wisher indeed i am here spending my days in great fear if then i could see any salutory course in prospect i should be disposed to join you with all my retainers please inform me then as to what you propose regarding me as your friend and well wisher anxious only to pursue his march in your company
4330665 we have resolved to make our way through the country inflicting the least possible damage provided we are allowed a free passage homewards but if any one tries to hinder 3 us he will have to fight it out with us and we shall bring all the force in our power to bear
4330666 i was driven to pursue it was too trying to look on and see our men suffer so badly and be unable to retaliate however when we did charge there is no denying the truth of what you say we were not a whit more able to injure the enemy while we had considerable difficulty in beating a retreat ourselves thank heaven they did not come upon us in any great force but were only a handful of men so that the injury they did us was not large as it might have been and at least it has served to show us what we need at present the enemy shoot and sling beyond our range so that our cretan archers are no match for them our hand throwers cannot reach as far and when we pursue it is not possible to push the pursuit to any great distance from the main body and within the short distance no foot soldier however fleet of foot could overtake another foot soldier who has a bow shot the start of him if then we are to exclude them from all possibility of injuring us as we march we must get slingers as soon as possible and cavalry i am told there are in the army some rhodians most of whom they say know how to sling and their missile will reach even twice as far as the persian slings which on account of their being loaded with stones as big as ones fist have a comparatively short range but the rhodians are skilled in the use of leaden bullets 2 suppose then we investigate and 18 find out first of all who among them possess slings and for these slings offer the owner the money value and to another who will plait some more hand over the money price and for a third who will volunteer to be enrolled as a slinger invent some other sort of privilege i think we shall soon find people to come forward capable of helping us there are horses in the army i know some few with myself others belonging to clearchuss stud and a good many others captured from the enemy used for carrying baggage let us take the pick of these supplying their places by ordinary baggage animals and equipping the horses for cavalry i should not wonder if our troopers gave some annoyance to these fugitives
4330667 trained his archers to short compass who had been accustomed to the point blank
4330668 the reason is plain look yonder this crest which overhangs our descent has been occupied there is no passing 39 until we have dislodged these fellows why have you not brought up the light infantry
4330669 to decide how we are to dislodge these fellows from the crest
4330670 the best thing we can do cheirisophus is to make a dash at the height itself and with what speed we may
4330671 now for it brave sirs bethink you that this race is for hellas now or never to find your boys your wives one small effort and the rest of the march we shall pursue in peace without ever a blow to strike now for it
4330672 we are not on equal terms xenophon you are mounted 47 on a horse i can hardly get along with my shield to carry
4330673 and the men behind to pass him by as he could but ill keep up the pace
4330674 do you not see men of hellas they admit that the country is now ours what they stipulated against our doing when they made the treaty viz
4330675 but it strikes me we should sally forth against these incendiaries and protect our country
4330676 that is not quite my view i say let us do a little burning ourselves and they will cease all the quicker
4330677 i am ready sirs to carry you across four thousand heavy infantry at a time if you will furnish me with what i need and give me a talent into the bargain for my pains
4330678 two thousand wine skins i see there are plenty of sheep and goats and asses they have only to be flayed and their skins inflated and they will readily give us a passage i shall want also the straps which you use for the baggage animals with these i shall couple the skins to one another then i shall moor each skin by attaching stones and letting them down like anchors into the water then i shall carry them across and when i have fastened the links at both ends i shall place layers of wood on them and a coating of earth on the top of that you will see in a minute that theres no danger of your drowning for every skin will be able to support a couple of men without sinking and the wood and earth will prevent your slipping off
4330679 we were forced to fight and flee at the same 19 moment and now it has cost us the lives of two fine fellows they are dead and we were not able to pick up their bodies or bury them
4330680 do you see how inaccessible it all is only this one road which you see going straight up and on it all that crowd of men who have seized and are guarding the single exit that is why i hastened on and why i could not wait for you hoping to be beforehand with them yonder in seizing the pass the guides we have got say there is no other way
4330681 but i have got two prisoners also the enemy annoyed us so much that we laid an ambuscade for them which also gave us time to recover our breaths we killed some of them and did our best to catch one or two alive for this very reason that we might have guides who knew the country to depend upon
4330682 did they know of any other road than the one visible
4330683 yonder man said he did not know because he has got a daughter married to a husband in those parts i can take you
4330684 there 27 will be no lack of youngsters to follow where i lead
4330685 were there any captains of light infantry willing to accompany the expedition
4330686 to stick tight to them and not to be outdone
4330687 the infantry soldiers clamoured not to be left behind but to follow them up into the mountains
4330688 wait till you are within sling shot and the shield rattles then sound the paean and charge the enemy as soon as he turns and the bugle from the river sounds for the attack you will face about to the right the rear rank leading and the whole detachment falling back and crossing the river as quickly as possible every one preserving his original rank so as to avoid tramelling one another the bravest man is he who gets to the other side first
4330689 a persian and was going from the army of tiribazus to get provisions
4330690 how large the army was and for what object it had been collected
4330691 it consisted of tiribazus at the head of his own forces and aided by some chalybian and taochian mercenaries tiribazus had got it together
4330692 meaning to attack the hellenes on the high mountain pass in a defile which was the sole passage
4330693 they were on their way from the king to the satrap
4330694 the enemy as you see are in occupation of the mountain pass it is time we should consider how we are to make the best fight to win it my opinion is that we should give orders to the troops to take their morning meal whilst we deliberate whether we should cross the mountains to day or to morrow
4330695 is that as soon as we have breakfasted we should arm for the fight and attack the enemy without loss of time for if we fritter away to day the enemy who are now content to look at us will grow bolder and with their growing courage depend upon it others more numerous will join them
4330696 is how i see the matter if fight we must let us make preparation to sell our lives dearly but if we desire to cross with the greatest ease the point to consider is how we may get the fewest wounds and throw away the smallest number of good men
4330697 but what right have i to be drawing conclusions about stealing in your presence cheirisophus for you lacedaemonians as i have often been told you who belong to the peers practise stealing from your boyhood up and it is no disgrace but honourable rather to steal except such things as the law forbids and in order i presume to stimulate your sense of secretiveness and to make you master thieves it is lawful for you further to get a whipping if you are caught now then you have a fine opportunity of displaying your training but take care we are not caught stealing over the mountain or we shall catch it ourselves
4330698 i have heard that you athenians are clever hands at stealing the public moneys and that too though there is a fearful risk for the person so employed but i am told it is your best men who are addicted to it if it is your best men who are thought worthy to rule so it is a fine opportunity for yourself also xenophon to exhibit your education
4330699 am ready to take the rear division as soon as we have supped and seize the mountain chain i have already got guides for the light troops laid an ambuscade and seized some of the cut purse vagabonds who hung on our rear i am further informed by them that the mountain is not inaccessible but is grazed by goats and cattle so that if we can once get hold of any portion of it there will be no difficulty as regards our animals they can cross as to the enemy i expect they will not even wait for us any longer when they once see us on a level with themselves on the heights for they do not even at present care to come down and meet us on fair ground
4330700 but why should you go and leave your command in the rear send others rather unless a band of volunteers will present themselves
4330701 in the nick of time you have come we must take this place for the troops have no provisions unless we take it
4330702 there is just this one narrow approach which you see but when we attempt to pass it by they roll down volleys of stones from yonder overhanging crag
4330703 and this is the state in which you find yourself if you chance to be caught
4330704 there is nothing else is there to hinder our passing certainly except yonder handful of fellows there is no one in front of us that we can see and of them only two or three apparently are armed and the distance to be traversed under fire is as your eyes will tell you about one hundred and fifty feet as near as can be and of this space the first hundred is thickly covered with great pines at intervals under cover of these what harm can come to our men from a pelt of stones flying 6 or rolling so then there is only fifty feet left to cross during a lull of stones
4330705 but with our first attempt to approach the bush a galling fire of stones commences
4330706 for they will use up their ammunition all the quicker but let us select a point from which we shall have only a brief space to run across if we can and from which it will be easier to get back if we wish
4330707 if i fail of my word you are free to take my life
4330708 the ridge called tekieh dagh to the east of gumisch kana nearer to the sea than that place
4330709 that this must be my native country and if there is no objection i will have a talk with them
4330710 pray talk 5 to them and ask them first who they are
4330711 ask them why they are drawn up in battle and want to fight with us
4330712 if so it is with not intention certainly of doing it or you any harm but we have been at war with the king and are now returning to hellas and all we want is to reach the sea
4330713 were they willing to give them pledges to that effect
4330714 yes they were ready to give and receive pledges to that effect
4330715 i am not for advancing in line but advise to form companies by columns to begin with the line
4330716 would be scattered and thrown into disorder at once for we shall find the mountain full of inequalities it will be pathless here and easy to traverse there the mere fact of first having formed in line and then seeing the line thrown into disorder must exercise a disheartening effect again if we advance several deep the enemy will none the less overlap us and turn their superfluous numbers to account as best they like while if we march in shallow order we may fully expect our line to be cut through and through by the thick rain 11 of missiles and rush of men and if this happen anywhere along the line the whole line will equally suffer no my notion is to form columns by companies covering ground sufficient with spaces between the companies to allow the last companies of each flank to be outside the enemys flanks thus we shall with our extreme companies be outside the enemys line and the best men at the head of their columns will lead the attack and every company will pick its way where the ground is easy also it will be difficult for the enemy to force his way into the intervening spaces when there are companies on both sides nor will it be easy for him to cut in twain any individual company marching in column if too any particular company should be pressed the neighbouring company will come to the rescue or if at any point any single company succeed in reaching the height from that moment not one man of the enemy will stand his ground
4330717 these men whom you see in front of you are the sole obstacles still interposed between us and the haven of our hopes so long deferred we will swallow them up whole without cooking 2 if we can
4330718 the retreat of the ten thousand a military study for all time
4330719 perchance wert thou to enter within the gates and long walls and devour priam raw and priams sons and all the trojans then mightest thou assuage thine anger
4330720 modern travellers attest the existence in these regions of honey intoxicating and poisonous
4330721 to sacrifice to zeus the preserver and to heracles thank offerings for safe guidance
4330722 there this ridge is just the place for running anywhere everywhere
4330723 will they manage to wrestle on the hard scrubby ground
4330724 for my part sirs i am weary by this time of getting kit together and packing up for a start of walking and running and carrying heavy arms and of tramping along in line or mounting guard and doing battle the sole desire i now have is to cease from all these pains and for the future since here we have the sea before us to sail on and on stretched out in sleep like odysseus and so to find myself in hellas
4330725 i have a friend sirs who as good hap will have it is now high admiral anaxibius if you like to send me to him i think i can safely promise to return with some men of war and other vessels which will carry us all you have to do if you are really minded to go home by sea is to wait here till i come i will be back ere long
4330726 cheirisophus it is agreed sets out in search of vessels and we are going to await him let me tell you what in my opinion it is reasonable to do while we are waiting first of all we must provide ourselves with necessaries from hostile territory for there is not a sufficient market nor if there were have we with a few solitary exceptions the means of purchase now the district is hostile so that if you set off in search of provisions without care and precaution the chances are that many of us will be lost to meet this risk i propose that we should organise foraging parties to capture provisions and for the rest not roam about the country at random the organisation of the matter should be left to us
4330727 some of you no doubt will be going out to pillage it will be best i think that whoever does so should in each case before starting inform us of his intent and in what direction he means to go so that we may know the exact number of those who are out and of those who stop behind thus we shall be able to help in preparing and starting the expedition where necessary and in case of aid or reinforcements being called for we shall know in what direction to proceed or again if the attempt is to be undertaken by raw or less expert hands we may throw in the weight of our experience and advice by endeavouring to discover the strength of those whom they design to attack
4330728 to which i would draw your attention our enemies will not lack leisure to make raids upon us nor is it unnatural that they should lay plots for us for we have appropriated what is theirs they are seated over us ever on the watch i propose then that we should have regular outposts round the camp if we take it in succession to do picket and outlook duty the enemy will be less able to harry us and here is another point for your observation supposing we knew for certain that cheirisophus must return with a sufficient number of vessels there would be no need of 10 the remark but as that is still problematical i propose that we should try to get together vessels on the spot also if he comes and finds us already provided for here we shall have more ships than we need that is all while if he fails to bring them we shall have the local supply to fall back upon i see ships sailing past perpetually so we have only to ask the loan of some war ships from the men of trapezus and we can bring them into port and safeguard them with their rudders unshipped until we have enough to carry us by this course i think we shall not fail of finding the means of transport requisite
4330729 consider whether you think it equitable to support by means of a general fund the ships companies which we so impress while they wait here for our benefit and to agree upon a fare on the principle of repaying kindnesses in kind
4330730 in case after all our endeavours should not be crowned with success and we find that we have not vessels enough i propose that we should enjoin on the cities along the seaboard the duty of constructing and putting in order the roads which we hear are impassable they will be only too glad to obey no doubt out of mere terror and their desire to be rid of us
4330731 if you get your roads in good order we shall all the sooner be gone
4330732 there is a fastness choke full of all sorts of stores but we cannot take it it is too strong nor can we easily get away the enemy rush out and deliver battle and the return is difficult
4330733 musos mysus a mysian by birth and musos mysus by name
4330734 men of the mossynoecians our desire is to reach hellas in safety and since we have no vessels we must needs go by foot but these people who as we hear are your enemies prevent us will you take us for your allies now is your chance to exact vengeance for any wrong which they at any time may have put upon you and for the future they will be your subjects but if you send us about our business consider and ask yourselves from what quarter will you ever again obtain so strong a force to help you
4330735 but to what use do you propose to put us if we become your allies and what will you in turn be able to do to assist our passage
4330736 we can make an incursion into this country hostile to yourselves and us from the opposite side and also send 10 you ships and men to this place who will aid you in fighting and conduct you on the road
4330737 soldiers do not in any wise be cast down by what has happened be sure that good no less than evil will be the result for to begin with you now know certainly that those who are going to guide us are in very deed hostile to those with whom necessity drives us to quarrel and in the next place some of our own body these hellenes who have made so light of orderly array and conjoint action with ourselves as though they must needs achieve in the company of barbarians all they could with ourselves have paid the penalty and been taught a lesson so that another time they will be less prone to leave our ranks but you must be prepared to show these friendly barbarians that you are of a better sort and prove to the enemy that battle with the undisciplined is one thing but with men like yourselves another
4330738 up to this point the expedition was conducted on land and the distance traversed on foot from the battle field near babylon down to cotyora amounted to one hundred and twenty two stages that is to say six hundred and twenty parasangs or eighteen thousand stades or if measured in time an eight months march
4330739 the city of the sinopeans has sent us to offer you as hellenes our compliments and congratulations on your victories over the barbarians and next to express our joyful satisfaction that you have surmounted all those terrible sufferings of which we have heard and have reached this place in safety as hellenes we claim to receive at your hands as fellow hellenes kindness and not harm we have certainly not ourselves set you an example heretofore of evil treatment now the cotyorites are our colonists it was we who gave them this country to dwell in having 10 taken it from the barbarians for which reason also they with the men of cerasus and trapezus pay us an appointed tribute so that whatever mischief you inflict on the men of cotyora the city of sinope takes as personal to herself at the present time we hear that you have made forcible entry into their city some of you and are quartered in the houses besides taking forcibly from the cotyorite estates whatever you need by hook and by crook now against these things we enter protest if you mean to go on so doing you will drive us to make friends with corylas and the paphlagonians or any one else we can find
4330740 as to ourselves men of sinope having got so far we are well content to have saved our bodies and our arms
4330741 but wherever we come be it foreign or hellenic soil and find no market for provisions we are wont to help ourselves not out of insolence but from necessity
4330742 that we have got in by force and have taken up quarters this is what we did we requested them to receive our sick and wounded under cover and when they refused to open their gates we walked in where the place itself invited us all the violence we have committed amounts to this that our sick folk are quartered under cover paying for their expenses and we keep a sentry at the gates so that our sick and wounded may not lie at the mercy of your governor but we may have it in our power to remove them whenever we like the rest of us you observe are camping under the canopy of heaven in regular rank and file and we are ready to requite kindness with kindness but to repel evil vigorously and as for your threat
4330743 that you will if it suits you make alliance with corylas and the paphlagonians to attack us for our part we have no objection to fighting both sets of you if so be we must we have already fought others many times more numerous than you besides if it suits us as you put it to make the paphlagonian our friend report says that he has a hankering after your city and some other places on the seaboard we can enhance the value of our friendship by helping to win for him what he covets
4330744 we will welcome you there with gifts of hospitality meanwhile we will enjoin upon the citizens of this place to give you what they can for we can see that every word of what you say is true
4330745 to convey a threat as though they were minded to go to war with the hellenes but as meaning rather albeit we have it in our power to be friendly with the barbarians we will choose the hellenes
4330746 if i bestow upon you the best counsel i am able god grant that blessings in abundance may descend on me but if the contrary may evil betide 4 me
4330747 as to trouble i am quite aware we shall have much more trouble if you are conveyed by sea for we must provide the vessels whereas if you go by land all the fighting will evolve on you
4330748 but now supposing you were able to seize the mountain barrier by stealth or expedition before the enemy could stop you supposing further you were able to win an engagement in the plain against not only their cavalry but their more than one hundred and twenty thousand infantry you will only find yourself face to face with rivers a series of them first the thermodon three hundred feet broad which i take it will be difficult to pass especially with a host of foes in front and another following behind next comes the iris river three hundred feet broad and thirdly the halys at least two furlongs broad which you could not possibly cross without vessels and who is going to supply you with vessels in the same way too the parthenius 9 is impassable which you will reach if you cross the halys for my part then i consider the land journey i will not say difficult but absolutely impossible for you whereas if you go by sea you can coast along from here to sinope and from sinope to heraclea from heraclea onwards there is no difficulty whether by land or by sea for there are plenty of vessels at heraclea
4330749 sinopeans the army has chosen that method of procedure which you advise and thus the matter stands if there are sure to be vessels enough to make it impossible for a single man to be left behind go by sea we will but if part of us are to be left while part go by sea we will not set foot on board the vessels one fact we plainly recognise strength is everything to us so long as we have the mastery we shall be able to protect ourselves and get provisions but if we are once caught at the mercy of our foes it is plain we shall be reduced to slavery
4330750 do not set your thoughts on staying here let hellas and hellas only be the object of your affection for i am told that certain persons have been sacrificing on this very question without saying a word to you now i can promise you if you once leave these waters to furnish you with regular monthly pay dating from the first of the month at the rate of one cyzicene 2 a head per month i will bring you to the troad from which part i am an exile and my own state is at your service they will receive me with open arms i will be your guide personally and i will take you to plces where you will get plenty of money i know every corner of the aeolid and phrygia and the troad and indeed the whole satrapy of pharnabazus partly because it is my birthplace partly from campaigns in that region with clearchus and dercylidas 3
4330751 i no less than timasion can guarantee you regular pay
4330752 that xenophon should be privately persuading people to stop there and consulting the victims for that end without letting the army into the secret or breathing a syllable in public about the matter
4330753 sirs you are well aware that my habit is to sacrifice at all times whether in your own behalf or my own i strive in every thought word and deed to be directed as is best for yourselves and for me and in the present instance my sole object was to learn whether it were better even so much as to broach the subject and so take action or to have absolutely nothing to do with the project now silanus the soothsayer assured me by his answer of what was the main point the victims were favourable no doubt silanus knew that i was not unversed myself in his lore as i have so often assisted at the sacrifice but he added that there were symptoms in the victims of some guile or conspiracy against me that was a happy discovery on his part seeing that he was himself conspiring at the moment to traduce me before you since it was he who set the tale going that i had actually made up my mind to carry out these projects without procuring your consent now for my part if i saw that you 30 were in any difficulties i should set myself to discover how you might capture a city on the understanding of course that all who wished might sail away at once leaving those who did not wish to follow at a later date with something perhaps in their pockets to benefit their friends at home now however as i see that the men of heraclea and sinope are to send you ships to assist you to sail away and more than one person guarantees to give you regular monthly pay it is i admit a rare chance to be safely piloted to the haven of our hopes and at the same time to receive pay for our preservation for myself i have done with that dream and to those who came to me to urge these projects my advice is to have done with them in fact this is my view as long as you stay together united as to day you will command respect and procure provisions for might certainly exercises a right over what belongs to the weaker but once broken up with your force split into bits you will neither be able to get subsistence nor indeed will you get off without paying dearly for it in fact my resolution coincides precisely with yours it is that we should set off for hellas and if any one stops behind or is caught deserting before the whole army is in safety let him be judged as an evil doer pray let all who are in favour of this proposition hold up their hands
4330754 if you like you can summon an assembly and have your say
4330755 when the north wind doth blow home to hellas we will go 1
4330756 he would be a clever fellow who could befool you into embarking with a south wind blowing
4330757 nay these tales are the invention of silly fellows who are jealous of the honour you bestow on me
4330758 for myself i have done but for yourselves if any of you conceive 11 either that he himself could be the victim of a fraud or that he could victimise any one else in such a thing as this let him open his lips and explain to us how take your time but when you have sifted the matter to your hearts content do not go away without suffering me to tell you of something which i see looming if it should burst upon us and prove in fact anything like what it gives signs of being now it is time for us to take counsel for ourselves and see that we do not prove ourselves to be the worst and basest of men in the sight of gods and men be they friends or be they foes
4330759 you will not have forgotten certain places in the hills barbaric fastnesses but friendly to the cerasuntines from which people used to come down and sell us large cattle and other things which they possessed and if i mistake not some of you went to the nearest of these places and made purchases in the market and came back again
4330760 these things took place on the day on which we started to come hither on foot while some of those who were to go by sea were still at cerasus not having as yet weighed anchor
4330761 but among the hellenes still at cerasus were some of those who had escaped
4330762 the cerasuntines seeing a rush in their direction thought that without a doubt it was directed against themselves and fled with all speed and threw themselves into the sea in which proceeding they were imitated by some few of our own men and all who did not know how to swim were drowned
4330763 i say then if proceedings like this are to be the order of the day you had better consider what the ultimate condition of the army is like to be
4330764 if then you approve of such doings have a resolution passed to that effect so that with a prospect of like occurrences in the future a man may privately set up a guard and do his best to fix his tent where he can find a strong position with a commanding site if however these seem to you to be the deeds rather of wild beasts than of human beings bethink you of some means by which to stay them or else in heavens name how shall we do sacrifice to the gods gladly with impious deeds to answer for or how shall we who lay the knife to each others throats give battle to our enemies what friendly city will receive us when they see rampant lawlessness in our midst who will have the courage to afford us a market when we prove our worthlessness in these weightiest concerns and what becomes of the praise we expect to win from the mouths of men who will vouchsafe it to us if this is our behaviour should we not ourselves bestow the worst of names on the perpetrators of like deeds
4330765 where and when it was he had received these blows
4330766 when we were perishing of cold and there was a great depth of snow
4330767 upon my word with weather such as you describe when our provisions had run out when the wine could not even be smelt when numbers were dropping down dead beat so acute was the suffering with the enemy close on our heels certainly if at such a season as that i was guilty of outrage i plead guilty to being a more outrageous brute than the ass which is too wanton they say to feel fatigue still i wish you would tell us
4330768 what led to my striking you did i ask you for something and on your refusing it to me did i proceed to beat you was it a debt for which i demanded payment or a quarrel about some boy or other was i the worse for liquor and behaving like a drunkard
4330769 are you the fellow who carried home the sick man
4330770 thanks to your driving and you made havoc of my messmates kit
4330771 nay i distributed it some to one man some to another to carry and bade them bring the things safely to me and when i got them back i delivered them all safely to you and you on your side had rendered an account to me of the man let me tell you
4330772 a man was left behind from inability to proceed farther i recognised the poor fellow sufficiently to see that he was one of ours and i forced you sir to carry him to save his life for if i am not much mistaken the enemy were close at our heels
4330773 after i had sent you forward i overtook you again as i came up with the rearguard you were digging a trench with intent to bury the man i pulled up and said something in commendation as we stood by the poor fellow twitched his leg and the bystanders all cried out why the mans alive your remark was alive or not as he likes i am not going to carry him then i struck you yes you are right for it looked very much as if you knew him to be alive
4330774 was he any the less dead when i reported him to you
4330775 by the same token we shall all one day be dead but that is no reason why meantime we should all be buried alive
4330776 if xenophon had given the fellow a few more blows it might have been better
4330777 i confess sirs to having struck certain men for failure in discipline
4330778 i can imagine a third case that of some straggler stopping behind merely to rest for rests sake and hindering you in front and us behind alike from pressing on the march if he got a blow with the fist from me it saved him a thrust with the lance from the enemy in fact the opportunity they enjoy to day of taking vengeance on me for any treatment which i put upon them wrongfully is derived from their salvation then whereas if they had fallen into the enemys hands let them ask themselves for what outrage however great they could expect to get satisfaction now my defence
4330779 is simple if i chastised any one for his own good i claim to suffer the same penalties as parents pay their children or masters their boys
4330780 there is boiscus the boxer a thessalian what a battle he fought then to escape carrying his shield
4330781 it does surprise me with what keenness you remember and recount the times when i incurred the hatred of some one but some other occasions when i eased the burden of winter and storm for any of you or beat off an enemy or helped to minister to you in sickness and want not a soul of you remembers these or when for any noble deed done by any of you i praised the doer and according to my ability did honour to this brave man or that these things have slipped from your memories and are clean forgotten yet it were surely more noble just and holy sweeter and kindlier to treasure the memory of good rather than of evil
4330782 to be sure it was the women who routed the great king and drove him out of camp
4330783 it bodes not gain in money for the eagle seizes his food not when seated but on the wing
4330784 sirs i am but mortal and must needs be happy to be honoured by you i thank you and am grateful and my prayer is that the gods may grant me to be an instrument of blessing to you still when i consider it closer thus in the presence of a lacedaemonian to be preferred by you as general seems to me but ill conducive either to your interests or to mine since you will the less readily obtain from them hereafter anything you may need while for myself i look upon acceptance as even somewhat dangerous do i not see and know with what persistence these lacedaemonians prosecuted the war till finally they forced our state to acknowledge the leadership of lacedaemon this confession once extorted from their antagonists they ceased warring at once and the seige of the city was at an end if with these facts before my eyes i seem to be doing all i can to neutralise their high self esteem i cannot escape the reflection that personally i may be taught wisdom by a painful process but with your own idea that under a single general there will be less factiousness than when there were many be assured 29 that in choosing some other than me you will not find me factious i hold that whosoever sets up factious opposition to his leader factiously opposes his own safety while if you determine to choose me i should not be surprised were that choice to entail upon you and me the resentment of other people
4330785 i do not see what right we have to be officers even we who are only arcadians
4330786 let me make a clean breast of it i swear to you by all the gods and goddesses verily and indeed i no sooner perceived your purpose than i consulted the victims whether it was better for you to entrust this leadership to me and for me to undertake it or the reverse and the gods vouchsafed a sign to me so plain that even a common man might understand it and perceive that from such sovereignty i must needs hold myself aloof
4330787 nay sirs be well assured of this that had you chosen some one else i for my part should not have set up factious opposition as to xenophon i believe you have done him a good turn by not appointing him for even now dexippus has gone some way in traducing him to anaxibius as far as it lay in his power to do so and that in spite of my attempts to silence him what he said was that he believed xenophon would rather share the command of clearchuss army with timasion a dardanian than with himself a laconian but
4330788 since your choice has fallen 33 upon me i will make it my endeavour to do you all the good in my power so make your preparations to weigh anchor to morrow wind and weather permitting we will voyage to heraclea every one must endeavour therefore to put in at that port and for the rest we will consult when we are come thither
4330789 by the way i ought to have told you that as they coasted along
4330790 i am astonished sirs that the generals do not endeavour to provide us more efficiently with provisions these gifts of hospitality will not afford three days 4 victuals for the army nor do i see from what region we are to provide ourselves as we march my proposal therefore is to demand of the heracleots at least three thousand cyzicenes
4330791 not less than ten thousand let us at once before we break up this meeting send ambassadors to the city and ascertain their answer to the demand and take counsel accordingly
4330792 in the prior chapter will be found a description of the manner in which the absolute command of cheirisophus was abruptly terminated and the army of the hellenes broken up the sequel will show how each of these divisions fared
4330793 soldiers some of the arcadians are dead and the rest are being besieged upon a certain knoll
4330794 let us then at once push forward as far as may seem opportune till supper time and then encamp as long as we are marching let timasion with the cavalry gallop on in front but without losing sight of us and let him examine all closely in front so that nothing may escape our observation
4330795 we need not look to find cover in any direction for it is a long step back to heraclea and a long leap across to chrysopolis and the enemy is at the door the shortest road is to calpe haven where we suppose cheirisophus if safe to be but then when we get there at calpe haven there are no vessels for us to sail away in and if we stop here we have not provisions for a single day suppose the beleaguered arcadians left to their fate we shall find it but a sorry alternative to run the gauntlet with cheirisophuss detachment alone better to save them if we can and 17 with united forces work out our deliverance in common but if so we must set out with minds prepared since to day either a glorious death awaits us or the achievement of a deed of noblest emprise in the rescue of so many hellene lives maybe it is god who leads us thus god who chooses to humble the proud boaster boasting as though he were exceedingly wise but for us the beginning of whose every act is by heavens grace that same god reserves a higher grade of honour one duty i would recall to you to apply your minds to the execution of the orders with promptitude
4330796 when we lost sight of your watch fires we expected you to attack the enemy in the night and the enemy so at least we imagined must have been afraid of that and so set off the time at any rate at which they set off would correspond but when the requisite time had elapsed and you did not come we concluded that you must have learnt what was happening to us and in terror had made a bolt for it to the seaboard we resolved not to be left behind by you and that is how we also came to march hither
4330797 soldiers the journey must now i presume be conducted on foot indeed this is clear since we have no vessels and we are driven to commence it at once for we have no provisions if we stop we then
4330798 will sacrifice and you must prepare yourselves to fight now if ever for the spirit of the enemy has revived
4330799 the victims are as you may see for yourselves not yet favourable to the march but meanwhile i can see for myself that you are in need of provisions accordingly we must narrow the sacrifice to the particular point
4330800 naturally enough the victims are unfavourable for as i learnt from some one on a vessel which arrived here yesterday by accident cleander the governor at byzantium intends coming here with ships and men of war
4330801 it is quite possible that the enemy are collected in a body and we shall have to fight if we were to leave our baggage in the strong place
4330802 and sally forth prepared for battle the victims might favour us
4330803 no need to take us inside that place better sacrifice with all speed
4330804 if any one liked to come out and get provisions be it known that he neon would be their leader
4330805 i would advise sirs that we should detach one or more flying columns to support our main attack so that in case of need at any point we may have reserves in readiness to assist our main body and the enemy in the confusion of battle may find himself attacking the unbroken lines of troops not hitherto engaged
4330806 lead on the vanguard straight at the enemy do not let us stand parleying here now that we have caught sight of him and he of us i will detach the hindmost companies in the way we have decided upon and follow you
4330807 you know sirs i have not been in the habit hitherto of introducing you to danger which you might avoid it is not your reputation for courage surely that is at stake but your 14 safe return home but now the matter stands thus it is impossible to retire from this point without a battle if we do not advance against the enemy ourselves he will follow us as soon as we have turned our backs and attack us consider then is it better to go and meet the foe with arms advanced or with arms reversed to watch him as he assails us on our rear you know this at any rate that to retire before an enemy has nothing glorious about it whereas attack engenders courage even in a coward for my part i would rather at any time attack with half my men than retreat with twice the number as to these fellows if we attack them i am sure you do not really expect them to await us though if we retreat we know for certain they will be emboldened to pursue us nay if the result of crossing is to place a difficult gully behind us when we are on the point of engaging surely that is an advantage worth seizing at least if it were left to me i would choose that everything should appear smooth and passable to the enemy which may invite retreat but for ourselves we may bless the ground which teaches us that except in victory we have no deliverance it astonishes me that any one should deem this particular gully a whit more terrible than any of the other barriers which we have successfully passed how impassable was the plain had we failed to conquer their cavalry how insurmountable the mountains already traversed by us with all their peltasts in hot pursuit at our heels nay when we have safely reached the sea the pontus will present a somewhat formidable gully when we have neither vessels to convey us away nor corn to keep us alive whilst we stop but we shall no sooner be there than we must be off again to get provisions surely it is better to fight to day after a good breakfast than to morrow on an empty stomach sirs the offerings are favourable to us the omens are propitious the victims more than promising let us attack the enemy now that they have had a good look at us these fellows must not be allowed to enjoy their dinners or choose a camp at their own sweet will
4330808 sirs call to mind what by help of the gods you have already done bethink you of the battles you have won at close quarters with the foe of the fate which awaits those who flee before their foes forget not that we stand at the very doors of hellas follow in the steps of heracles our guide and cheer each the other onwards by name sweet were it surely by some brave and noble word or deed spoken or done this day to leave the memory of oneself in the hearts of those one loves
4330809 to keep their spears at rest on the right shoulder until the bugle signal then lower them for the charge slow march and even pace no one to quicken into a run
4330810 soldiers i cannot say that i feel disposed to make light of this business if cleander be allowed to go away as he threatens to do in his present temper towards us there are hellenic cities close by but then the lacedaemonians are the lords of hellas and they can any one of them carry out whatever they like in the cities if then the first thing this lacedaemonian does is to close the gates of byzantium and next to pass an order to the other governors city by city not to receive us because we are a set of lawless ruffians disloyal to the lacedaemonians and if further this report of us should reach the ears of their admiral anaxibius to stay or to sail away will alike be difficult remember the lacedaemonians at the present time are lords alike on land and on sea for the sake then of a single man or for two mens sake it is not right that the rest of us should be debarred from hellas but whatever they enjoin we must obey do not the cities which gave us birth yield them obedience also for my own part inasmuch as dexippus i believe keeps telling cleander that agasias would never have done this had not i xenophon bidden him i absolve you of all complicity and agasias too if agasias himself states that i am in any way a prime mover in this matter if i have set the fashion of stone throwing or any other sort of violence i condemn myself i say that i deserve the extreme penalty and i will submit to undergo it i 15 further say that if any one else is accused that man is bound to surrender himself to cleander for judgement for by this means you will be absolved entirely from the accusation but as the matter now stands it is cruel that just when we were aspiring to win praise and honour throughout hellas we are destined to sink below the level of the rest of the world banned from the hellenic cities whose common name we boast
4330811 i swear to you sirs by the gods and goddesses verily and indeed neither xenophon nor any one else among you bade me rescue the man i saw an honest man one of my own company being taken up by dexippus the man who betrayed you as you know full well that i could not endure i rescued him i admit the fact do not you deliver me up i will surrender myself as xenophon suggests to cleander to pass what verdict on me he thinks right do not for the sake of such a matter make foes of the lacedaemonians rather god grant that 1 each of you may safely reach the goal of his desire only do you choose from among yourselves and send with me to cleander those who in case of any omission on my part may by their words and acts supply what is lacking
4330812 the army has sent us to you cleander and this is their bidding if you have fault to find with all they say you ought to pass sentence on all and do with them what seems best or if the charge is against one man or two or possibly several what they expect of these people is to surrender themselves to you for judgement accordingly if you lay anything to the charge of us generals here we stand at your bar or do you impute the fault to some one not here tell us whom short of flying in the face of our authority there is no one who will absent himself
4330813 it was i cleander 21 who rescued the man before you yonder from dexippus when the latter was carrying him off and it was i who gave the order to strike dexippus my plea is that i know the prisoner to be an honest man as to dexippus i know that he was chosen by the army to command a fifty oared galley which we had obtained by request from the men of trapezus for the express purpose of collecting vessels to carry us safely home but this same dexippus betrayed his fellow soldiers with whom he had been delivered from so many perils and made off into hiding like a runaway slave whereby we have robbed the trapezuntines of their frigate and must needs appear as knaves in their eyes for this mans sake as to ourselves as far as he could he has ruined us for like the rest of us he had heard how all but impossible it was for us to retreat by foot across the rivers and to reach hellas in safety that is the stamp of man whom i robbed of his prey now had it been you yourself who carried him off or one of your emissaries or indeed any one short of a runaway from ourselves be sure that i should have acted far otherwise be assured that if you put me to death at this time you are sacrificing a good honest man for the sake of a coward and a scamp
4330814 were dexippus ever so great a scamp he ought not to suffer violence but in the language of your own demand he was entitled to a fair trial and so to obtain his deserts what i have to say at present therefore is leave your friend here and go your way and when i give the order be present at the trial i have no further charge against the army or any one since the prisoner himself admits that he rescued the man
4330815 in behalf of myself cleander if possibly you think that i was being taken up for some misdeed it is not so i neither struck nor shot i merely said the sheep are public property for it was a resolution of the soldiers that whenever the army went out as a body any booty privately obtained was to be public property that was all i said and thereupon yonder fellow seized me 28 and began dragging me off he wanted to stop our mouths so that he might have a share of the things himself and keep the rest for these buccaneers contrary to the ordinance
4330816 very well if that is your disposition you can stay behind too and we will take your case into consideration also
4330817 cleander you have the men the army has bowed to you and assented to do what you wished with respect to these two members of their body and themselves in general
4330818 nay by the twin gods i will answer you quickly enough here i make you a present of the two men and i will as you say present myself and then if the gods vouchsafe i will put myself at your head and lead you into hellas very different is your language from the tale i used to hear concerning you from certain people that you wanted to withdraw the army from allegiance to the lacedaemonians
4330819 the victims smile not on me they suffer me not to lead you home but be not out of heart at that to you it is given as it would appear to bring your men safe home forwards then and for our part whenever you come yonder we will bestow on you as warm a welcome as we may
4330820 and then it will be time enough to think about quitting the army
4330821 tell xenophon if he will do his best for me in this matter he will not regret it
4330822 the army is in any case going to cross so that as far as that is concerned seuthes is under no obligation to me or to any one else 6 but as soon as it is once across i personally shall be quit of it let seuthes therefore as far as he may deem consistent with prudence apply to those who are going to remain and will have a voice in affairs
4330823 the soldiers were to take up their arms and baggage and go forth
4330824 you will be blamed for even now certain people are disposed to hold you to account because the army is so slow in getting under weigh
4330825 nay i am not to blame for that it is the men themselves who are in want of provisions that is why they are out of heart at their exodus
4330826 i advise you to go out as if you intended to march with them and when you are well outside it will be time enough to take yourself off
4330827 any one absenting himself from the review and the muster will have himself to blame for the consequences
4330828 provisions you had better get from the thracian villages you will 13 find plenty of barley wheat and other necessaries in them and when you have got them off with you to the chersonese where cyniscus will take you into his service
4330829 was he hostile or friendly also would they have to march through the sacred mountain 1 or round about through the middle of thrace
4330830 if you do not of your own accord open the gates
4330831 now xenophon is the time to prove yourself a man you have got a city you have got triremes you have got money you have got men to day if you only chose you can do us a good turn and we will make you a great man
4330832 nay i like what you say and i will do it all but if that is what you have set your hearts on fall into rank and take up position at once
4330833 soldiers i am not surprised at your wrath or that you deem it monstrous treatment so to be cheated but consider what will be the consequences if we gratify our indignation and in return for such deception avenge ourselves on the lacedaemonians here present and plunder an innocent city
4330834 what must we anticipate will now be our fate the lacedaemonians have not only their old allies but the athenians and those who were at that time allies of athens are added to them tissaphernes and all the rest of the asiatics on the seaboard are our foes not to speak of our arch enemy the king himself up yonder whom we came to deprive of his empire and to kill if possible i ask then with all these banded together against us is there any one so insensate as to imagine that we can survive the contest for heavens sake let us not go mad or loosely throw away our lives in war with our own native cities nay our own friends our kith and our kin for in one or other of the cities they are all included every city will march against us and not unjustly if after refusing to hold one single barbarian city by right of conquest we seize the first hellenic city that we come to and make it a ruinous heap for my part my prayer is that before i see such things wrought by you i at any rate may lie ten thousand fathoms under ground my counsel to you as hellenes is to try and obtain your just rights through obedience to those who stand at the head of hellas and if so be that you fail in those demands why being more sinned against than sinning need we rob ourselves of hellas too at present i propose that we should send to anaxibius and tell him that we have made an entrance into the city not meditating violence but merely to discover if he and his will show us any good for if so it is well but of otherwise at least we will let him see that he does not shut the door upon us as dupes and fools we know the meaning of discipline we turn our backs and go
4330835 the discipline they had spoken of was not a thing they would regret indeed he would report their behaviour to the authorities at home and for himself he would take advice and do the best he could for them
4330836 any of the soldiers caught inside should be knocked down to the hammer and sold at once
4330837 i have come but i was barely able to arrange what you want anaxibius insisted it was not convenient that xenophon should be inside while the soldiers are close to the walls without the byzantines at sixes and sevens moreover and no love lost between the one party of them and the other still he ended by bidding you to come inside if you were really minded to leave the town by sea with himself
4330838 he must understand there was an end to his generalship unless he gave them provisions
4330839 i shall step to the front and command the whole army
4330840 he was to collect the scattered fragments and march them down to perinthus and thence convey them across to asia without loss of time
4330841 to escort xenophon without delay on horseback to the army
4330842 for the matter of that anaxibius is no longer admiral and i am governor in this quarter if i catch any of you at sea i will sink you
4330843 would the gods allow him to try and bring the army over to seuthes
4330844 again on a second occasion the same medosades came when i had crossed over from parium to rejoin the army and he promised me that if i would bring you the army you would in various respects treat me as a friend and brother he said especially with regard to certain seaboard places of which you are the owner and lord that you were minded to make me a present of them
4330845 recount what answer i made you and first at chalcedon
4330846 you answered that the army was in any case about to cross over to byzantium and as far as that went there was no need to pay you or any one else anything and for yourself you added that once across you were minded to leave the army which thing came to pass even as you said
4330847 at your next visit when 28 you came to me in selybria
4330848 you said that the proposal was impossible you were all going to perinthus to cross into asia
4330849 and in spite of it all at the present moment here i am myself and phryniscus one of my colleagues and polycrates yonder a captain and outside to represent the other generals all except neon the laconian the trustiest men they could find to send so that if you wish to give these transactions the seal of still greater security you have nothing to do but to summon them also and do you polycrates go and say from me that i bid them leave their arms outside and you can leave your own sword outside before you enter with them on your return
4330850 i should never mistrust an athenian for we are relatives already 3 i know and the best of friends i believe we shall be
4330851 maesades was my father his sway extended over the melanditae the thynians and the tranipsae then the affairs of the odrysians took a bad turn and my father was driven out of this country and later on died himself of sickness leaving me to be brought up as an orphan at the court of medocus the present king but i when i had grown to mans estate could not endure to live with my eyes fixed on anothers board so i seated myself on the seat by him as a suppliant and begged him to give me as many men as he could spare that i might wreak what mischief i could on those who had driven us forth from our land that thus i might cease to live in dependence upon anothers board like a dog watching his masters hand in answer to my petition he gave me 34 the men and the horses which you will see at break of day and nowadays i live with these pillaging my own ancestral land but if you would join me i think with the help of heaven we might easily recover my empire that is what i want of you
4330852 supposing we came what should you be able to give us the soldiers the officers and the generals tell us that these witnesses may report your answer
4330853 to the common soldiers a cyzicene 4 to a captain twice as much and to a general four times as much with as much land as ever they liked some yoke of oxen and a fortified place upon the seaboard
4330854 we fail of success in spite of our endeavours suppose any intimidation on the part of the lacedaemonians should arise will you receive into your country any of us who may seek to find a refuge with you
4330855 nay not only so but i shall look upon you as my brothers entitled to share my seat and the joint possessors of all the wealth which we may be able to acquire and to you yourself o xenophon i will give my daughter and if you have a daughter i will buy her in thracian fashion and i will give you bisanthe as a dwelling place which is the fairest of all my possessions on the seaboard 5
4330856 men aristarchus with his ships of war hinders us from sailing where we fain would go it is not even safe to set foot on 3 board a vessel but if he hinders us here he hastens us there be off to the chersonese says he force a passage through the sacred mountain if we master it and succeed in getting to that place he has something in store for us he promises that he will not sell you any more as he did at byzantium you shall not be cheated again you shall have pay he will no longer as now suffer you to remain in want of provisions that is his proposal but seuthes says that if you will go to him he will treat you well what you have now to consider is whether you will stay to debate this question or leave its settlement till we have gone up into a land of provisions if you ask me my opinion it is this since here we have neither money to buy nor leave to take without money what we need why should we not go up into these villages where the right to help ourselves is conferred by might there unhampered by the want of bare necessaries you can listen to what this man and the other wants of you and choose whichever sounds best let those
4330857 and get your kit together and at the word of command follow your leader
4330858 we are going where the troops will have enough to live upon when we are there we will listen to you and to the emissaries of the laconian and choose between you both whatever seems best if then you will lead us where provisions are to be got in plenty we shall feel indebted to you for your hospitality
4330859 for the matter of that i know many villages close packed and stocked with all kinds of provisions just far enough 9 off to give you a good appetite for your breakfasts
4330860 my request to you sirs is that you will take the field with me and my promise to you is that i will give every man of you a cyzicene and to the officers and generals at the customary rate besides this i will honour those who show special merit food and drink you shall get as now for yourselves from the country but whatever is captured i shall claim to have myself so that by distribution of it i may provide you with pay let them flee let them creep into hiding places we shall be able to pursue after them we will track them out or if they resist along with you we will endeavour to subdue them to our hands
4330861 and how far from the sea shall you expect the army to follow you
4330862 what seuthes said was very right it was winter and for a man to sail home even if he had the will to do so was impossible on the other hand to continue long in a friendly country where they must depend upon what they could purchase was equally beyond their power if they were to wear away time and support life in a hostile country it was safer to do so with seuthes than by themselves not to speak of all these good things but if they were going to get pay into the bargain that indeed was a godsend
4330863 if any one opposes the measure let him state his views if not let the officer put the proposition to the vote
4330864 medocus is up country twelve days journey from the sea but seuthes now that he has got this army will be lord on the sea coast as your neighbour then he is the man to do you good or do you ill if you are wise you will give him whatever he askes of you on the whole it will be laid out at better interest than if you have it to medocus who lives so far off
4330865 it is customary when people are invited to dinner by seuthes for the guests to make him a present now if he should become a great person in these parts he will be able to restore you to your native land or to make you a rich man here
4330866 you are at once a citizen of no mean city and with seuthes also your own name is very great maybe you expect to obtain a fort or two in this country just as others of your countrymen have done 2 and territory it is only right and proper therefore that you should honour seuthes in the most magnificent style be sure i give this advice out of pure friendliness for i know that the greater the gift that you are ready to bestow on him the better the treatment you will receive at his hands
4330867 he is more at leisure i have something better to do at present
4330868 heres a health to thee o seuthes let me present thee with this horse mounted on him thou shalt capture whom thou choosest to pursue or retiring from battle thou shalt not dread the foe
4330869 it was a good old custom and a fine one too that those who had should give to the king for honours sake but to those who had not the king should give whereby my lord
4330870 i too may one day have the wherewithal to give thee gifts and honour
4330871 i also seuthes have to present you with myself and these my dear comrades to be your trusty friends and not one of them against his will they are more ready one and all still more than i to be your friends here they are they ask nothing from you in return rather they are forward to labour in your behalf it will be their pleasure to bear the brunt of battle in voluntary service with them god willing you will gain vast territory you will recover what was once your forefathers you will win for yourself new lands and not lands only but horses many and of men a multitude and many a fair dame besides you will not need to seize upon them in robber fashion it is your friends here who of their own accord shall take and bring them to you they shall lay them at your feet as gifts
4330872 since no interval except the octave dia pason could be magidised the effect of any other is well known to be intolerable therefore no other interval was employed at all
4330873 since between your thracian foes and our thracian friends there might be some confusion
4330874 sirs our enemies are not aware as yet of our alliance if therefore we attack them before they take precautions not to be caught or are prepared to repel assault we shall make a fine haul of captives and other stock
4330875 prepare and wait as soon as the right time comes i will be with you i shall pick up the peltasts and yourselves and with the help of the gods i will lead on
4330876 if we are to march by night is not the hellenic fashion best when marching in the daytime that part of the army leads the van which seems best suited to the nature of the country to be traversed heavy or light infantry or cavalry but by night our rule is that the slowest arm should take the lead thus we avoid the risk of being pulled to pieces and it is not so easy for a man to give his neighbour the slip without intending whereas the scattered fragments of an army are apt to fall foul of one another and to cause damage or incur it in sheer ignorance
4330877 you reason well and i will adopt your custom i will furnish you with guides chosen from the oldest experts of the country and i will myself follow with the cavalry in the rear it will not take me long if need be to present myself at the front
4330878 we find ourselves at dawn of day all happily together just as we ought to be do you wait for me here
4330879 and recruit yourselves i will take a look round and rejoin you
4330880 god willing sirs it will be all right we shall fall on the fellows before they know where they are i will lead on with the cavalry so that if we catch sight of any one he shall not escape and give warning to the enemy do you follow and if you are left behind keep to the trail of the horses once on the other side of the mountains we shall find ourselves in numerous thriving villages
4330881 i will at once send off the cavalry into the plain below and the peltasts too to attack the villages do you follow with what speed you may so that in case of resistance you may lend us your aid
4330882 why do you dismount just when speed is the thing we want
4330883 but you do not want me alone i am sure the hoplites will run all the quicker and more cheerily if i lead them on foot
4330884 well xenophon this is just what you said the fellows are caught but now look here my cavalry have gone off unsupported they are scattered in pursuit one here one there and upon my word i am more than half afraid the enemy will collect somewhere and do them a mischief some of us must remain in the villages for they are swarming with human beings
4330885 i will seize the heights with the men i have with me and do you bid cleanor extend his line along the level beside the villages
4330886 strike if the boy bids you and will thank his preserver
4330887 it is time you did battle with me seuthes for my boy never will i yield him up
4330888 to bivouac in a strong position in the open than under cover on the edge of destruction
4330889 come out xenophon and die like a man or we will roast you alive inside
4330890 to do all that he demanded let him take pledges of their good faith
4330891 for my part i should think their punishment is great enough already if they are to be slaves instead of free men still
4330892 i advise you for the future to take as hostages those who are most capable of doing mischief and to let the old men abide in peace at home
4330893 make a present of these to my friends here the generals who have served with me and to the officers
4330894 upon my word heracleides i do not think you care for seuthes interest as you should if you did you have been at pains to bring back the full amount of the pay even if you had had to raise a loan to do so and if by no other means by selling the coat off your own back
4330895 the rugged salmudesian jaw of the black sea inhospitable to sailors stepmother of ships
4330896 the best thing that could have happened the lacedaemonians want these troops and you have done with them so that if you hand over the troops to them you will do the lacedaemonians a good turn and will cease to be bothered for pay any more the country will be quit of them once and for ever
4330897 not a bad fellow in most respects but he is too much the soldiers friend and that is why it goes ill with him
4330898 he will oppose our taking away the troops will he not
4330899 but you have only to call a meeting of the whole body and promise them pay and little further heed will they pay to him they will run off with you
4330900 as soon as they set eyes on you they will flock to you with alacrity
4330901 the lacedaemonians have resolved on war with tissaphernes who did you so much wrong by going with us therefore you will punish your enemy and each of you will get a daric a month the officers twice that sum and the generals quadruple
4330902 for the matter of that lacedaemonians we should have been by your sides long ago if xenophon had not persuaded us and brought us hither we have never ceased campaigning night and day the dismal winter through but he reaps the fruit of our toils seuthes has enriched him privately but deprives us of our honest earnings so that standing here as i do to address you first all i can say is that if i might see the fellow stoned to death as a penalty for all the long dance he has led us i 10 should feel i had got my pay in full and no longer grudge the pains we have undergone
4330903 true is the old adage there is nothing which mortal man may not expect to see
4330904 but when aristarchus came with his ships of war and hindered our passage across you will hardly quarrel with me for the step i then took in calling you together that we might advisedly consider our best course
4330905 some one may say are you not ashamed to be so taken in like a fool
4330906 but you will say i ought to have taken security of him at the time so that had he fostered the wish he might have lacked the ability to decieve
4330907 supposing that without making any demands for pay whatever i had merely won for you the alliance of seuthes whose cavalry and light infantry were just what you needed would you not have thought that i had planned very well for you
4330908 but let me ask you in what condition do you turn your backs on this 31 land to day
4330909 thus far i have confined myself to your side of the matter bear with me i beg you while we examine mine when i first essayed to part with you and journey homewards i was doubly blest from your lips i had won some praise and thanks to you i had obtained glory from the rest of hellas i was trusted by the lacedaemonians else would they not have sent me back to you whereas to day i turn to go calumniated before the lacedaemonians by yourselves detested in your behalf by seuthes whom i meant so to benefit by help of you that i should find in him a refuge for myself and for my children if children i might have in after time and you the while for whose sake i have incurred so much hate the hate of people far superior to me in strength you for whom i have not yet ceased to devise all the good i can entertain such sentiments about me why i am no renegade or runaway slave you have got hold of if you carry out what you say be sure you will have done to death a man who has passed many a vigil in watching over you who has shared with you many a toil and run many a risk in turn and out of turn who thanks to the gracious gods has by your side set up full many a trophy over the barbarian who lastly has strained every nerve in his body to protect you against yourselves and so it is that to day you can move freely where you choose by sea or by land and no one can say you nay and you on 37 whom this large liberty dawns who are sailing to a long desired goal who are sought after by the greatest of military powers who have pay in prospect and for leaders these lacedaemonians our acknowledged chiefs now is the appointed time you think to put me to a speedy death but in the days of our difficulties it was very different o ye men of marvellous memory no in those days you called me father and you promised you would bear me ever in mind your benefactor not so however not so ungracious are those who have come to you to day nor if i mistake not have you bettered yourselves in their eyes by your treatment of me
4330910 nay by the twins you are wrong surely in your anger against this man i myself can bear testimony in his favour when polynicus and i asked seuthes what sort of a man he was seuthes answered he had but one fault to find with him that he was too much the soldiers friend which also was the cause why things went wrong with him whether as regards us lacedaemonians or himself seuthes
4330911 yes sirs and what strikes me is that you cannot begin your generalship of us better than by exacting from seuthes our pay whether he like it or no let him pay in full and do not take us away before
4330912 if my eyes do not deceive me sirs there stands heracleides yonder the man who received the property won by our toil who took and sold it and never gave back either to seuthes or to us the proceeds of the sale but kept the money to himself like the thief he is if we are wise we will lay hold of him for he is no thracian but a hellene and against hellenes is the wrong he has committed
4330913 if we are wise we will get away from here out of reach of these fellows
4330914 whether it were better and happier to stay with seuthes on the terms proposed or depart with the army
4330915 you are doing wrong to pillage our villages we give you fair warning i in behalf of seuthes and this man by my side who comes from medocus the king up country to begone out of the land if you refuse understand we have no notion of handing it over to you but if you injure our country we will retaliate upon you as foes
4330916 such language addressed to us by you of all people is hard to answer yet for the sake of the young man with you i will attempt to do so that at least he may learn how different your nature is from ours we
4330917 before we were your friends had the free run of this country moving this way or that as it took our fancy pillaging and 5 burning just as we chose and you yourself medosades whenever you came to us on an embassy camped with us without apprehension of any foe as a tribe collectively you scarcely approached the country at all or if you found yourselves in it you bivouacked with your horses bitted and bridled as being in the territory of your superiors presently you made friends with us and thanks to us by gods help you have won this country out of which to day you seek to drive us a country which we held by our own strength and gave to you no hostile force as you well know was capable of expelling us it might have been expected of you personally to speed us on our way with some gift in return for the good we did you not so even though our backs are turned to go we are too slow in our movements for you you will not suffer us to take up quarters even if you can help it and these words arouse no shame in you either before the gods or this odrysian in whose eyes to day you are man of means though until you cultivated our friendship you lived a robbers life as you have told us however why do you address yourself to me i am no longer in command our generals are the lacedaemonians to whom you and yours delivered the army for withdrawal and that without even inviting me to attend you most marvellous of men so that if i lost their favour when i brought you the troops i might now win their gratitude by restoring them
4330918 for my part medosades i sink under the earth for very shame at what i hear if i had known the truth before i would never have accompanied you as it is i return at once never would king medocus applaud me if i drove forth his benefactors
4330919 you will be able to recover the pay which is owing to the army you can say to them that the army has requested you to assist in exacting their pay from seuthes whether he like it or not that they have promised as soon as they get this cheerfully to follow you that the demand seems to you to be only just and that you have accordingly promised not to leave until the soldiers have got their dues
4330920 if you have anything to say to us medosades say it but if not we have something to say to you
4330921 and seuthes says the same we think we have a right to ask that those who have become our friends should not be ill treated by you whatever ill you do to them you really do to us for they are a part of us
4330922 and we intend to go away as soon as those who won for you the people and the territory in question have got their pay failing that we are coming without further delay to assist them and to punish certain others who have broken their oaths and done them wrong if it should turn out that you come under this head when we come to exact justice we shall begin with you
4330923 would you prefer medosades to leave it to these people themselves in whose country we are your friends since this is the designation you prefer to decide by ballot which of the two should leave the country you or we
4330924 seuthes i am here to advance no claims but to show you if i can 21 how unjust it was on your part to be angered with me because i zealously demanded of you on behalf of the soldiers what you promised them
4330925 try and recall to mind in your own case what advance of money you made to us to purchase our alliance
4330926 you cannot forget that your present vassals were not persuaded to become your subjects out of love for you but by sheer force and but for some restraining dread they would endeavour to be free again to morrow
4330927 again the country is now yours and from this time forward you have to make provision for what is yours and how will you best secure it an immunity from ill
4330928 heracleides as he used to prove to me finds the sum excessive
4330929 well seuthes for myself these remarks are the expression of friendly forethought for a friend
4330930 all men believe i think that a fund of kindly feeling is due to him from whom we accept gifts but what is your behaviour before i had ministered to you in any way or done you a single service you welcomed me kindly with your eyes your voice your hospitality and you could not sate yourself with promises of all the fine things that were to follow but having once achieved your object and become the great man you now are as great indeed as i could make you you can stand by and see me degraded among my own soldiers well time will teach you that i fully believe to pay whatever seems to you right and even without the lessons of that teacher you will hardly care to see whose who have spent themselves in benefiting you become your accusers only when you do pay your debt i beg of you to use your best endeavour to right me with the soldiers leave me at least where you found me that is all i ask
4330931 i never had any idea of robbing you of your just dues i will repay
4330932 since you are minded to pay i only ask that you will do so through me and will not suffer me on your account to hold a different position in the army from what i held when we joined you
4330933 as far as that goes so far from holding a less honoured position among your own men on my account if you will stay with me keeping only a thousand heavy infantry i will deliver to you the fortified places and everything i promised
4330934 on these terms i may not accept them only let us go 51 free
4330935 that it is safer for you to bide with me than to go away
4330936 for your forethought i thank you but i may not stay somewhere i may rise to honour and that be sure shall redound to your gain also
4330937 of silver i have but little that little however i give to you one talent but of beeves i can give you six hundred head and of sheep four thousand and of slaves six score these take and the hostages besides who wronged you and begone
4330938 but supposing these all together do not amount to the pay for whom is the talent shall i say it is a little dangerous for myself is it not i think i had better be on the look out for stones when i return you heard the threats
4330939 thanks to your intervention this much has been saved for the army my duty is to deliver this fraction over to your keeping do you divide and distribute it to the soldiers
4330940 at this moment the vote of banishment had not been passed which would prevent his return to athens
4330941 upon my word i shall have barely enough to get home unless i sell my horse and what i have about my person
4330942 now i believe what you said about having no money but i am certain
4330943 if it were ever to come there is an obstacle in the way if nothing else you are that obstacle yourself
4330944 zeus meilichios 2 is an obstacle to you i am sure
4330945 have you tried sacrificing to that god as i was wont to sacrifice and offer whole burnt offerings for you at home
4330946 if you take thirty men and go by night you will take him prisoner
4330947 wife children money and all of money he has a store
4330948 they had no notion of sharing their portion of the spoil
4330949 just as though the property lay already at their feet

4330954 you half naked you fully naked you cripple you fatherless you motherless
4330955 last night maybe im just not as sensitive to racial stuff as most people but i was able to push aside the shock
4330956 percayalah masalah yang kita hadapi masalah ini juga dihadapi bangsa bangsa lain apa pun masalahnya kapan pun masanya seberapa pun keterbatasannya kalau kita bermental bisa kita semua bisa dan indonesia pasti bisa
4330957 kita tidak punya alasan dan tidak ada waktu untuk mengeluh dan berpangku tangan kita tidak bisa tenggelam dalam budaya sinisme dan sifat gamang yang tak kunjung habis
4330958 just touched base with benny feilhabers agent lyle yorks who is in aarhus denmark with the usa olympian he had his medical and if all of the final details are agreed he will sign in the morning yorks told the insider derby county feilhabers current club will let him go on a free transfer feilhaber would join another american jeremiah white at the ambitious danish club well see if this gets done in the next 24 hrs
4330959 i wake up at 4 30 5 fall back asleep
4330960 it takes me a while to wake up in the morning
4330961 hes swimming incredibly well breaking records by over a second
4330962 no ones ever done that in this sport but if he doesnt maybe that means somewhere along the line i did something
4330963 you must stay in the haunted house all night to get the inheritance
4330964 im very sad to leave the system ive put 35 years in i think ive served the students in this community to the best of my ability
4330965 students always came first when i was teacher and when i was a superintendent
4330966 what i do remember is working with a lot of very experienced english teachers who gave you strong suggestions and liked to share in the creativity of someone young
4330967 the english department here was wonderful the director and all the teachers were wonderful people to have as mentors they helped guide you to continue to love what you did on a day to day basis
4330968 i havent sat back and done nothing in my 10 years as a superintendent a lot of people here whether its been my idea or not they came forward and we worked together
4330969 it was a nice collaborative effort to bring forth some good programs for students in the city
4330970 ive had a lot of fun doing things whether it was the all night party scooping ice cream after the prom or assessing what the needs are in classrooms
4330971 its been a wonderful experience working with and for the teachers and the administrators in this system and in the city of waltham
4330972 this district needs to look at what all school districts are looking at its the global economy the district needs to look at bringing in foreign languages at the elementary schools
4330973 we need to get our children interested whether it be engineering or learning a foreign language we want our kids to be able to compete and capture jobs and keep jobs here in the u s
4330974 ive had some individuals approach me asking if i wanted to do some consulting or some teaching
4330975 i was asked to even take on a temporary superintendent position but i havent made a decision teaching and consulting will probably be what ill aim towards
4330976 the superpower showed that she was able to defend her people
4330977 there is virtue in simplicity in the life of the ascetic or the hermit there is nothing to distract one from the true ways from the contemplation of the high one one may rightfully withdraw to such a life when ones worldly tasks are done to prepare oneself to pass beyond
4330978 theres got to be at least 25 000 hidden in your house we can help you find it
4330979 calling it a second mortgage thats like hocking your house
4330980 but call it equity access and it sounds more innocent
4330981 its very difficult for one advertiser to come to you and change your perspective
4330982 but as it becomes socially acceptable for everyone to accumulate debt everyone does
4330983 youve put a lot of work into your home isnt it time for your home to return the favor
4330984 there is now a concrete proposal with the turkish cypriot association which shows the progress that has been made
4330985 this process only started last september and these types of negotiations are not easy
4330986 i saw this pair on my ride home after work this week use it as you wish
4330987 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4330988 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4330989 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4330990 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4330991 the ntsb has been very concerned about the air tour industry for some time
4330992 we are accident investigators and we look very very closely at all aspects of the accident in this case we felt that there were some deficiencies and the recommendations hopefully will bridge that gap
4330993 we have 90 days to respond to the ntsbs recommendations and we will get back to them with an answer
4330994 in general however we agree with the majority of their recommendations and will end up implementing them
4330995 theres a tremendous amount of air traffic that goes through that small area and the addition of weather cameras is a wonderful idea
4330996 the gratuitous suggestion of a quid pro quo relationship would only serve to inflame the jury and create unfair prejudice against senator stevens
4330997 even if those staffers did not themselves testify before the grand jury it is equally problematic if fbi agents summarized testimony about protected information to the grand jury
4330998 yet the indictment does not describe the alleged falsity or concealment with any degree of specificity
4330999 these allegations are insufficient as a matter of law to provide senator stevens with fair notice of the charges against him or to ensure that the grand jury properly returned an indictment in this matter
4331000 he is constitutionally owed a statement of the specific charges against him a requirement not satisfied by a recitation of facts followed by general allegations

4331003 the west confronts an unfamiliar sight a nation bent on conquest
4331004 that 20 000 plats could equate to 60 000 or more people along that corridor
4331005 we felt that we really should have done this 10 years ago but we cant start it 10 years ago we can only start it today
4331006 from a purely planning perspective we are looking at the widest scenario but that is not to say that is what it will ultimately be in every area
4331007 right now it is a planning study until you get to the actual design once we get to a preferred alignment based on all the input and the constraints then you do a more detailed schematic at that point in time we would know more about what that footprint will look like
4331008 the point i made in commissioners court is that given the numbers im questioning the need for 400 feet of right of way
4331009 it may be less but im just saying they are going to need to justify it because obviously you can build six lanes in 200 feet of right of way
4331010 the positive side of buying right of way now is it will be way cheaper today than it will be in the future
4331011 the negative side of it is that if you say this is where our corridor is going and dont actually purchase that property then really youve harmed those property owners then they cant ever sell their property you cant do that to people
4331012 txdot should be out here designating and buying right of way and everything else
4331013 the county shouldnt have to do it but the county cant wait for txdot to get its business in order
4331014 this is not one of the projects they had planned but northern williamson county has been largely underestimated in terms of population growth
4331015 we live it and see it every day and that is why we took the lead on this so that we could do this study and identify where the road alignment needs to be in the future
4331016 we said in october when we had our first meeting that we would try to move forward with this as fast as we could because we realize that peoples lives are interrupted as a result of this study
4331017 we are not trying to drag this out in fact we have sped it up but this is the process we have to go through
4331018 we felt that we really should have done this 10 years ago but we cant start it 10 years ago we can only start it today
4331019 information developed during the course of the sh 29 corridor study
4331020 given the obvious risks and financial consequences of over predicting growth
4331021 oak hill is underserved they want a town center and more services thats how this whole thing got started
4331022 our site cant do it all but we can start to meet the needs of oak hill
4331023 every time someone asked for something and we were able to do it weve done it
4331024 theres not a single plan that everyone will like but were trying to put the best project out there for our client that also fits the needs of the community
4331025 the houses are out here in oak hill but the retail is not
4331026 well probably have a good blend of national and local retailers were trying to recreate room for the local guys
4331027 we wanted to meet and address the goals with the community before we filed the application with the city
4331028 but filing with the city doesnt stop the conversation with oak hill
4331029 how many places will be empty then if you build 1 million sq ft if there are empty spaces now
4331030 were asking the pud to join neighbors to the east to work with everyone so we dont get blight and can have a transit oriented development with community amenities
4331031 theyre concerned that y businesses will move to the pud but we dont think that will happen
4331032 new businesses will move in the pud will be the catalyst to spur redevelopment of oak hill
4331033 oak hill has been neglected by the city and were trying to change that
4331034 we are considering the possibility of a convenient care model that could be open for patients with commercial care but this would be a medical home for patients that meet our financial eligibility and do not have insurance
4331035 what they did is they saw this property they decided it was a good location and they went for it without community input
4331036 first and foremost we have fought things associated with zoning changes on that property before
4331037 at the end of the day if the data supports this location as being the best spot for the clinic i think that the residents immediately around that area are still going to have an issue with the zoning change
4331038 i agree a smooth start was not done here and i commit to correcting that
4331039 believe me that the intent for all of us is how to get maximum input
4331040 if we were to ask residents of every location we would never pick a spot
4331041 i would be concerned if it was going in my neighborhood
4331042 i dont want to be involved in the design of a building when i dont believe that building should be located there
4331043 i say please lets rewind lets start the process over lets look at the data and lets bring in the neighborhoods in north austin and east austin
4331044 the way we set up our clinics is theyre disbursed but close to where the individuals that use it are
4331045 our intent is to be convenient to the clients we serve
4331046 i understand in some of the locations they didnt want to have to renovate the buildings and so thats why they werent chosen
4331047 however i think that probably in the rush to just buy the land and to build brand new they didnt really carefully look at all their options i think that theres some way this can turn into a win win where they could get the land they want in a location that better serves the clients in the communities and where all the neighborhoods involved would be happy with the deal
4331048 theres just some other vacant office lots within my neighborhood that i feel would really really be a good idea to see if tchd would be open to purchasing one of those properties close to us 183 to locate a new facility
4331049 there are so many potential properties around the 183 area that are already empty medical office space or just general warehouse space large buildings that are just sitting vacant
4331050 im going to do the best i can to represent not only the people who voted for me but the people who voted against me
4331051 all thats necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing
4331052 there were a number of improvements that needed to be made to the treatment plant in order for this to happen
4331053 each water treatment plant operates differently depending on where the water is coming from taylor has good water there is not a lot of iron or magnesium which will make a plant go crazy
4331054 part of the reason for the new intake facility is so that we dont have to worry about changes in sediment when it floods and we dont have to worry about trees taking out the intake station
4331055 i do not mean to create the impression as though i did not live before this but in reality i first live now now that i have been delivered from the law from sin and death being crucified with christ and dead unto the law i may now rise unto a new and better life
4331056 i live not i am dead i am not dead i am a sinner i am not a sinner i have the law i have no law
4331057 i am now one with christ therefore christs righteousness victory and life are mine
4331058 i am that big sinner his sins and his death are mine because he is joined to me and i to him
4331059 why then let us reject the law if grace abounds where sin abounds let us abound in sin that grace may all the more abound
4331060 i live by the faith of the son of god
4331061 my speech is no longer directed by the flesh but by the holy ghost my sight is no longer governed by the flesh but by the holy ghost my hearing is no longer determined by the flesh but by the holy ghost i cannot teach write pray or give thanks without the instrumentality of the flesh yet these activities do not proceed from the flesh but from god
4331062 god will no more require of man than of himself perform he can
4331063 he loved me and gave himself for me he found in me no right mind and no good will but the good lord had mercy upon me out of pure kindness he loved me loved me so that he gave himself for me that i should be free from the law from sin devil and death
4331064 the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
4331065 our single biggest challenge is to keep up with the population so we dont get behind the growth curve
4331066 as the population grows the number of crimes grows with it
4331067 im very pleased that council is receptive to the five year hiring plan
4331068 i think everyone has the same desire to have a safe community and they realize this is the only way to do it
4331069 we have to keep a handle on crime and we have to do the best we can to prevent it deter it and when it does happen to clear it solve it and bring people to justice
4331070 when i came here in 1999 we were strictly a patrol department
4331071 since that time we have grown into what i call a full service police department
4331072 the functions of this facility allow us to better serve the community and give everyone a better experience when they come to the police station
4331073 the officers have more room and were getting more done more efficiently
4331074 the more we take care of crime now the less we have to worry about it down the road
4331075 growth is certainly a challenge but we feel that we are prepared to handle it
4331076 with the tolls and arterial roads pflugerville is much more attractive to developers
4331077 with that the land increases in value the changes in zoning are really an indication of the maturation of the community
4331078 the citys code is to notify property owners who live within 500 feet of property being considered for rezoning even though the state only requires 200 feet
4331079 the communitys input and involvement is critical though and as a reflection we are researching best practices of notification in other cities we are also working with the pflugerville council of neighborhood associations to begin distributing notifications via e mail to neighborhood leaders
4331080 the adjacency concerns are not uncommon and the things we struggle with as a community with regard to adjacency issues are not unique to pflugerville
4331081 the challenges that each community faces and how they handle it in their own way is to address adjacency in a way that is acceptable reasonable and appropriate
4331082 it comes back to having a comprehensive plan and associated policies goals and objectives that are a reasonable reflection of the communitys wants and desires
4331083 so as zonings and developments occur there should be few surprises to the community
4331084 there is no home building going on right now and foreclosures are occurring
4331085 there is a market for apartments people want to locate here permanently and they need an interim solution
4331086 the arrangements of the zoning districts are purposefully scattered and the goal would be to spread them out
4331087 planning is not all economic development but economic development is not successful without planning the more employers the city is able to attract to the area the higher the demand there is for various forms of housing and now more than ever people need to live close to where they work the city must encompass a diverse housing stock for us to compete within the region employers look for that when choosing where to locate
4331088 if im spending around 200 to 250 million on a project that im going to own in pflugerville forever why would i sell a 2 to 3 million tract of land to greystar if i wasnt confident in what they were going to do with it
4331089 we only get to not do what we say were going to do once and then im out of business
4331090 but in this particular situation when he told me they would be 70 percent one bedroom i thought yay
4331091 if we leave it and there are one to two kids per apartment which is what is likely to happen with the way it was already zoned it would burden the schools
4331092 and if we put this many houses on the property which statistics show would likely have 2 5 kids each that would still be over 200 to 300 kids being added to highland park elementary at least with the one bedroom apartments its not going to significantly affect the school
4331093 its just not a feasible way to get there and most people wouldnt even know how to get through it
4331094 its a swing of millions of dollars to our project but we didnt think the project could move forward
4331095 this is obviously a very special piece of land in pflugerville and being at the crossroads of 685 and pecan it would form a visual image of pflugerville
4331096 it really needs some out of the box thinking something that would really set the tone for the way pflugerville wants to look
4331097 one of the things i hope to try for in the notification is that i will be able to notify not only on zoning changes but also notify neighborhoods about first readings for development conceptual plans
4331098 they want to just change the rules so they can build something there
4331099 but the neighborhoods are very concerned about the actual building and development thats going to take place there which isnt always addressed in the zoning
4331100 well she did just get a huge dose of sugar i mean hell i am starting to jitter as well
4331101 the cost in terms of liberties lost and the unnecessary exposure to terrorism are difficult to determine but in time it will become apparent to all of us that foreign interventionism is of no benefit to american citizens but is instead a threat to our liberties
4331102 if you dont have anything to hide why should you be afraid
4331103 oh doctor i feel as if there is a snake writhing inside my spine and street lights blow out when i walk under them christ visited me saying i should be more forgiving sometimes i feel as if there is a hole between my eyebrows and often i feel like im wearing a helmet i see lights behind my closed eyes and i see ghosts or people that walk through the walls i also see faces when i close my eyes i hear a constant hum and the sounds of millions of bees and crickets and my body twists into these yoga like positions at night when i sleep and often during the day sometimes i know what people are thinking and sometimes i have an orgasm every twenty feet when im out shopping oh doctor whats wrong with me

4331119 is that heavier demands are exacted from us as from men who will readily submit a single king once ruled us now two are set over us a legate to tyrannise over our lives a procurator to tyrannise over our property their quarrels and their harmony are alike ruinous to their subjects the centurions of the one the slaves of the other combine violence with insult nothing is now safe from their avarice nothing from their lust in war it is the strong who plunders now it is for the most part by cowards and poltroons that our homes are rifled our children torn from us the conscription enforced as though it were for our country alone that we could not die for after all what a mere handful of soldiers has crossed over if we britons look at our own numbers germany did thus shake off the yoke and yet its defence was a river not the ocean with us fatherland wives parents are the motives to war with them only greed and profligacy they will surely fly as did the now deified julius if once we emulate the valour of our sires let us not be panic stricken at the result of one or two engagements the miserable have more fury and greater resolution now even the gods are beginning to pity us for they are keeping away the roman general and detaining his army far from us in another island we have already taken the hardest step we are deliberating and indeed in all such designs to dare is less perilous than to be detected
4331120 whenever i consider the origin of this war and the necessities of our position i have a sure confidence that this day and this union of yours will be the beginning of freedom to the whole of britain
4331121 nature has willed that every mans children and kindred should be his dearest objects
4331122 do you suppose that the romans will be as brave in war as they are licentious in peace to our strifes and discords they owe their fame and they turn the errors of an enemy to the renown of their own army an army which composed as it is of every variety of nations is held together by success and will be broken up by disaster these gauls and germans and i blush to say these britons who though they lend their lives to support a strangers rule have been its enemies longer than its subjects you cannot imagine to be bound by fidelity and affection fear and terror there certainly are feeble bonds of attachment remove them and those who have ceased to fear will begin to hate all the incentives to victory are on our side the romans have no wives to kindle their courage no parents to taunt them with flight man have either no country or one far away few in number dismayed by their ignorance looking around upon a sky a sea and forests which are all unfamiliar to them hemmed in as it were and enmeshed the gods have delivered them into our hands be not frightened by the idle display by the glitter of gold and of silver which can neither protect nor wound in the very ranks of the enemy we shall find our own forces britons will acknowledge their own cause gauls will remember past freedom the other germans will abandon them as but lately did the usipii behind them there is nothing to dread the forts are ungarrisoned the colonies in the hands of aged men what with disloyal subjects and oppressive rulers the towns are ill affected and rife with discord on the one side you have a general and an army on the other tribute the mines and all the other penalties of an enslaved people whether you endure these for ever or instantly avenge them this field is to decide think therefore as you advance to battle at once of your ancestors and of your posterity
4331123 comrades this is the eighth year since thanks to the greatness and good fortune of rome and to your own loyalty and energy you conquered britain
4331124 if unknown nations and an untried enemy confronted you i should urge you on by the example of other armies as it is look back upon your former honours question your own eyes these are the men who last year under cover of darkness attacked a single legion whom you routed by a shout of all the britons these are the most confirmed runaways and this is why they have survived so long just as when the huntsman penetrates the forest and the thicket all the most courageous animals rush out upon him while the timid and feeble are scared away by the very sound of his approach so the bravest of the britons have long since fallen and the rest are a mere crowd of spiritless cowards you have at last found them not because they have stood their ground but because they have been overtaken their desperate plight and the extreme terror that paralyses them have rivetted their line to this spot that you might achieve in it a splendid and memorable victory put an end to campaigns crown your fifty years service with a glorious day prove to your country that her armies could never have been fairly charged with protracting a war or with causing a rebellion

4331153 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4331154 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle

4331194 ce nest pas la chine de fixer ni mon agenda ni mes rendez vous
4331195 no tengo nada que ver con estas decisiones ni me interesa y me equivocar a si me metiera en esos temas no dejo de decir que me gusta que me agrada la pol tica pero hoy s que mi rol no es ser delantero mi rol es formar parte de un equipo t cnico a otros personajes a otros les toca estar en la cancha son otros los que tienen que meter los goles llevarse los aplausos otros los que tienen que jugar y aparecer en los peri dicos
4331196 im just like my mother and i know my father couldnt stand her thats why my husband left

4331200 estamos pronosticando en 2009 entre 2 7 y 2 8
4331201 this may be normal for most people but for me its a most unusual day
4331202 i dont want to restrict my market because if i do ill get fewer sales

4331209 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs
4331210 china india malaysia are not doing it and neither are canada and the european union
4331211 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4331212 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4331213 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4331214 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4331215 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4331216 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4331217 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4331218 theres some confusion and we havent decided that yet but the point of it is that weve been negotiating for months and its time to put up the product of those negotiations and if they fail republicans can come up with their stuff
4331219 whatever they want to bring to the floor so that we can vote no to taxes and move these negotiations forward so we can get done is fine with me
4331220 i hope that will engage us in the process and help democrats and the governor realize that were not going to support a tax increase
4331221 believes what the democrats put on the floor should have bipartisan support hell continue to push for that compromise until we get a budget
4331222 it is critical that we take action before monday because the democrats have taken budget reform very seriously
4331223 what do we care about going to the ballot for a phony rainy day fund its nothing republicans would vote on
4331224 oil came down but who knows where it will go next
4331225 its in a bit of a holding pattern at the moment she said

4331232 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4331233 shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4331234 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4331235 todo o debate sobre a abrang ncia da lei de anistia bem vindo mas acreditamos que ele est fora de foco n o h menor necessidade de revis o da legisla o e perfeitamente poss vel se buscar essa responsabiliza o com arcabou o jur dico que temos hoje
4331236 a lei de anistia dirigida aos militantes pol ticos essa interpreta o de que ela tamb m serviria aos militares apenas uma interpreta o e n o h necessidade de nenhuma revis o
4331237 o trabalho de investiga o criminal precisa ter muita seguran a com rela o autoria ou seja o mpf s pode processar quando tem elementos fortes veementes de que h uma autoria identificada
4331238 em alguns casos isso j est bastante claro bastante delimitado porque houve ou investiga es por parte do pr prio ex rcito ou uma a o civil pr via que identificou esses autores il citos e outros casos n o n s temos poucas not cias e a indispens vel a abertura dos arquivos
4331239 a discuss o sobre a revis o da lei da anistia repercutiu mal como um ato de revanchismo do ministro tarso n o vejo o governo lula do presidente luiz in cio lula da silva envolvido nisso

4331248 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool today the ned is a neocon controlled agent for us world hegemony its main function is to pour us money and election rigging into former constituent parts of the soviet union in order to ring russia with american puppet states
4331249 the neoconservative bush regime used the ned to intervene in ukrainian and georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neoconservative plan to establish us friendly and russia hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of russia and the soviet union
4331250 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
4331251 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy they had chosen the german pattern in which the major political parties in germany have foundations financed by the federal government they did more or less the same thing with the establishment of the ned as a private foundation there is really nothing private about it and all its money comes from the congress
4331252 a lot of what we ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4331253 whatever comes of all that ill continue to have peace
4331254 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose
4331255 but i discipline my body and keep it under control lest after preaching to others i myself should be disqualified
4331256 none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one
4331257 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it
4331258 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it
4331259 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
4331260 i love the lord because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy because he inclined his ear to me therefore i will call on him as long as i live
4331261 if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
4331262 see what kind of love the father has given to us that we should be called children of god and so we are the reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him beloved we are gods children now and what we will be has not yet appeared but we know that when he appears we will be like him because we shall see him as he is
4331263 in this is love not that we have loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation satisfaction for our sins
4331264 a child does not have the right to use the mothers body without her consent
4331265 that a woman may control her own body and control who uses it
4331266 perilously close to religious persecution in fact close to how hitler behaved towards the jews
4331267 treating an individual based upon the characteristics of other members of the individuals group seems to be the very definition of prejudice
4331268 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
4331269 i believe that god is sovereign over all things but when it comes to election god has chosen to allow man the free will to choose or reject christ
4331270 truly truly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
4331271 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us in christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him in love he predestined us for adoption as sons through jesus christ according to the purpose of his will to the praise of his glorious grace with which he has blessed us in the beloved

4331273 religion is an attempt to get control over the sensory world in which we are placed by means of the wish world which we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological necessities
4331274 for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
4331275 i recognized that i was a sinner and destined for hell so i asked jesus to come into my heart
4331276 did you work all night to come up with that
4331277 was that responsive to my question can you even remember my question no you just threw that in there gratuitously
4331278 perhaps well leave it up to the judge to determine if that was responsive
4331279 i suggest to you that you never sent it up to myron and you have no idea what happened with the schedule
4331280 gord and maria would not deal with it and he moved it up to myron
4331281 other than the fact i send the schedule upstairs that was the extent of my knowledge of how it got dealt with
4331282 i suggest to you that you quite wrongly suggested that mr gottlieb had anything to do with the explanation to the auditors it was out of his scope
4331283 f amp d scene was a related party which should have further sensitized the auditors skepticism
4331284 it should have been a relatively simple matter to request copies of these invoices from f amp d scene or examine evidence of payment
4331285 to think hed have anything to do with q2 as executive vice president of canadian operations was brain dead
4331286 i suggest to you it was a pep talk and thats exactly what it was it was a discussion to encourage you that youd never be fired and you had a place at livent
4331287 how do you structure a church so it just keeps on growing and doesnt plateau i believe there are 10 essentials you must focus on as you structure your church
4331288 you must change the primary role of the pastor from minister to leader
4331289 you can grow a church to 300 with pastoral skills or ministry skills but for it to grow beyond 300 will require leadership skills as a leader you must learn to communicate your vision in very personal and practical ways you must also learn to motivate your church through your messages and understand that its easier to motivate a group than it is to motivate individuals
4331290 a leader also equips others for ministry otherwise youll burn out and the church wont grow an expanding ministry also demands you learn how to raise money those who write the agenda must underwrite the agenda and you must learn to manage your time effective leaders know where their time goes
4331291 if tomorrow president mikhail saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4331292 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4331293 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4331294 we would hope that he would be true to his word
4331295 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4331296 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4331297 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4331298 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4331299 the horror of death is the horror of dying with unlived lives in our bodies
4331300 but in the finite world there is much that is not possible
4331301 i believe nevertheless that i shall get her by virtue that is of the absurd by virtue of the fact that for god all things are possible
4331302 boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past
4331303 the belief that there is something to overcome points you upstream
4331304 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4331305 i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4331306 you defended your land and justice was on your side

4331315 kalau pabrik ini dibiarkan terus beroperasi kami yakin korban berikutnya akan berjatuhan

4331341 military showers of appreciation assists active duty military families from all branches that are expecting new babies with various items they will need to care for their new baby
4331342 because many of these pregnant mothers have babies alone with new fathers deployed we pay special attention to pampering these spouses and supporting them positively during this time
4331343 this shower shed a little sunlight on a difficult time that many military spouses experience during constant deployments
4331344 many people do not realize the sacrifices the entire military family makes during a deployment it is important to the north star group that military families know they are appreciated and that they are not alone
4331345 everything from baby bottles to a bassinet the gifts helped us out a lot the entire event was just a very supportive caring atmosphere i really enjoyed it the baby shower also provided me an opportunity to meet and make new friends with other pregnant military moms
4331346 we will make every attempt to do something special for expecting families even if they miss the shower cut off dates
4331347 these quarterly showers are currently held at camp pendleton and twentynine palms california base locations with plans of expanding to bases in other states in the future all military servicemembers in california willing to travel to the shower from any military bases in the area are welcome to apply

4331407 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4331408 the course design that i came up with this and the entire site that we have available to us here compares very favorably to some the other very notable grand prix events in north america like long beach and toronto
4331409 goes hand in hand with the wyndham championship thats taking today weve got mack trucks coming in today and then an announcement like this its going to happen
4331410 im so angry so mad and have so much hurt in my heart
4331411 you cant tell me this person doesnt know right from wrong
4331412 its all because of a number you deem him mentally retarded i deem him one of satans angels
4331413 she always calls in if shes not going to come
4331414 what were trying to do tonight as part of this first meeting is hear about all of those and start to incorporate those into the process
4331415 wed like to see something that is organized and controlled
4331416 you want to sort of preserve and protect the ones that you love
4331417 it has a lot of commerce commercial activities businesses and residential all along it but some of its successes can also lead to challenges and opportunities
4331418 but as dull as her zoyas lesson had been i was struck with its success her students like all of the students i had borrowed had been taught to retell to repeat and to regurgitate their texts i burst upon their lives however with my flamboyant antics tempting them to speak their minds in english as i watch zoya plod through her lesson i suddenly realized that their capacity to speak had come from hundreds of days of such retelling repeating and regurgitating my success with soviet students had come from the spadework of my colleagues i began to doubt that my teaching in a soviet school would suffice in the long run
4331419 zoya encouraged me to invite her students to express their own ideas in these classrooms and others like them inquiry replaced prompting as students and teachers strived together to learn but the majority of lessons teachers and students stood outside the material as prompting and cheating were essential for survival when i had the opportunity to speak with more than 100 teachers of english and department heads at an in service workshop at school 169 i invited them to step off this train and to listen more to their students ideas and opinions in their classrooms
4331420 sometimes however i wondered if the students only saw me as a celebrity who dropped in whenever he was in town
4331421 that with political information class once a week students develop the habit of hearing someone tell them what the news is rather than finding it out for themselves it is the same when they let you as their class teacher entertain them rather than entertaining themselves your culture is like that people do a lot of taking care of people including taking care of their minds choosing which literature to read which music to listen to and which films to see people expect the government to do these things its as if they are living on a cushion
4331422 on a soft cushion whether it is the cushion of stagnation or the cushion of perestroika it is still a soft cushion
4331423 political information lessons are symbolic of a schools role as a dispenser of information information that comes from above without question this process occurs every day at each lesson in every classroom as teachers pass on the curriculum that has been developed produced and directed from the success of this process depends upon the best students who absorb and regurgitate the information and help their friends along the way and the better the help the greater the success for everybody
4331424 this is the awful thing that we still have all the old methods we want the new thinking but we have the old thinking and the old methods there is a very bad need for learning and now when an organ of man is not used it atrophies and this has happened to the brain when everybody says what you must do next your brain doesnt work when suddenly you have to decide for yourself we are so used to doing things as we are told we need to start putting our brains to work but it is very very hard for the teachers not because we are afraid or pessimistic but because we do not have enough information not enough knowledge we dont know
4331425 they had expressed their envy of the elaborate facilities and abundance of materials in american high schools as well as their admiration of the system of choices in the secondary school curriculum want to make learning enjoyable
4331426 these american students select easy subjects and the teachers dont challenge them yet the age of 13 14 15 all these years are good for developing their brains four subjects with very little homework is not enough the students do not have enough food to develop their brains
4331427 its all right to say exactly what you think if you have learned to think exactly

4331431 i wish i could have gone nine innings but i was pretty tired out there its a good team marlins and i kept the ball down on them so its what i had to do
4331432 its definitely frustrating when we cant find the big hit that we need
4331433 unfortunately thats baseball youve just got to keep pushing and keep going the season doesnt end tomorrow so weve got to go out there and try to win this next series against the cubs
4331434 no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather to reprove them
4331435 whether he eats or drinks or whatever he does to do all to the glory of god
4331436 plays raise the passions and pervert the use of them and of consequence are dangerous to morality
4331437 that the seeing of comedies ought to be forbidden to young people such indulgences not being safe until age and discipline have confirmed them in sobriety fortified their virtue and made them proof against debauchery
4331438 unlawful to go to comedies tragedies interludes farces or other stage plays acted in public or private because in all ages these have been forbidden among christians as bringing in a corruption of good manners
4331439 a recreation which ought not to be allowed among a civilized people much less a christian people
4331440 nothing had done more to debauch the age in which he lived than the theater and the playhouse
4331441 will you obey god or man will you timidly or basely give way to that which you must acknowledge to be wicked or will you dare to do what is right though all the world were against you will you take the scriptures or the maxims of a corrupt world for your guide
4331442 madam there is one pleasure growing out of the theater which you have omitted to mention
4331443 i refer to the pleasure which the remembrance of having attended on the theater will give you on a dying bed
4331444 the heavens and the earth passing away that there shall be no place found for them
4331445 many great men and rich men and mighty men hiding themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains saying to the mountains and rocks fall upon us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand
4331446 the white population is older and very much centred around the ageing baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years

4331453 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4331454 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4331455 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4331456 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4331457 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4331474 the u s says these elections are essential to get iraqis who have taken risks and stopped fighting into the political system
4331475 well what happens if the political system is rigged against those people i think some of those people might return to violence
4331476 the governing parties have lost their popular base and they dont want these elections because theyre going to lose
4331477 if there is any fraud in the next elections iraq will be a mess again
4331478 this time we will use force to take control of things

4331483 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4331484 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4331485 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4331486 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4331487 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4331488 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4331489 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4331490 we got him in to the hut and got him comfortable but i think it happened pretty fast
4331491 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4331492 deep concern over the deteriorating situation in indian occupied kashmir
4331493 oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus standi
4331494 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4331495 we have geared up resources and will have anti air attack systems in place in the capital some areas have been declared no fly zones
4331496 we appeal to people to observe august 15 as a black day and stay away from indian functions
4331497 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works
4331498 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4331499 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4331500 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4331501 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4331502 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4331503 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4331504 there are no conditions obviously what is missing is that the waiver is void if there is another atomic test
4331505 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number

4331509 on friday at the opening ceremony i will experience something astonishing i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe its happened because a lot of athletes identify with me
4331510 i loved my sport from the moment i played my first game and i still enjoy training
4331511 warner bros is very happy and they sent me a bottle of champagne last week
4331512 we believe that no country in the entire world stands to gain as much economic benefit from diversity as canada
4331513 if we succeed we will have an unrivalled advantage but the flip side is also true if we fail we will pay a heavy cost in lost opportunity
4331514 we believe that canada must target future workforce challenges not only by raising immigration targets in key sectors but also by making a concerted effort to release the untapped potential in our current workforce
4331515 its no secret that we dont have the best track record in this area
4331516 our most recent immigrants arrive in canada better educated and at similar stages in their careers as those born in canada but evidence suggests that they have not found jobs that match their skill levels are earning less than those born in canada or are experiencing higher unemployment rates this represents a direct hit to our economy
4331517 confuse the dreary recitation of politically correct gibberish with sensitivity that they think they have arrived at through their own value clarification

4331520 you cant drive the car because i paid for the gas thats in it
4331521 stay out of my room and dont touch my stuff
4331522 there are never any snacks because he eats them all in one day
4331523 situations like this are expected there are no penalties etc
4331524 ha ha ha now see if you can re mortgage your house
4331525 wait a minute this money lending businesses have been operating in such a wimpy manner for so long its time to show them what the loan sharking business is all about
4331526 hmm what is the most natural consequence in money lending transactions
4331527 hmmmm even though they are stupid they are smart enough to understand simple arithmetic like
4331528 we didnt know if they would react to the western style music we play if not what do you use
4331529 chinese music is just not so rocky and poppy we need people up there stamping their feet if theyre sitting down and swaying gently its not so great
4331530 recruiting and retaining a stable and skilled work force is becoming increasingly difficult
4331531 the survey makes it clear housing is a key factor in stabilizing and sustaining that work force
4331532 farmworker housing has been such a huge issue for so long
4331533 i just feel its important that something better is developed period
4331534 the need its huge as far as quantifying the need its like trying to hit a moving target
4331535 both the state and the industry are working together to try to meet the need
4331536 the truth is that the workers are supporting our economy and just like everybody else they deserve a place to sleep at night
4331537 give some breaks to farmers to house these folks onsite
4331538 our priority in the farm bureau is the migrant worker
4331539 i think it would move to the area of jeopardizing health and safety
4331540 i am your brother joseph whom you sold into egypt and now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here for god sent me before you to preserve life so it was not you who sent me here but god
4331541 fountain i know that you are pi ed off but i was just with the battalion commander and up on the map this thing is beautiful
4331542 i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
4331543 it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
4331544 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
4331545 woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish
4331546 cost effective high performance energy storage has been the missing link for renewable energy
4331547 the smart storage technology is based on csiros ultrabattery which has been successfully trialled in hybrid vehicles
4331548 most importantly our technology development path is directed towards manufacturing in existing lead acid battery plants
4331549 too often new technologies simply arent affordable and that significantly retards market uptake
4331550 investments in energy storage technologies have excellent potential for strong returns given the growing market demand and the lack of viable solutions we now have investments in two energy storage technology companies v fuel which targets grid scale renewable energy storage applications and now smart storage for smaller renewable energy systems
4331551 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the failed policies and old politics that john mccain wants to continue the focus of our convention to people back here in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4331552 a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4331553 its not even a settled issue legally whether or not he will be able to go
4331554 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4331555 i wish i could have pitched a little better in front of my family and friends the houston native said
4331556 i would have liked to do both but nothing would make me pass up my first big league shot said espineli who had a 5 40 era in nine games
4331557 ive never had anything like that before said rowand who felt the twinge while stretching
4331558 i wanted to pitch longer but they wanted to err on the side of caution

4331560 hey but at least you only have to wait a year for part one of deathly hallows
4331561 just a few years ago only a celebrity chef could have stirred up so much epicurean excitement
4331562 in the past people would call me and ask where can i pick apples where can i pick pumpkins
4331563 the thought of a farm being our farm is new
4331564 amy is a legend people meet her and they swoon
4331565 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered
4331566 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
4331567 women will take certain pieces theyre familiar with and work it into their wardrobe
4331568 theres a niche customer for that so we do cater to her
4331569 we have a few styles that we offer in long sleeves
4331570 customers will say im having a religious wedding what can you do to these dresses to fit my standards
4331571 engaged in the business of discovering and developing artists in the music industry
4331572 im saying to myself hey its ok records are made to be broken including mine
4331573 rooted and built up in him strengthened in the faith
4331574 i need to look out for no 1 here so please amuse yourself while i concentrate on this man im auditioning
4331575 we are seeing so many of our guests coming in that are having trouble sleeping at night
4331576 this is a way for us to really extend an opportunity for them to have total relaxation
4331577 you can split your sleep up and still have the same aggregate effect
4331578 if you try to take a nap and its too long you wake up super groggy
4331579 that is not a good thing for anyone who needs to work immediately they really havent made themselves feel better
4331580 but since i am neither a camera nor much given to writing pieces which do not interest me whatever i write reflects sometimes gratuitously how i feel
4331581 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
4331582 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
4331583 cold blooded murder just isnt thomas langs cup of tea offered a bundle to assassinate an american industrialist he opts to warn the intended victim instead a good deed that soon takes a bad turn quicker than he can down a shot of his favorite whiskey lang is bashing heads with a buddha statue matching wits with evil billionaires and putting his life among other things in the hands of a bevy of femme fatales up against rogue cia agents wannabe terrorists and an arms dealer looking to make a high tech killing langs out to save the leggy lady he has come to love and prevent an international bloodbath to boot
4331584 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4331585 i think too often the effort to find the answers only distracts us from what is really to be found there
4331586 so odd so out of the normal flow of things
4331587 it makes me furious to think of it it makes me furious to think of our claim of canada as a classless society
4331588 there now exists a national stereotype of the western literary arts which i occasionally see or hear being criticized by usually young central canadian critics and writers in it we are seen as writing sentimentally only about the farm about the past about our legendary hard life and our endurance of it this has become so much the stereotype that any western writer approaching that world in an attempt to say something new and interesting about it runs the risk of being dismissed without a reading
4331589 thank you god and i just stand there on the boat taking it all in wow what a view
4331590 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4331591 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4331592 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4331593 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4331594 if i may be so bold there was another president
4331595 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4331596 canadian health care we so envy lies in ruins its architect admits
4331597 doctors should not get rich off their patients period end of story society has greatly subsidized every doctors education if a doctor wants to supplement his or her income with cosmetic procedures this should be strictly evenings and weekends
4331598 why on earth should a 10 minute botox injection be worth 500
4331599 clinics will not take patients without referrals and unless a matter is urgent it can take 4 5 months to get an appointment which they keep as short as possible however if a patient wants a cosmetic procedure it takes only 1 2 weeks for an appointment the dermatology profession needs to examine its ethics or the lack thereof
4331600 the rest of the medical system will follow once health care becomes a one payer system there will be a second tier for the moneyed this is how medicine works in europe
4331601 this is a perfect example of market forces at work and proof the market works perfectly money talks in this case however market forces pervert the delivery of good health care the solution is to reimburse doctors for actually taking care of patients not doing procedures or ordering expensive tests with a regime change in washington on the horizon we will hopefully have a complete overhaul of our decrepit and wasteful health care industrial complex
4331602 the idea that patients with potential skin cancer have to literally beg to be seen by a doctor is absolutely horrifying
4331603 any doctor who will not see a patient who suspects a mole cancerous or has a chronic skin disease for longer than 72 hours should be sued and forced to explain his negligence in a court of law
4331604 they quote an 80 recurrence free 10 year survival rate for stage iia and 75 for stage iib im stage iia and my onc says i am probably cured after surgery chemo etc do you really think all node positive younger women are destined to recur another question how do you compare positive nodes with lympho vascular invasion my onc says that there is no data that lvi is as negative an indicator as nodes
4331605 breast cancer progresses from local gt regional gt systemic disease and the
4331606 breast cancer is already systemic at the time of most diagnosis
4331607 with a tiny bit of cancer debate on how to proceed
4331608 what makes the 2007 toyota camry motor trends car of the year who decides who should be ranked number 1 in college football which tastes better coke or pepsi more importantly is your hospital any good and are you any good ask patients to weigh in on their surgical experience or hospital care and you might be surprised to find out what they want free parking or what they dont care about board certification
4331609 funcom can confirm that some of the female models in the game have had the size of their breasts changed this is due to an unintended change in data that was introduced in an earlier patch data which controls the so called morph values associated with character models and the size of their respective body parts we are working on a fix for this and your breasts should be back to normal soon the plastic surgeons of hyboria apologize for the inconvenience
4331610 it must be a good time to be a bond holder or reconstructive surgeon in this instance
4331611 i need some fine wine and you you need to be nicer
4331612 weve proven this approach works weve seen the impact on patient care and on outcome less pain quicker recovery improved cosmetics
4331613 when i was applying to programs last year and traversing the country visiting programs there were a few trends which enticed applicants probably none more that microvascular breast reconstruction i was curious whether you think this trend will persist or do you think increased insurance skepticism and comparability of implant based reconstruction and rotational flap reconstruction will leave this procedure for the uber rich willing to pay the difference
4331614 does this type of reconstruction look more like a breast
4331615 if you think youve invented some new operation in plastic surgery you probably havent looked in german surgery journals from the 1920s
4331616 what are the things we do that really cause long term problems and how can i avoid that
4331617 take hisn and beat yourn and then take yourn and beat hisn
4331618 a tela estava dividida de um lado datena e de outro a entrevista com o delegado datena comentava a entrevista

4331620 these would be the final words i would hear from the one that always stood by me
4331621 we were never a burden to anyone we never took charity and we were not split up to be sent to different homes
4331622 personally i owe a debt of gratitude to these courageous workers for braving the elements and presenting the gospel to the porter family what a heritage
4331623 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4331624 both countries should pledge not to interfere in each others domestic affairs
4331625 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4331626 i hope no one will try to obstruct these endeavors
4331627 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4331628 both countries should pledge not to interfere in each others domestic affairs
4331629 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4331630 i hope no one will try to obstruct these endeavors
4331631 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4331632 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4331633 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4331634 they allow this horrible terrorist who murdered my daughter and all these other people to triumph this is a triumph for terrorism
4331635 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4331636 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4331637 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4331638 they allow this horrible terrorist who murdered my daughter and all these other people to triumph this is a triumph for terrorism
4331639 all this does it says we swept the families away we pretend that gadhafi never blew up an american plane
4331640 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4331641 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4331642 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4331643 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4331646 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4331647 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4331648 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4331649 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4331650 whatevers in the refrigerator is what gets put in the tank
4331651 instead of portioning the chips out of the sack and then putting the sack clear in the other room thats one of the things he has a little problem with
4331652 its either curl up in the corner and cry or keep it light and try to get through it
4331653 i could be pretty upset pretty easily but why should i be everything would get worse my health would start going downhill theres no profit in it
4331654 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4331655 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4331656 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4331657 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4331658 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4331659 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4331660 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4331661 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4331662 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
4331663 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
4331664 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
4331665 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
4331666 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
4331667 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
4331668 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
4331669 if we can understand how and why those nerve signals are able to get through it could provide insight into those basic pathways in humans
4331670 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
4331671 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
4331672 the family considers cash to be jakes hero because without her we probably would not have had a body to bring home
4331673 as weeks went by we hoped hed walk back in one day like hed been on vacation or something
4331674 having cash now is like having him with us it is the silver lining
4331675 cash had to have found a water source somewhere the morning dew off of the grass or maybe she found a puddle somewhere
4331676 she might have even resorted to eating small rodents for water
4331677 it sounds like such a strong bond that this dog will kill or die so to speak for this owner
4331678 dogs are extremely loyal to humans i dont think there is any other creature on the planet that is as loyal
4331679 jake was trying to be brave for everyone and not show he had been losing his ground
4331680 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4331681 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4331682 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4331683 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4331684 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4331685 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4331686 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population

4331697 we still have a lot of fridays and youve got to use that
4331698 did not think it possible for a government to show so much contempt
4331699 but beyond our own survival this decision makes no sense on many levels at a time when canadian culture is extremely dynamic and is in demand all over the world this decision kills the cultural carte de visite for our embassies which need culture to lobby and to do business

4331741 whatever the lord pleases he does in heaven and in earth in the seas and in all deeps
4331742 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things which have not been done saying my purpose will be established and
4331743 behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is anything too difficult for me
4331744 and all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing but he does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth and no one can ward off his hand or say to him what hast thou done
4331745 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
4331746 the lot is cast into the lap but its every decision is from the lord
4331747 in order that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous
4331748 look at the birds of the air that they do not sow neither do they reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not worth much more than they
4331749 but if god so arrays the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will he not much more do so for you o men of little faith
4331750 and he made from one every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth
4331751 o clap your hands all peoples shout to god with the voice of joy 2 for the lord most high is to be feared a great king over all the earth 3 he subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet 4 hchooses our inheritance for us the glory of jacob whom he loves
4331752 the lord nullifies the counsel of the nations he frustrates the plans of the peoples
4331753 and adam had relations with his wife again and she gave birth to a son and named him seth for she said
4331754 your fathers went down to egypt seventy persons in all and now the lord your god has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven
4331755 so boaz took ruth and she became his wife and he went in to her and the lord enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son
4331756 he who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death
4331757 but if he did not lie in wait for him but god let him fall into his hand then i will appoint you a place to which he may flee
4331758 if the lord wills we shall live and also do this or that
4331759 who is there who speaks and it comes to pass unless the lord has commanded it 38 is it not from the mouth of the most high that both good and ill go forth
4331760 see now that i i am he and there is no god besides me it is i who put to death and give life i have wounded and it is i who heal and there is no one who can deliver from my hand
4331761 the lord kills and makes alive he brings down to sheol and raises up 7 the lord makes poor and rich he brings low he also exalts
4331762 consider the work of god for who is able to straighten what he has bent 14 in the day of prosperity be happy but in the day of adversity consider god has made the one as well as the other so that man may not discover anything that will be after him
4331763 i am the lord and there is no other besides me there is no god i will gird you though you have not known me 6 that men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun that there is no one besides me i am the lord and there is no other 7 the one forming light and creating darkness causing well being and creating calamity i am the lord who does all these
4331764 who is there who speaks and it comes to pass unless the lord has commanded it 38 is it not from the mouth of the most high that both good and ill go forth
4331765 if a trumpet is blown in a city will not the people tremble if a calamity occurs in a city has not the lord done it
4331766 this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior 4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
4331767 the lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness but is patient toward you
4331768 and the master said to the slave go out into the highways and along the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled
4331769 just as it is written god gave them a spirit of stupor eyes to see not and ears to hear not down to this very day
4331770 so then he has mercy on whom he desires and he hardens whom he desires
4331771 and the lord said to moses when you go back to egypt see that you perform before pharaoh all the wonders which i have put in your power but
4331772 but pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the people go
4331773 and as for me behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians so that they will go in after them and i will be honored through pharaoh and all his army through his chariots and his horsemen
4331774 but sihon king of heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land for
4331775 but amaziah would not listen for it was from god that he might deliver them into the hand of joash because they had sought the gods of edom
4331776 render the hearts of this people insensitive their ears dull and their eyes dim lest they see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and return and be healed
4331777 so then he has mercy on whom he desires and he hardens whom he desires
4331778 the heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick who can understand it
4331779 for from within out of the heart of men proceed the evil thoughts fornications thefts murders adulteries
4331780 all these evil things proceed from within and defile the man
4331781 and this is the judgment that the light is come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil
4331782 truly truly i say to you everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin
4331783 for while we were still helpless at the right time christ died for the ungodly
4331784 for when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness
4331785 for i know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh for the wishing is present in me but the doing of the good is not
4331786 but i see a different law in the members of my body waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members
4331787 but a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised
4331788 which things we also speak not in words taught by human wisdom but in those taught by the spirit combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words 14 but a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised
4331789 among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others
4331790 realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous man but for those who are lawless and rebellious for the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for those who kill their fathers or mothers for murderers
4331791 i call heaven and earth to witness against you today that i have set before you life and death the blessing and the curse so choose life in order that you may live you and your descendants
4331792 and if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the lord choose for yourselves today whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the river or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
4331793 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name 13 who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
4331794 and when the gentiles heard this they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the lord and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed
4331795 he predestined us to adoption as sons through jesus christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will
4331796 also we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according to his purpose who works all things after the counsel of his will
4331797 to predetermine decide beforehand in the nt of god decreeing from eternity to foreordain appoint beforehand
4331798 to predetermine or foreordain to appoint or ordain beforehand by an unchangeable purpose
4331799 for to you it has been granted for christs sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake
4331800 for god has not destined us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our lord jesus christ
4331801 to set put place to make to set fix establish
4331802 but we should always give thanks to god for you brethren beloved by the lord because god has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and faith in the truth 14 and it was for this he called you through our gospel that you may gain the glory of our lord jesus christ
4331803 but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep
4331804 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me john 10 11
4331805 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up on the last day
4331806 and a certain woman named lydia from the city of thyatira a seller of purple fabrics a worshiper of god was listening and
4331807 for through the grace given to me i say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think but to think so as to have sound judgment as
4331808 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
4331809 in the exercise of his will he brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be as it were the first fruits among his creatures
4331810 to predetermine decide beforehand in the nt of god decreeing from eternity to foreordain appoint beforehand
4331811 which the nt uses only with god as subject expresses the thought of appointing a situation for a person or a person for a situation
4331812 to predetermine or foreordain to appoint or ordain beforehand by an unchangeable purpose
4331813 for truly in this city there were gathered together against thy holy servant jesus whom thou didst anoint both herod and pontius pilate along with the gentiles and the peoples of israel
4331814 for whom he foreknew he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren 30 and whom he predestined these he also called and whom he called these he also justified and whom he justified these he also glorified
4331815 yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature a wisdom however not of this age nor of the rulers of this age who are passing away
4331816 just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him in love 5 he predestined us to adoption as sons through jesus christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will
4331817 also we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according to his purpose who works all things after the counsel of his will
4331818 for many are called kletos but few are chosen eklektos
4331819 for false christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to mislead if possible even the elect eklektos
4331820 and he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet and they will gather together his elect eklektos from the four winds from one end of the sky to the other
4331821 now shall not god bring about justice for his elect eklektos who cry to him day and night and will he delay long over them
4331822 greet rufus a choice eklektos man in the lord also his mother and mine
4331823 i solemnly charge you in the presence of god and of christ jesus and of his chosen eklektos angels to maintain these principles without bias doing nothing in a spirit of partiality
4331824 the elder to the chosen eklektos lady and her children whom i love in truth and not only i but also all who know the truth
4331825 and the lord said to moses when you go back to egypt see that you perform before pharaoh all the wonders which i have put in your power but
4331826 but pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the people go
4331827 and as for me behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians so that they will go in after them and i will be honored through pharaoh and all his army through his chariots and his horsemen
4331828 but sihon king of heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land for
4331829 but amaziah would not listen for it was from god that he might deliver them into the hand of joash because they had sought the gods of edom
4331830 render the hearts of this people insensitive their ears dull and their eyes dim lest they see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and return and be healed
4331831 so then he has mercy on whom he desires and he hardens whom he desires
4331832 yet to this day the lord has not given you a heart to know nor eyes to see nor ears to hear
4331833 and i will give them a heart to know me for i am the lord and they will be my people and i will be their god for they will return to me with their whole heart
4331834 i know o lord that a mans way is not in himself
4331835 now therefore it was not you who sent me here but god and he has made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of egypt
4331836 then it happened when he turned his back to leave samuel god changed his heart and all those signs came about on that day
4331837 the kings heart is like channels of water in the hand of the lord he turns it wherever he wishes
4331838 and he caused his people to be very fruitful and made them stronger than their adversaries
4331839 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name 13 who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
4331840 now god granted daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials
4331841 for god has put it in their hearts to execute his purpose by having a common purpose and by giving their kingdom to the beast until the words of god should be fulfilled
4331842 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
4331843 the lord has made everything for its own purpose even the wicked for the day of evil
4331844 what if god although willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction 23 and he did so in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy which he prepared beforehand for glory
4331845 this man delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of god you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death
4331846 peter an apostle of jesus christ to those who reside as aliens scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia who are chosen 2 according to the foreknowledge of god the father by the sanctifying work of the spirit that you may obey jesus christ and be sprinkled with his blood may grace and peace be yours in fullest measure
4331847 for he christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you
4331848 if god looked into the future to see what choice would be made then who did he foreknow the death of christ was it simply something that god looked to see if it would happen or not if so then god is not sovereign then isnt he predestining us because he is seeing in us something that is motivating him to save us if our faith motivates god to save us then it must have some merit in gods eyes otherwise it would not motivate god to save us
4331849 god does not intend to bring about everything he values but he never fails to bring about what he intends
4331850 heh miss gosip punya gosip baru buat kita kita nggak
4331851 cella sayang kok cemberut gitu sih nih mama udah buatin kamu sop ayam
4331852 lets cut our losses spend the day getting cleaned up and getting things back in order and well start fresh tomorrow

4331868 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4331869 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4331870 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4331871 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4331872 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4331873 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4331874 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4331875 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4331876 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4331877 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4331878 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4331879 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4331880 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4331881 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4331882 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4331883 a may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4331884 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4331885 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4331886 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues
4331887 there is reason to believe that wal mart stores inc has made prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against senator obamas election to employees

4331890 if the local resistance is already so weakened that the inflammatory focus no longer can become encapsulated the inflammatory toxins will infiltrate without hindrance into the pulpa and the whole organism if an inflammatory process can no longer be localised and encapsulated it proves as emphasised by pischinger and kellner that the organism has become largely non reactive on an x ray these teeth normally show no translucence this is characterised as x ray negative in our cancer patients such non encapsulated focus and therefore x ray negative teeth do frequently exist this indicates the enormity of low resistance of these patients
4331891 thirty two canals in four mongrel dogs were treated endodontically the mandibular third and fourth premolars were selected for study because their apices were widely spaced and could be studied individually without danger of confusion
4331892 examination of the histologic sections revealed that in some cases root canal instrumentation had been terminated slightly short of the anatomic apex moreover some canals which appeared reontgenographically to be filled slightly short of the apex actually were associated with extrusion of some particles of sealer into the periodontal ligament space
4331893 in the canals which were overfilled the extruded materials were always associated with advanced destruction of the surrounding tissue and liquification necrosis
4331894 all root canals in the effected tooth must be treated
4331895 altmann doepke and pritz as well as fischer hess and other researchers have become involved with the fine structure of the tooth
4331896 in the case of an acutely infected tooth there is no natural process of drainage and there is no mechanism by which the antibiotics which have been administered can reach the bacteria inside the tooth
4331897 it is now known that complete sterilization of an infected root canal is very difficult to achieve and complete removal of all pulp tissue remnants frequently is not possible
4331898 only 5 of those bacteria could grow in air strict anaerobic bacteria must have played a decisive pathological role although a limited number of facultative species have been show to induce periapical lesions
4331899 local comfort may constitute both what is probably one of the greatest paradoxes and one of the costliest diagnostic mistakes through injury to health that exists in dental and medical practice the absence of this local reaction and the consequent destruction by the infection products permits them to pass through the body to irritate and break down that patients most susceptible tissue
4331900 a root canal treatment which does not plant a focus does not exist

4331919 ive been reading what ryan has been saying to the media and i want to say the other side of it hes blaming the driver when i think that there are poor management practices that are actually to blame for the accident
4331920 there were no mechanical problems with a cascadia cabs pedicab involved in a deadly collision with a minivan wednesday in seattle says the owner of the company who blames the driver for the crash
4331921 ryan hashagen of bellingham the companys owner said the brakes of the three wheeled touring vehicle were working properly and that the driver should never have taken the pedicab down such a steep slope
4331922 our heart goes out to all those affected by this incident
4331923 we want to get to the bottom of this situation as much as anyone we are conducting a full investigation into what has occurred we are cooperating with all relevant local authorities investigating this incident

4331933 it would have been cause for concern if there was a connection between the two but as it stands there were no principals from tristate listed as principals at h amp m

4331937 if thou speakest not i will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it i will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience
4331938 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4331939 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4331940 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4331941 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there was people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly

4331949 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4331950 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4331951 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4331952 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4331953 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4331954 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4331955 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4331956 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4331968 i worked my way through harvard and then i helped women at microsoft help other women achieve success
4331969 ive had a number of people come up and hug me which ive never had happen before
4331970 because they feel like they know me that was the point i just wanted to make sure i introduced myself to people who dont know me
4331971 you know i have a name id thats almost 100 percent
4331972 so i dont have to spend money to raise my name id i just need money to get my message out
4331973 the other side spent all of their ad money trying to paint a very distorted picture of who i am
4331974 absolutely we are working very hard to convey to voters who i am and what i care about
4331975 it is unfortunate that many people business executives as well as so called security experts believe that the implementation of one or two security products can address security issues there cannot be a one size fits all approach to security as each environment is different with its own set of vulnerabilities and some security products themselves contain flaws which increase a networks vulnerability rather than reduce it
4331976 indeed if businesses are serious about security they need to understand that the only way to truly check that they are secure is to view the code thats one of the reasons i believe open source software is the better option for companies where security is of the utmost concern its not that open source is more secure but rather the fact that you can view the code see any vulnerabilities yourself and even fix if necessary if you have the skills to do so
4331977 i was a little flat but it got over the line so that is all that matters

4331986 we are very excited with the results of this study and are planning to meet with the u s food and drug administration fda in the fourth quarter of this year to discuss the results of this study and determine the next steps in the submission of a new drug application nda for ipx056
4331987 such spasticity treatments represent a 1 6 billion market in the u s and ipx056 may fill an unmet medical need in these patients
4331988 we are very pleased with the progress we have made in advancing our proprietary brand products and expect to continue this progress with an expansion in our r amp d staff this year the cns space is ideally suited to our core competency in drug delivery as so many products are candidates for improved dosing and administration and the market is large and growing at almost 10 annually faster than the total u s pharmaceutical market in addition the neurology market is readily addressable by a small and focused sales force given the concentration of physicians writing prescriptions we currently have 66 specialty sales representatives to market our products and to serve as a contract force for others
4331989 the result of the heat trial further demonstrates that epzicom is an effective first line option for treatment naive hiv patients with a well established safety profile
4331990 this study provides the first head to head completed study comparing these two hiv treatments and demonstrates comparable results between the two
4331991 glaxosmithkline carefully considers any new information on our medicines and we are working closely with actg to understand why our analyses found conflicting results
4331992 this analysis based on similar criteria to that utilized in actg 5202 demonstrates that epzicom continues to be an effective treatment option for treatment naive patients as always physicians must consider each patients individual health and treatment history when making treatment decisions

4332012 jika kita mahu mengambil tindakan kita perlu melakukan siasatan bukan sewenang wenangnya bertindak perlu meneliti dari segenap aspek
4332013 jika tiada perkara seumpama itu berlaku kita hanya boleh memberi amaran agar mereka mengambil kira pandangan dan sensitiviti agama serta kaum lain
4332014 kita tidak mahu dalam apa juga konflik atau permasalahan islam dianggap sebagai punca sedangkan ia adalah masalah sejagat yang perlu diberi perhatian sama rata oleh semua pihak

4332043 the nanosecond offers new knowledge about the nature of existence all of humanity is challenged to make room for this energy in the physical form this energy does not just effortlessly slide in you must be willing to change by opening your mind to accommodate it
4332044 if the energies encounter a blockage they will begin to concentrate and create pressure in and around the blocked area essentially working to unlock and untangle the snarl that is creating the obstruction
4332045 to live and thrive during these accelerated times you must integrate this energy anything that blocks these energies will become visibly manifest and must be dealt with as an obstacle and moved out of the way so as not to impede the process of your personal transformation

4332065 magang tersebut merupakan bagian dari intrakurikuler agar mereka dapat menyelesaikan studinya mahasiswa harus berinteraksi dengan industri dunia kerja agar tahu situasi kerja yang sebenarnya
4332066 program magang ini pemanasan bagi mahasiswa yang kelak harus siap menjadi orang hutan sesuai dengan gelarnya sarjana perkebunan kelapa sawit
4332067 saya berharap sebagai anak bangsa yang sadar akan nasionalisme para alumni instiper harus mampu berperan dalam pembangunan perkebunan karena itu diperlukan perubahan cara pandang paradigma terhadap perkebunan kehutanan tentunya dengan tidak menggeneralisir masalah masalah pertanian tananam pangan menjadi permasalahan pertanian secara umum masalah impor beras kelangkaan kedelai impor gula dan naiknya harga gandum serta stigma kemiskian yang dilekatkan pada petanian tanaman pangan tentunya tidak selayaknya dipergunakan untuk menilai keragaan produktivitas perkebunan kehutanan
4332068 perkembangan perkebunan dan hti juga mempunyai manfaat global terutama dalam mereduksi gas rumah kaca yang mempunyai kontribusi dalam memperlambat global warming
4332069 hal ini disadari sepenuhnya oleh instiper yang sejak berdiri tahun 1958 memilih perkebunan sebagai core pendidikan tingginya relevansi pendidikan perkebunan menjadi perhatian utama instiper dalam menghasilkan sumber daya manusia yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan dunia kerja perkebunan kehutanan karena itu instiper telah menjalin kerjasama dengan beberapa perusahaan perkebunan kelapa sawit seperti pt astra agro lestari tbk dan pt sinar mas tbk

4332075 terus terang hingga sekarang ini belum ada sarjana perkebunan yang betul betul menguasai kelapa sawit pada kenyataannya jumlah sarjana perkebunan memang masih kurang
4332076 luas lahan perkebunan tersebut masih dalam izin pengelolaan atau izin pembukaan lahan jumlah riilnya baru sekitar 3 5 juta hektare diperkirakan 10 tahun ke depan jumlah ini akan meningkat hingga 5 juta hektare
4332077 sdm planters masih perlu dididik secara khusus dengan menggunakan karakter yang khas untuk memenuhi kebutuhan tersebut instiper yogyakarta membuka program khusus pendidikan spks mereka ini nantinya lulus langsung kerja karena sudah banyak perusahaan yang memesan
4332078 pt astra agro akan terus meningkatkan kerja sama saling menguntungkan dengan dunia pendidikan dengan basis perkebunan ini kerja sama magang dalam skala massal pertama yang akan terus dilanjutkan jika hasilnya bagus
4332079 kami ingin membekali mahasiswa supaya memperoleh keterampilan bekerja di lapangan
4332080 kebutuhan tenaga kerja di perkebunan kelapa sawit semakin besar dalam lima tahun ke depan kami ingin terus ekspansi

4332083 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

4332085 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4332086 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4332087 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4332133 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4332134 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4332135 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4332138 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4332141 i didnt know if todd was going to be having surgery or not having surgery
4332142 i just wanted to explain to him symptoms i had and the rehab i had he just kind of listened and i think it sounded like he was going to consult with dr watkins which i think would be a good thing he didnt really tell me the extent of what he had
4332143 having peace of mind is what you really want to have because anything can set it off
4332144 you can get out of bed wrong you can pick up your kid you can pick up a cup of coffee leaning the wrong way to get it anything
4332145 theres things that can kind of take the edge off the symptoms like cortisone shots and epidurals and things like that
4332146 but obviously if youre looking like four or five years ahead and you still have the same injury
4332147 hopefully he goes and sees watkins and watkins says i believe if you do a lot of these exercises you should be fine but theres no shortcuts
4332148 he has an injured back with a herniation and hes going to have to strengthen it and do exercises so it doesnt come into play i was just trying to give todd a little bit of insight into things he would have to do if he didnt have surgery
4332149 if he does have surgery theres a lot of work ahead of him too but hell have to make that decision because hes the one affected by the injury only he knows how severe and how painful it is
4332150 it not something you want to have during the season because that would be too much down time
4332151 im not heltons doctor and i dont know the extent of it but if surgery was needed theres no better time to have it then getting ready to have it now because its going to take time to recover from it
4332152 i just wanted to give a little bit guidance to todd as funny as that sounds with someone trying to hit a home run off me
4332153 but i think anybody that has back problems i can vouch for them its not a whole lot of fun
4332154 i think its a great victory for nevada civil rights i want to get into a court and take this all the way ive opened the floodgates for complaints
4332155 while this may be true this reason is not persuasive

4332173 designed to not only respond to smears but enlist supporters in reporting smears that are out there so they can be dealt with
4332174 first of all there was the interview which is not an interview at all as i do not believe i asked her a single question let us rather call it a conversation that took place at dead of night without a spotlight or make up a single night time conversation recorded as if by miracle on the magnetic tape of a comer that would then become the very heart of this film
4332175 our position is those are false malicious allegations that have hurt him in his trade especially being a man of the cloth

4332186 we chose to stay in canada because it was a better place to be for bent and easier to do our training with him
4332187 we talk about treatment this is what he has to get done and we plan around it we want to do whatevers best for him bents perspective is that it keeps his mind doing something else
4332188 it depends on the cycle he can be quite nauseous he also gets symptomatic treatment and we try to conserve his strength
4332189 bent is a great internal motivator for us to do things better
4332190 bents philosophy is based around giving 100 per cent of your focus to rowing but that sometimes you take your head away from it and focus on other things too
4332191 we may not have him standing there so we want to get it right

4332202 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4332203 it would be the wrong thing to do by anybodys definition i think senator clinton should be honored but i think that it would absolutely the wrong thing to do and i think she should discourage her supporters from doing that
4332204 we are absolutely committed to electing barack obama and this is the best way to do it so let people have their moment
4332205 sen clinton will assure that nothing will occur that will hinder sen obama s chances but even more will help him by when it comes time for her vote by voting for him and by moving at the convention to nominate sen obama by acclamation
4332206 the dread of being at close quarters with homosexuals the revulsion toward homosexuals and often the desire to inflict punishment as retribution

4332209 childhood obesity has become so severe that diseases that once affected only adults are now appearing in children
4332210 the long term implications of this epidemic are extremely serious obese children are much more likely than children of healthy weight to become obese adults
4332211 a four stage approach to treatment of childhood obesity is recommended
4332212 many of these recommendations can be carried out by family physicians for treatment and prevention

4332219 but as has been the case with this bear he simply made another wrong turn
4332220 worst case scenario you have the bear struck on an eight lane highway injured and in close proximity to humans
4332221 thats just a situation likely to end with a bad outcome
4332222 that bears been through a real ordeal the last few weeks wed hate for people to get out and look to bother it

4332234 i preemptively conceded vivacious to obama on the last thread no doubt obama is a winner on every issue that matters to democrats is he going to win the good to his mother or top student title next stay tuned to your favorite tv network and find out
4332235 obama is prettier and nicer i asked around and i will preemptively concede that obama is more vivacious too
4332236 i have already conceded that barack obama is the prettiest candidate since the issue is raised before any others i will also concede that he is the nicest there hes prettier and nicer than mccain at what point does policy or integrity become interesting to democrats what is after nice being good to his mother
4332237 i will concede the demonstrated most important policy and political point of the democrats obama is prettier than anybody
4332238 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the failed policies and old politics that john mccain wants to continue the focus of our convention to people back here in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4332239 a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4332240 its not even a settled issue legally whether or not he will be able to go
4332241 ever since a beautiful goddess named shao materialized from an old ring life has been topsy turvy for high school student tasuke but just when tasuke is getting used to his host of magical house guests someone new arrives his older sister nana never mind magic and divinity how is tasuke going to explain two unchaperoned girls living in his house hed better think of a way fast before nana and ruuan the fake visiting teacher catch him in a closet cuddle
4332242 if you want your leadership to matter lead in something that matters very much to god
4332243 if i may be so bold there was another president
4332244 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4332245 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4332246 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4332247 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4332248 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4332249 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4332250 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4332251 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4332252 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4332253 i would like to clarify that we are honored that he will continue as our full partner in control of ua
4332254 he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment
4332255 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
4332256 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4332257 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence
4332258 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
4332259 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4332260 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4332261 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4332262 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
4332263 i heard that i heard her counting and praise herself
4332264 could be brought down to 8 to 9 per cent by march 2009 through co ordinated policy action
4332265 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment
4332266 there is no more important a decision than the decision to adopt and assume the responsibility for another life that decision carries an obligation to nurture that life to give it love to care for it
4332267 my notes indicate that the other incidents that have happened well usually they were shouting matches with other kids your son usually says he was reading and the other kids came and started bothering him calling him names the other kids say he starts it
4332268 well a couple of times your son has been alone to see the principal but once
4332269 another boy was sent to see the principal too yes it says that they started to argue then push one another but i see here
4332270 his teacher indicates that your son started getting into trouble with other children about only three weeks after he started at this school
4332271 and were what five months into the school year and no one thought to tell me before his teacher has not spoken to me at all about it and as i said my son has said nothing
4332272 look okay lets see how we can help the boy what does your file say of his temperment
4332273 it says it says hes very bright very able and has anger management problems
4332274 lets suppose its true for a moment what my son says you see i know he likes to read he loves reading i know too he doesnt mix well with other children he would rather read a book so to me him saying that he was sitting on a bench reading makes sense can you run with me on that for a second
4332275 so if thats true and the girl came up for whatever reason how likely do you think it is that my son hit her just because she bent down to pick up a pencil that mustve fallen near him i mean if he hit her she had to be close right
4332276 okay well it seems to me that if he hit her just because she dropped a pencil near him that that would indicate a pretty severe psychotic condition dont you think
4332277 okay do you have anything in your reports that suggest that my son suffers from a severe psychotic disorder
4332278 okay so lets go back to pretending my son was telling the truth that he was reading and the girl came up and began to bother him for whatever reason
4332279 from your notes do you think its likely that if what he says is true and he does say that he asked her to leave him alone do you think it is likely that she did
4332280 okay and if you review your notes about these other incidents how many of them or proportionately seem to have started with my son reading or seemingly minding his own business when another child came up to him
4332281 tell me have you ever watched what happens when children discover a way to get another child into trouble
4332282 they frequently then cajole or harass or set up that kid dont they to get them into trouble
4332283 yes thats right i used to see it all the time when i was growing up and ive seen it since you have too havent you
4332284 it becomes a game doesnt it and my son is easy to set off he likes to be alone he likes to read and he shouts really loudly when he gets upset doesnt he im sure thats all there in your notes
4332285 so it seems to me that we are now dealing with bullying arent we
4332286 i believe we have a problem with bullying happening here the children know it is easy to upset my son and as i said he screams really well i will speak with him when i get home i am asking for your help and support too what do you have about parenting how to help my son so that i can help him better at home too
4332287 you know i have dealt with many cases like this many
4332288 ive had parents screaming at me ranting and raving ive had them simply say okay whatever you suggest but ive never had anyone ask what was happening just before the incident i have not had anyone ever
4332289 question the evidence they get mad or they pretty much say nothing and i have to be honest i dont think i ever questioned what was going on just before but it makes sense it makes sense what you say ill take it back to his teacher and the principal well look at it and yes please speak with your son ill look to see what other intervention methods we have to help
4332290 i cannot think of a single time anyone ever asked for help with their parenting skills
4332291 no to answer your question no it is not deliberate to leave you out
4332292 it just happens that way we have our procedures that we follow and parents are not usually informed until well until a time like this we think it is better that way
4332293 so your procedures emphasize that it is best to work unilaterally rather than equally with the parents am i understanding that correctly
4332294 no we work with parents thats why you were called in today
4332295 okay i get that part but what i dont understand is that you waited until now until things reached this point to tell me that my son was having difficulties at school did you think he was coming home and telling me
4332296 because hes not of course every day i ask him how was his day at school and he tells me it was good he tells me what parts he enjoyed the most
4332297 well we appreciate that children will rarely tell their parents if theres a problem
4332298 yes its like management the further up the chain you go the less you actually know about the internal problems of your company because people at different levels are all trying to deal with it and no one wants to tell the boss
4332299 we have the same issues with schools sometimes in fact were very lucky that we were called in at this early stage with your son because most teachers in most schools dont want to work with us
4332300 what i am hearing you say is that teachers just like managers in companies dont want to talk about problems theyre having with higher ups
4332301 they keep you in the dark as a consequence and you only find out about it usually when the whole thing is about to explode is that right is that what you are saying to me
4332302 yes thats right everyone wants to solve their own problems and usually neglect to get the insight that someone else may have to offer them
4332303 and do you recall what we were talking about a moment ago in relation to my son
4332304 yes you were asking if it was normal that our services and maybe too the school worked unilaterally instead of with the parents
4332305 just like managers wont tell their bosses just like teachers wont involve you until the whole thing is about to get out of hand just like you waited until my son hit a girl to call me in
4332306 you understand now i have been confused as to why i was left out of discussions for what appears to have been a length of time thank you for helping me to understand
4332307 now please tell me what happened with the incident with the girl
4332308 now please tell me something can you tell me what my son was doing before he hit the girl
4332309 it says here that your son said he was sitting on a bench reading
4332310 it says here that your son said the girl started to bother him and he asked her to leave him alone
4332311 and do you believe that up to that point my son is telling the truth
4332312 well i dont know ive never spoken with your son so i cant form an opinion as to the veracity of his statement
4332313 who has spoken with my son who wrote that statement
4332314 it was written by his teacher it is just the bare facts of the incident the girl
4332315 said she was just walking by him dropped her pencil and as she bent down to pick it up he hit her
4332316 thats pretty extreme no wonder you called me in has he done that kind of thing before
4332317 i wonder when bacons rebellion is going to put out another damned cd
4332318 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness
4332319 i dont need a man to do anything for me
4332320 treat everyone the same until you find out theyre an idiot
4332321 i never feared her anger but over time i came to fear her hate
4332322 we cant do any good alone we can do plenty of hurt but little good
4332323 is it better the forget or remember is forgetting reality self will insanity is remembering pain self abuse
4332324 it is better to endure an injustice than inflict an injustice upon another
4332325 if being sane means thinking theres something wrong with being different id rather be completely fucking mental
4332326 celebrate yourself embrace your struggle and dont walk with shame
4332327 in the end we will conserve only what we love we will love only what we understand we will understand only what we are taught
4332328 parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell
4332329 there is in the worst of fortune the best of chance for a happy change
4332330 what we call human nature in actuality is human habit
4332331 do you suppose that if a wound goes so deep the healing of it can hurt almost as bad as what caused it
4332332 it was easy enough to despise the world but decidedly difficult to find any other habitable region
4332333 our scars have the power to remind us that the past was real
4332334 in a modern world xena would be classified as having attention deficit disorder and put on ritalin
4332335 that which gives us the ability to soar above all other creation will forever bind us to the ground
4332336 for every problem there is a solution even if its learning to live with the problem
4332337 courage isnt having the strength to go on its going on when you dont have the strength
4332338 our worth is not determined by what we have but by what we do with what we have
4332339 if you remove the rocks the brook will lose its song
4332340 often a fellows burden is just more than he can bear but his burden will be lighter if you prove to him you care
4332341 a friend gathers your shattered pieces and gives them back to you in the right order
4332342 when you come to the edge of all the light you have known and are about to step out into the darkness faith is knowing one of two things will happen there will be something to stand on or you will be taught how to fly
4332343 never berate yourself for what you have been its what you are about to become that is more important
4332344 yesterday is gone tomorrow has yet not come we have only today let us begin
4332345 women are like ovens we need 5 to 15 minutes to heat up
4332346 without pain there would be no suffering without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes to make it right pain and suffering is the key to all windows without it there is no way of life
4332347 a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out
4332348 the bigger you are and the longer youve been around the more mistakes youre allotted if you make enough mistakes and you own them its considered to be your style
4332349 a long time ago in an unguarded moment i used the word bastard to describe my political colleagues it was a foolish thing to do and i am very contrite i can only plead that it was completely true
4332350 i have no use for adventures nasty disturbing uncomfortable things make you late for dinner i cant think what anybody sees in them
4332351 if you want to wave to another driver please use all of your fingers not just one
4332352 a person who has not done one half his days work by ten oclock runs a chance of leaving the other half undone
4332353 stepan arkadyich smiled he knew so well this feeling of levins knew that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two sorts one sort was all the girls in the world except her and these girls had all human weaknesses and were very ordinary girls the other sort was her alone with no weaknesses and higher than everything human
4332354 if you didnt have bad days you couldnt appreciate the good ones
4332355 kid ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other and ive seen a lot of strange stuff but ive never seen anything to make me believe that theres one all powerful force controlling everything theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny
4332356 if you ever find yourself having sex with a clone of yourself its not gay its masturbation
4332357 reach for the stars you may not get one but you wont come up with a handful of mud either
4332358 despair is it is an artist and fingers that will never catch the vision
4332359 men are haunted by the vastness of eternity and so we ask ourselves
4332360 if they ever tell my story let them say i walked with giants men rise and fall like the winter wheat but these names will never die let them say i lived in the time of hector tamer forces let them say i lived in the time of achilles
4332361 this was the culture from which i sprang this was the terror from which i fled
4332362 for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo
4332363 when a story ends the last sentence is read the last thought is given the last word is spoken
4332364 dont wait till the end of the day to laugh because the world may end this morning
4332365 women might be able to fake orgasms but men can fake whole relationships
4332366 having sex is like playing bridge if you dont have a good partner youd better have a good hand
4332367 see the problem is that god gives men a brain and a penis and only enough blood to run one at a time
4332368 you have to be willing to fail in public if you really want to achieve any kind of growth as an artist
4332369 it is not what lies on the outside it is the heart and soul that makes us all who we are
4332370 the truth will set you free but 1st it will piss you off
4332371 i am with you always even until the end of time

4332447 why would a team be better off being down by a point than ahead by a point i think it has to do with mindset and risk tolerance teams that are down increase their risk tolerance and teams that are up decrease their risk tolerance my theory is that in general almost all offenses usually play below the optimum risk level they should typically be playing more aggressively but teams may actually start to optimize when behind in the 4th quarter teams with small leads would restrict their risk tolerance even more tilting further from the optimum risk reward balance

4332606 the outlook for fy09 is for a continued slowdown in consumer spending
4332607 our business is well prepared for this we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
4332608 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record since 2003 of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns and reaffirm our fy09 guidance of at least 5 10 pat growth off the new higher fy08 base
4332609 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
4332610 we utilised the strong economic climate in late 2006 and 2007 to implement cost efficiency programs that have delivered and will continue to deliver sustainable and significant cost savings both fixed and variable in fy08 and beyond
4332611 we ensured more than 12 months ago that we ordered for flat sales growth in 2h08 and we utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock
4332612 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being 8 lower than in fy07 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into fy09
4332613 despite volatile trading in second half 2008 and the requirement to clear seasonal stock our gross profit percentage is up approximately 10 basis points on second half 2007
4332614 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 40 0 throughout fiscal 2009 fiscal 2012
4332615 we stated at the time of our strategic plan announcement in march 2008 and at the time of our 1h08 results that we expect lfl sales growth in fy09 and fy10 to be 0 1 per annum and include two to three quarters of flat to negative growth
4332616 we now expect these two to three consecutive quarters of flat to negative lfl growth to be the first three quarters of fy09
4332617 given the extensive work we have undertaken to prepare for this environment we are confident that our company will deliver at least 5 10 pat growth per annum whilst operating under these conditions

4332688 after the first of the year i really started to notice the change ive not always been a real big supporter of the mayor but he is the mayor of the city and some of the recovery has been wonderful
4332689 ive probably had 375 events up there social charitable weddings
4332690 the space the view of the skyline i think of it as belonging to the people of new orleans
4332691 a lot of the time in these case theyre not formal committees just people who want to participate and help out for the event in this case theres a whole lot of us who want to celebrate the recovery its the third anniversary of katrina and the mayor deserves some credit weve all made mistakes along the way i want to celebrate the positive stuff
4332692 that has to be an oversight i dont know i wasnt in charge of the invitations i remember his name did come up i cant imagine dr blakely not coming to this
4332693 i know jackie i love jackie to death ive been at her house for events social and political i dont know
4332694 i do but its the anniversary its our third katrina anniversary we just wanted an opportunity to say theres a good thing going on in new orleans it saddens me to put in all this energy and effort and just
4332695 i think the mayor has done a lot of great things i think hes made some mistakes but i believe he is very sincere i dont try to second guess things that happen once decisions have been made i come from a military family you support your mayor i think thats far better than to try to second guess
4332696 weve been coming to the zoo since we were children ourselves and were delighted to see what a difference there is this time round

4332703 one of the major problems we have in clinical trials for new melanoma therapies is that we cant identify the people who are going to have a slower disease progression no matter what they receive in a clinical trial
4332704 when new treatments are tested it is necessary to show clinical benefit by comparing patients who receive the new therapy with those who do not although patients might all have the same type of cancers there can be big differences in their survival simply because their cancers behave differently and this may have nothing to do with the treatment if we are able to identify the good players and the bad players up front it becomes a whole lot easier figuring out whether good results are due to the new treatment or not most importantly far fewer patients would be needed for the clinical trials its partly because we cant clinically identify subtypes of patients that we have to do very large and very expensive trials and of course this increases the time it takes to test the clinical benefit of potential new therapies

4332708 barring the tort claims of fire fighters and police officers
4332709 i thought i was fed up with being a lawyer what i learned was i didnt hate the practice of law i hated the business of law as it was being practiced at law firms what brought me back to in house practice after this little five year experiment was the fact that at my core im a lawyer i worry about our profession and i worry about the failing of lawyers in law firms to understand that they are in a business and to understand that it is a customer service business and understand what customer service means
4332710 if you think of the law firm model the economic model is based upon total revenue brought in the door and thats a function of hourly rate times the number of hours that you actually bill for and can collect for that has absolutely no relationship whatsoever to the value that the corporate client places on the services

4332759 the resolution calls attention to the intolerable dilemma that torture presents when those who are supposed to be the healers in our society are involved in the abuse of prisoners
4332760 as professional licensure and codes of ethics are regulated by states california has the obligation to notify members of laws concerning torture that may result in their prosecution
4332761 this is an important advance not just in the u s but internationally as well
4332762 more doctors abet torture than treat its victims and it is time for them to be called to the mission of medicine not to practice torture and to be reminded that they will be held accountable to international law
4332763 the california legislature is sending a message to the federal government that they are wrong and i hope that other state legislatures will begin to do this
4332764 californias adoption of the resolution sends a clear message that we are going to live by the principles that this country is founded on
4332765 we will not let fear erode our civil liberties and we will hold health professionals accountable to ethical and legal standards
4332766 it is an ethical moral and spiritual issue that has not only become a shame but it is an evil in our midst

4332782 when the moon is directly overhead you weigh slightly less
4332783 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4332784 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4332785 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4332786 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4332787 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4332788 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4332789 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4332790 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4332791 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4332792 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4332793 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4332794 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4332795 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4332796 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4332797 who are open to doing something on the production side
4332798 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4332799 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4332800 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4332801 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4332802 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4332803 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4332804 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4332805 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4332806 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4332807 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4332808 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4332809 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4332810 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4332811 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4332812 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4332813 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4332814 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4332815 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4332816 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4332817 you can think about the what if what if what if
4332818 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4332819 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4332820 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4332821 this is a very good team weve been talking about playing with our backs against the wall this will be a good test for us
4332822 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4332823 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
4332824 its been a tough three games for us but the tournament is still in progress
4332825 after missing the first couple it seemed like i kept forcing it
4332826 it was totally in my head not taking the time to relax and put it where i needed to put it
4332827 i am very sad in a way because i feel i may have broken the tradition set by those archers who were before me
4332828 however i feel that by winning the silver it will make me crave the gold more and make me appreciate the gold more in the future so i think its a good experience
4332829 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive
4332830 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4332831 the rate of redistribution of some water birds has been dramatic in recent years but for some species we still know little about the extent to which decreases in numbers in the uk are due to redistribution to other parts of their range or real decreases in overall numbers
4332832 it is vital that we learn more about the extent and consequences of redistribution in order to ensure that these species are effectively conserved
4332833 every year a network of 500 bto volunteers monitor 30 000 nests providing an enormous wealth of information about the changes in nesting activities of many of our birds
4332834 anybody want to talk about the pick and roll now
4332835 we watched the game video of 2006 this morning we watched it yesterday pretty much every time we watched the scouting report
4332836 any time you get beat its embarrassing thats enough and we really used that to help us
4332837 this isnt the game that weve been pointing to in the whole olympics
4332838 weve got five more games to win and were here for the gold medal but did we think about it being greece and what happened the last time of course we did
4332839 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4332840 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4332841 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4332842 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4332843 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4332844 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4332845 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4332846 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4332847 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4332848 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4332849 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4332850 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4332851 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4332852 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4332853 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4332854 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4332855 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4332856 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4332857 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4332858 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4332859 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4332860 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4332861 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4332862 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4332863 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4332864 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4332865 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4332866 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4332867 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4332868 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4332869 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4332870 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4332871 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4332872 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4332873 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4332874 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4332875 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4332876 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4332877 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4332878 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4332879 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4332880 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4332881 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4332882 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4332883 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4332884 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4332885 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4332886 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4332887 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4332888 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4332889 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4332890 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4332901 i like to see 11 black jerseys flying to the football and thats what we did all night
4332902 were nowhere near where we need to be as a football team but i feel like were getting better every day
4332903 our defensive line did a pretty good job particularly in the second series against havelock
4332904 havelocks offensive line is very well coached and very big we saw a lot of positive things
4332905 hes always very emotional hes one of those kids that gives us everything hes got every time and plays with an abundance of energy
4332906 i think the kids are real excited the coaches are excited we saw some good things today offensively and defensively but we saw a whole lot we still have to work on
4332907 ive been waiting to play somebody else besides our good defense
4332908 we are not going to live and die by the run but we have got to gash up inside
4332909 it is still not where we want it but we still have got to work on it
4332910 weve only got one starter back on the offensive line we have got to find kids that take pride in what they are doing and get a little down and dirty i think they will get better
4332911 j j was a heck of a receiver serge is a good receiver but we have some good replacements
4332912 they are not going to drop anything they are going to catch the ball if it gets to them
4332913 reading the defense and knowing where the open receiver was going to be before the ball was snapped
4332914 we are putting a lot more responsibility on brett this year
4332915 we are going to let him make some decisions on some plays hes a savvy football kid and he knows the game he understands that he has got to be a leader and he has got a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and i think he is coming along with it
4332916 do you want to enlarge the font so you can see it clearly
4332917 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks national secretary dave oliver said
4332918 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs
4332919 china india malaysia are not doing it and neither are canada and the european union
4332920 we have made some mistakes in our short history we acknowledge and apologise for those mistakes we have learned from them and now it is time for us to move on to the next stage of our future
4332921 to win the right back to drill we must first change our understanding of the priorities for an exploration company in a sensitive environment
4332922 thereafter we aim to prove that we can be responsible participants in the mining industry so that marathon can become a worthy contributor to australias economic development and social welfare
4332923 misread both the extent of the technical risk associated with uranium exploration and mining and the heightened sensitivity of the community given the international context of the resource and its uses
4332924 it increased the rate of formation of tumours and it increased the number of tumours in the mice
4332925 we really dont know what is associated with tumour formation it might be all of the constituents
4332926 i guess the basic question is can we apply our data to humans and we dont know the answer to that
4332927 i think theres a need now for epidemiologists to take a look and see whether people that are using moisturising creams have an altered risk of skin cancers
4332928 one finds considerable inadequacies in i believe the way these studies have been undertaken
4332929 the more one looks through it the meaning that one might conclude from the data dissolves in those inadequacies
4332930 there are significant differences between the skin of mice and humans
4332931 for a study of this type to be reliable it should have been conducted over the 18 month life cycle of the mice this study went for just 17 weeks

4332952 i called your mom and she said its fine if you want to stay over
4332953 hey seriously its okay i probably bored you to death in the garden so when i stopped talking and looked at you you were asleep so i took you back down here
4332954 thats what im suppose to be saying since im the patient
4332955 so did you actually hear what i said back in the garden
4332956 so what i was saying is i felt like ive known you before you know its like ive met you before somehow
4332957 what do you mean this summer is the first time we met
4332958 no this was right after my mom passed away ive been here you know to greenville when i was a kid like what five six
4332959 my dad moved to greenville after mom passed away because of my birth and he put me with my grandparents after my grandmother died dad took me in and brought me to greenville to meet with his new wife and my new little seth weird though we were the same age it was good it was but i decided to live with my granddad in london until this summer dad decided to keep me with him for good grandads okay though he has friends in town and hes got this new lady hes living with haha why am i telling you all this
4332960 its okay i dont mind hayner its interesting to hear your story
4332961 i mean as a friend i love you for being comforting
4332962 yeah i mean no just come in want something to eat
4332963 i dont know i just didnt want to be at home nor be in the coffee shop
4332964 they went somewhere with vio and alice i didnt want to be alone

4332966 like weve met before i just know it when i was five or six i came to greenville after my grandmother died i flew alone so dad was suppose to pick me up i remember it was raining and i was alone with my bag and umbrella and and you were there
4332967 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4332968 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4332969 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4332970 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4332971 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4332972 almost every car i see in a traffic jam has a tomtom
4332973 there was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day 20 but at his gate lay a poor man named lazarus whose body was covered with sores 21 who longed to eat what fell from the rich mans table
4332974 now the poor man died and was carried by the angels to abrahams side the rich man also died and was buried 23 and in hell as he was in torment he looked up and saw abraham far off with lazarus at his side
4332975 how are the dead raised with what kind of body will they come
4332976 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you accursed into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels
4332977 that it may go well with you and that you will live a long time on the earth
4332978 now abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness
4332979 the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me
4332980 i now truly understand that god does not show favoritism in dealing with people 35 but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is welcomed before him
4332981 god opposes the proud but he gives grace to the humble
4332982 all children are born with a need to love and be loved a need to live lives that have meaning and a need to believe that tomorrow is worth getting up for
4332983 this secure love is a steady and sure love that is written on the hard drive of childrens souls its a complete love that they default to when their hearts are under attack its the kind of love that children can confidently carry with them into the future
4332984 the commitment of my will to your needs and best interests regardless of the cost
4332985 saying that we love our children and doing certain things that communicate love isnt enough weve got to love them in the way that god loves us when theyre unappreciative when they dont deserve it when its inconvenient when it is costly to us even when its painful children feel secure when they know they are accepted as they are
4332986 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything
4332987 if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given him
4332988 ive heard it all over the years im very aware of how strict no nonsense parents morally justify everything they do my questions are these was it worth it is that the way god treats us does god tease us with good things insult us for being excited about them and then scold us for trying to enjoy them
4332989 if theyre forming a line for parents who have fallen short and you feel that you should be in it youll have to get in line behind me weve all fallen short we may not have pulled a scene like the mother at the buffet but weve stolen our childrens joy unnecessarily more times than wed like to count weve turned non issues into crises weve sculpted molehills into mountains weve reached inside our childrens hearts and pinched them simply because we could
4332990 its all right i forgive you ill help you recover from the mistakes youve made with your kids
4332991 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid

4333011 fares dont rise as quickly as fuel does the fact is when people go online to book if one airline is one dollar above they will always choose the cheaper airline so airlines do as much as they can to avoid raising fares
4333012 if you have a lot of luggage an airfare on a more expensive airline might be the best deal
4333013 theres not much you can do unfortunately from minneapolis because we dont have southwest here and jetblue has lower fares
4333014 but one of those things that its so much a part of the whole sun country brand that at this point and time we didnt want to cancel that out
4333015 were entering into the low traffic period for the airlines so from sept 3 after labor day and until dec 16 were going to see sales and were going to see some good prices so this is a good time to travel

4333030 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4333031 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4333032 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4333033 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part
4333034 i think it was some kind of a bullet i cant say anything else right now because we cant see anyone here and i dont know who made the shot

4333040 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment

4333054 i always feel like i can win whether its against michael phelps or anyone
4333055 it was a good place to be mentally to think that i had a chance
4333056 we are pleased to add people of franks and johns caliber to our board
4333057 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board we look forward to working with them as our board continues its ongoing efforts to enhance stockholder value

4333061 we were pleased with the waca reaction and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa
4333062 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered

4333066 its always hard going to india you really need to go there and familiarise yourself with the country the plays the wickets and the conditions
4333067 its all good and well to train here but the conditions are so different sometimes that if we go a few days early that wouldnt bother me because i think it will be very important for my preparation to get acclimatised to those conditions
4333068 it can be very different and daunting but its a challenge and if we go early it wouldnt hurt anyone
4333069 im not sure wed be underdone if australia does not play between the bangladesh and indian series but wed be lacking in their conditions
4333070 were looking at it at the moment the champions trophy is still going ahead so we can only plan as if that is going to happen
4333071 the ideal situation wont be that we go to darwin for one dayers then home for 2 weeks then go to india we will certainly have some other things on the go if australia doesnt go to pakistan
4333072 we wait for these security reports spend all your time waiting i wish we knew two weeks ago because at least there would be closure

4333076 unfairly presumed that small business owners are able to provide paid sick leave and dont want to
4333077 that couldnt be further from the truth the fact is that many want to but simply cant afford it
4333078 it might even be wise to hire another hero just to collect resources and troops while you explore
4333079 as much as anyone my grandfather said we used to be a great nation the greatest but he didnt have all his wits maybe its true but no more everything falls i guess even a great oak a thousand years old will fall one day

4333096 up until fairly recently diablo ii was blizzards best selling game

4333101 motivational ploy for the gers lets take a quick look at the squad from edinburgh
4333102 the effect of opening up drilling in anwr on the current price of oil
4333103 although the referees and i are in agreement with your basic argument i regret to say that we will not be able to publish this work basically your main result the present impact of an anticipated future supply change is already known to economists although perhaps not to the democratic policy committee if hotelling didnt exactly spell this out in his original article certainly herfindahl and others had done so by the 1960s it is our policy to publish only original research that adds significantly to the body of received knowledge regarding energy markets and policy
4333104 we find that oil that is expected to reach the market some years hence has an immediate impact on oil prices
4333105 if oil firms were allowed to drill in anwr and many of the other areas that are currently off limits to oil production it is possible that these areas together might have a significant impact on world oil prices

4333118 but could you please bring out two pairs in the smallest size
4333119 we were pleased with the waca reaction and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa
4333120 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered
4333121 thats what were saying to the american people if you dont take it over if you dont win your government back if you dont vote for people you believe in who have a record of accomplishment and a good platform which you can see on votenader org whats left for you to decide i mean these two parties dont represent you in area after area their drum is beaten by the big corporations
4333122 and they really dont have a plan to get out of iraq and they want to expand the afghanistan war
4333123 good thing theres an election coming up once bush is gone the world will get better wont it at least one of the candidates has to be against all this war and threats of war right maybe obama is just playing the game when he promises fealty to tel aviv maybe he doesnt mean it when he sounds like bush in regards to iran maybe hell listen to the american people and not the generals after he gets elected and bring the troops back from iraq by the end of 2009
4333124 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
4333125 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
4333126 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
4333127 know my son with how little wisdom the world is governed
4333128 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4333129 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
4333130 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4333131 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4333132 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4333133 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4333134 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4333135 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
4333136 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
4333137 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
4333138 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life
4333139 910 could signify that it was a 9 inch model 8 9 but many just round it up and obviously they wouldnt want to use 900 or 901 or 90x anything since thats what asustek is doing
4333140 from preliminary mobile broadband test findings optus appears to be significantly slower than 3 and telstra next g with vodafone being roughly in line with optus
4333141 surprisingly though optus has by far the slowest ping times of the four networks tested and consistently so
4333142 after an hour of being on hold and extraordinary delays and being passed from left to right
4333143 theyre acknowledging that optus is in a technical bind with a technology that they signed up with
4333144 optus users should be going to optus and seeking some sort of compensation
4333145 we were pleased with the waca reaction and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa

4333156 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4333157 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan

4333169 its about understanding how to use the web to get your message out there and get your supporters to distribute it for you
4333170 this is the home page this is where were greeting people
4333171 do you think these guys could make eye contact with us no
4333172 hes using lots of different type faces at all different sizes which gives you a feeling of chaos
4333173 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that
4333174 it allows everybody who wants to do something to put their thing out there and see if people get excited about it
4333175 building communities online takes time and building strong robust web sites also takes time so its kind of like getting a 747 to take off from a small regional airport there aint enough runway
4333176 i dont think you can get elected president of the united states without using the internet but youre certainly not going to get elected president of the united states with it alone
4333177 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4333178 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4333179 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4333180 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4333181 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister

4333189 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4333190 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4333191 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4333192 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4333193 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4333194 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4333195 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4333196 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4333197 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4333198 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4333199 now the choice of an enterprise learning system depends upon reliability scalability and ease of use

4333208 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4333209 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4333210 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon

4333219 cash is king and with intense focus on the credit crunch companies are starting to recognise the benefits of managing tax effectively in the downturn
4333220 in turn we are starting to see more engagement with clients on areas such as recovering overpayments in relation to quarterly payments of corporation tax and accelerating refunds of tax paid in previous periods if they are now loss making as well as more applications to pay tax later than would normally be the case we are also seeing more focus on areas where tax costs can be reduced
4333221 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4333222 canadian firms need at the very least a level playing field for investment abroad if they are to take full advantage of global value chains and foreign affiliates this should be the key guiding principle for all reform of international business taxation
4333223 canadas share of global foreign direct investment is slipping in our view this is not the time to remove interest deductibility
4333224 continued failure by us tax policymakers to keep up with our top global economic competitors means that were solidifying a trend that will result in our children and grandchildren not seeing the economic growth weve seen in our lifetimes
4333225 theres a real wallet impact for americans as we continue to sit idly by while other countries improve the way they do business and we should be very concerned about jobs capital and investments moving from high tax countries to low tax countries
4333226 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4333227 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4333228 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4333229 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4333230 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4333231 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4333232 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4333233 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4333234 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4333235 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4333236 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4333237 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4333238 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4333239 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4333240 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4333241 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4333242 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4333243 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4333244 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me

4333256 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4333257 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4333258 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx
4333259 i spent the first 10 years of my life in a village that had no electricity no drinking water supply no doctor no roads and no phones i had to walk many miles to a school
4333260 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4333261 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4333262 this will be an historic event never have the two candidates been interviewed by a pastor in a church it will be a great day for all churches showing the importance of the local church being at the civil table

4333264 i had to wait until last august to transport them here by truck as the road is only accessible all the way to medog between august and october
4333265 the freight charge was so high i had to pay 50 yuan 7 3 for a table
4333266 my son is responsible for stocking our grocery and inn with daily necessities and for preparing meals i clean rooms do laundry and wash vegetables and dishes
4333267 you have to hire porters to transport goods here from pai township or even nyingchi it costs a lot of money this winter the snowfall was so heavy that the ground was buried one meter deep if we wanted something we had to pay porters 60 80 yuan 8 7 11 6 per kilo for their transportation work
4333268 living in such an isolated remote place friends mean everything to me
4333269 most of us are from other parts of the country we take care of each other
4333270 though life is not easy im hoping to find a wife and settle down here
4333271 here we can serve our guests with fresh vegetables and meat during most of the year because we have rented a plot to grow vegetables and raise pigs by ourselves
4333272 in the busiest day my wife cleaned more than 300 bowls and dishes for our guests
4333273 but we dont want her to travel such a long way to visit us during her holidays
4333274 backpackers to medog have considered my inn the best in the area

4333278 i treat all of my friends to free meals and a stay at my place
4333279 you will see some soldiers helping me clean rooms wash vegetables and even do the laundry
4333280 probably because of the bad influence of the march 14 turmoil happened in lhasa few travellers have entered medog en route duoxiongla this year
4333281 but last year more than 700 backpackers spent a night or two at my place
4333282 by working here seven or eight months a year we can support our son to study in nyingchi
4333283 we earned more than 20 000 yuan 2 923 last year at lage
4333284 competition in every business is sharp in the outside world
4333285 attacking a key institution was astounding coming from a leader who had embodied the system himself
4333286 theyre looking to find a way to marry the benefits of laptop performance with the instant on access and radically extended battery life people expect from smartphones
4333287 youll push a button and the system will be on in a second or two you cant run the full range of applications and multimedia but you will have outlook and basic browser functionality its a way for employees to simply turn on the machine and work
4333288 location presents some unique challenges and people inherently feel creepy when content is targeted to where they are and your actual physical location is being tracked
4333289 if people know this is being shared then people will react more strongly and protect themselves
4333290 its great that application providers are informing people and have robust controls but its important for people to realize if they turn it off for one application they are not turning off their whole device
4333291 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4333292 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows

4333297 successful implementation of strategy relies on achieving coherence between strategic direction organizational structure and performance management
4333298 most good examples of positioning tend to be from low cost strategies pursued by relatively simple organizations for more complex organizations the key to sustainable competitive advantage lies much more in resource and capability development
4333299 casual ambiguity is often viewed as an organizational defense against competitors and potential new entrants however paradoxically it may also prove problematic for managers inside the organization itself

4333301 i dont regret what weve done ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it

4333309 said to be in good health today after undergoing heart surgery in the united states an operation that left some iraqis wondering whether he is still fit for the job
4333310 a statement by the presidential press office said talabani entered the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota on aug 2 for knee surgery but the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves
4333311 we thought we could lie but reuters found out the truth broke the story and now we have to admit to the heart surgery
4333312 nassar al rubaie a senior shia politician said the medical reports from the hospital would determine whether the heart operation would affect mr talabanis ability to work

4333318 whats left for us to decide as the people is there anything left for us to decide as these corporations have hijacked our government and control about every department and agency
4333319 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4333320 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4333321 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4333322 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition

4333368 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
4333369 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
4333370 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
4333371 it has been like that in the one dayers for a while and it is something i have enjoyed and i have been able to be very vocal in team meetings
4333372 hopefully it will be the same in the test matches and my performances against south africa the form team in world cricket show i have improved this summer i am desperate for that to continue

4333422 fighting a fire in a silo is much different then fighting a normal building fire
4333423 silo fires are unique because you are dealing typically with a large structure used solely for storage of a material and contains confined spaces and has very limited access
4333424 working together with new england wood pellet employees was essential to ensuring that the fire was safely extinguished and that structural damage to each silo was limited so that the fire fighting effort was successful
4333425 we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations

4333436 while the champions league twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by icc event rules we have agreed to the icc request as a gesture of goodwill
4333437 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4333438 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests against the touring england squad and that will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4333439 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a de facto world test cricket championship bout between australia and south africa during december and january
4333440 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league twenty20 will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered

4333445 one who professes belief in the teachings of jesus christ
4333446 all right my bible tells me that all i need to do to be saved is to repent of my sins and accept the lord jesus christ as the son of god and this is where i have a problem with my evangelical brothers and sisters who in the world are we to suggest that you or anybody else is wrong if you have met the requirements of salvation
4333447 if the term christian is used as it is in standard english to mean someone who accepts jesus christ as the divine son of god and the savior of the world then the charge that we arent christians is false however if the word christian is given an overly narrow definition then it is merely a way of saying lds christians differ in some degree from other christians no one owns the term christian or has the right to deny it to others who worship jesus as the divine son of god
4333448 stoneridge made plain that investors must show reliance upon a defendants own deceptive conduct before that defendant otherwise a secondary actor may be found primarily liable plaintiffs evidence falls well short of this standard nothing about parmalats disclosures describes any defendants own conduct much less conduct that was deceptive

4333459 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation

4333471 saya tidak tahu apa rencana taufik setelah memutuskan untuk mengundurkan diri sepulang olimpiade beijing tapi saya berharap agar taufik tidak meningalkan dunia bulutangkis dan bersedia membantu membina perkembangan bulutangkis sebagai pembina atau motivator bagi adik adik juniornya
4333472 saya melihat taufik tidak berbakat menjadi pelatih kalau dia ingin tetap menekuni bulutangkis mungkin yang cocok untuknya adalah sebagai motivator dengan mengadakan berbagai program pelatihan untuk atlet atlet muda
4333473 dari segi prestasi saya kira sudah cukup bagi taufik dan sekarang bagaimana ia menjalani hidup untuk menatap masa depan
4333474 dari awal saya sudah menekankan bahwa kondisinya tidak memungkinkan untuk tampil maksimal karena butuh waktu lama untuk benar benar pulih dari serangan deman berdarah hanya tekad kuat yang membuatnya berusaha tampil untuk memberikan yang terbaik bagi negara untuk terakhir kali di ajang olimpiade

4333479 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4333480 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4333481 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4333482 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4333483 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4333486 in the end the secret to learning is so simple think only about whatever you love follow it do it dream about it and it will hit you learning was there all the time happening by itself
4333487 few parents have the courage and independence to care more for their childrens happiness than for their success
4333488 hey you guys are supposed to be at the recording studio
4333489 of course we are extremely excited about the students receiving their devices and beginning their school year but we also are excited about involving our technological partners and supporters in this historical event they have all played an important role in where we are today
4333490 this is the first time a university and a wireless company have worked together to combine cutting edge technology like iphone 3g and education in a way that enhances students access to educational resources and their overall learning experience
4333491 as the exclusive provider of the iphone 3g in the u s at amp t is proud to be the provider of communication services such as voice data internet access and e mail for acu students and faculty members
4333492 we have been eagerly awaiting and preparing for this group of incoming students to really show us how mobile learning can be used to enhance the learning experience
4333493 this is what we have been working towards for almost a decade
4333494 but until the iphone and ipod touch we had not seen a device compelling enough
4333495 instead of having one or two sources for information students today have thousands of resources at their fingertips
4333496 it is becoming our responsibility as educators to help them navigate the mountains of information and learn how to be selective
4333497 we are not merely providing cutting edge technology tools to our incoming students
4333498 we also are committed to continuing research about how technology can benefit learning and better prepare our students for the future for their sake its not good enough just to keep up we want to lead
4333499 when we look at the world around us we see the impact of digital technology in every academic discipline
4333500 we live in a time where artists paint without brushes and musicians compose without instruments
4333501 interaction between the professor and students is an integral part of the learning process
4333502 these devices will allow teachers to enhance the educational experience
4333503 i know that it will be bolt all the way in fact i believe that he will take the sprint double as there are few who should beat him in the 200 meters

4333535 the way that asafa has been running in the last month makes me believe that he cannot be beaten over the distance
4333536 tyson gay is an awesome athlete but i dont think that he can beat our two big guns
4333537 this is the big race never before have we seen two jamaicans in an olympic or world championship 100 metre race and any of the two can win
4333538 if there is anyone who does not show an interest in this race he should be taken to the mental hospital to be examined

4333547 it should have been a chance for chinese soccer to be honoured but in the end it was dishonoured what has gone wrong there
4333548 the fa officials need to reflect upon themselves now chinese soccer is confronted with the biggest ever crisis our grassroots are withering our professional league is also spiralling downward and can produce few quality players who should be responsible for all these mess ups
4333549 in my city we are implementing long term plans for infrastructure upgrades including street repaving relining water mains working with the state to modernize the route 29 freeway in ways that spur downtown revitalization and transforming brownfields for homeownership and commerce
4333550 but it is way past time to increase federal support and put in place tax incentives bonds and other measures that assist state and local governments
4333551 i expect that the public will understand that if it comes to safety they dont want their children or anybody in the family to be at risk
4333552 friday night football is a tradition in martinsville and it seems like everythings getting changed from martinsville high school and it should be one of the things that stays the same
4333553 it seems reasonably feasible that in the future once neuroscientists learn much more about consciousness and its mechanism why not imitate it
4333554 we construct what we call brain based devices or bbds which i think will be increasingly useful in understanding how the brain works and modeling the brain but it also may be the beginning of the design of truly intelligent machines
4333555 he doesnt believe that ai is fundamentally impossible only that the current research program is fatally flawed instead he argues that to get a device or devices with human like intelligence would require them to have a human like being in the world which would require them to have bodies more or less like ours and social acculturation i e a society more or less like ours
4333556 penrose grants that we may be able to artificially construct conscious intelligence and
4333557 classical ai is unlikely to yield conscious machines systems that mimic the brain might
4333558 machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains
4333559 oh my god you really are made for him you are such a know it all
4333560 it doesnt matter stop being such a know it all
4333561 that would imply that im right im inclined to think i am even beyond the general knowledge that im always right
4333562 those moments are few and far between and certainly not in this store so am i wrong
4333563 im not fluent but i think thats youre right in idiot
4333564 well this one is very active for 15 weeks hopefully this time youll have a boy looks like you need one
4333565 the 2005 world gymnastics champion hurt the ankle during training aug 4 but competed on uneven bars in both the preliminaries and the team finals
4333566 so what do you say little lady come with me to a hotel and well pop some champagne and get to know eachother a little better
4333567 oh come on honey i thought we were having ourselves a nice little time
4333568 reading a magazine is the same as reading a book
4333569 here watch hannah montana while we go in the other room and do ecstasy
4333570 dicks are a dime a dozen and im searching for a heart of gold
4333571 talk to the hand this gal aint listening right now
4333572 you want to know about my conclusion about 4 a gallon gas just divide eight years by two oilmen in the white house and you have your 4 a gallon
4333573 at the end of the day you have two oil men in the white house and they represent big oil the republicans are doing the bidding of big oil
4333574 represents another big giveaway to oil companies already making billions in profits
4333575 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil invest in the renewable energy sources crack down on excessive speculation and stand up to countries colluding to shake down american consumers
4333576 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
4333577 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oil is filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions
4333578 my message will actually be pretty much the same in both the primary and the general
4333579 my primary and general election opponent come from very similar backgrounds both of them are very liberal on fiscal and social issues
4333580 were simply spending money that our kids are going to have to pay back
4333581 we have to get over this idea that federal money is free
4333582 i hold a very high standard of when to put our sons and daughters in harms way
4333583 to me iraq did not meet that standard but once we are there i do not believe we should set a timetable for withdrawal our troops must withdraw in victory and with the best possible outcome for iraqi residents
4333584 this will be a very close race im hearing people say they will vote for stevens even if he is in jail
4333585 i have a good chance but they may very well nominate him
4333586 i cant say i would definitely beat him but there is a chance i could it would be a shame if we let it go
4333587 senator stevens is the kind of guy who led to the kind of losses we had in 2006 and expect in 2008
4333588 and yet has a very good chance of picking up the nomination
4333589 an alcoholic has got to hit bottom just become the worst drunk in the gutter and we may have to reach that point before we change
4333590 i supported hillary in the primaries and wont be voting for obama unless he makes her his vp at the convention in two weeks
4333591 the uncertainty that obamas words inspire seems to be intentional
4333592 though it does not appear that he means to confuse he does speak with a thoughtful lack of clarity
4333593 accompanied his muslim stepfather to a nearby mosque of fridays and prayed at his side for the blessings of allah
4333594 religion was an expression of human culture she would explain not its wellspring
4333595 in sum my mother viewed religion through the eyes of the anthropologist that she would later become it was a phenomenon to be treated with a suitable respect but with a suitable detachment as well
4333596 obamas own church lists heaven among the benefits of salvation in the altar calls that close its services
4333597 the product of a new postmodern generation that picks and chooses its truth from traditional much as a man customizes his meal at a buffet
4333598 obama had found the answer to his souls need and only a cynical heart would refuse the possibility of a lonely black man in his twenties finding faith through the preaching of gods word
4333599 he had found a faith a people the vessel for belief that he had longed for
4333600 came with sadness with grief for the loss of years and the pain that politics presses into private life
4333601 one can imagine in an obama presidency white house conferences on faith and poverty or religions responses to racism that are more than time wasting mockeries of national ills
4333602 even if i were already in heaven i would ask for a furlough to come enjoy your presentation
4333603 excuse me sir this gentleman seems to have a ticket for 14a
4333604 yes sir but your ticket is for chicago and this is the flight to denver

4333610 kiss me in front of the paparazzi like that now itll be in m tiger beat and pretty much every other magazine in the world the only reason i even came with you was to get into that club my mom wouldnt let me go alone so you can go find someone else to make out with but good luck finding someone better than e s hottest celebrity
4333611 adrian and i have talked for a long time at different times is it ever going to happen is it not going to happen and im so excited that it has to bring my family home and to be back in the northwest especially on days like this because we all know that in december were not going to get many of this so take advantage of it while its good but the key thing and what i want to emphasize is that im coming home to play im coming home to help the sounders win to help the sounders establish themselves as one of the top franchises in the country if not really the benchmark for what soccer is going to become in this country through adrian and through joe roth tod leiweke the seahawks and that whole organization there is no reason why this wont be the benchmark of soccer in the u s not only from the first year but the many many years to come and im very very excited about that part and coming home and being a part of that really thats the main reason i came back at this stage i had offers to continue playing in the premier league and possibly going back to some of the other countries that ive been to i had a lot of fun and its been a great journey but the biggest part of a new franchise and to be a part of everything that i feel that this team is going to stand for is just to good of an opportunity to pass up i hope to be a part of this franchise i would love to be what franz beckenbauer has become to bayern munich for example i would love to work my way up and to really be a part of sounders fc for life

4333716 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4333717 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4333718 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4333719 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control

4333740 the performers for chinese character parts went into the models underground at 2 pm and after getting in there they could not come out
4333741 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance
4333742 so altogether they had to stay there for six to seven hours and they could not even go to the toilet so they all wore nappies
4333743 with all the spectators coming into the stadium the performers have to prepare in advance
4333744 every performer should stay in a fixed place at a fixed time
4333745 its as if weve changed from am radio to fm radio and the improved fidelity means we can put more information into the same bandwidth
4333746 its as if on a highway weve squeezing four or even eight cars in the place where one car would have been otherwise

4333759 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4333760 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4333761 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in china has been cut back
4333762 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4333763 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4333764 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4333765 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4333766 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4333767 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4333768 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4333769 we want to see more balance where everyone has a good chance of winning rather than just being an also ran
4333770 trying to get any sport into where its not known at all where theres no interest isnt easy
4333771 its easy when you to go a country and say hey were an olympic sport right away you get instant credibility
4333772 the problem we face now is that were not an olympic sport but we want to be again
4333773 if we can get kids interested at a young age we have a better opportunity to see our sport develop
4333774 a lot of people dont understand now to play it
4333775 we need to get more kids involved in the sport our numbers have definitely dropped
4333776 kids are just not playing as many sports as they used to
4333777 outside of the united states its very difficult anywhere you go but thats kind of part of growing the sport
4333778 were playing the game the way we want to play it
4333779 hopefully by time we get ready to make our presentations well have more accurate figures so the ioc has something they know were not just pulling out of the air
4333780 they tell you how disheartened they are that their olympic dreams have faded away
4333781 i keep those handy on my desk because every day i can come in and look at them and say hey weve got to do more we let down those young athletes out there and we just cant do it again

4333785 itd be kind of cool wed have a tuesday night wednesday night virginia extravaganza a few weeks from now
4333786 for too long in va for too long democratic candidates in the general election would say why bother and republican candidates would say we dont need to go there but im so happy that this year because of the work weve done together virginia is a state that is a competitive state a state where polling is neck and neck and where my good friend and our next pres barack obama is coming to va again and again and again to make the case to virginians about why he should be president
4333787 jikalau tuhanmu menghendaki tentu dia menjadikan manusia umat yang satu tetapi mereka senantiasa berselisih pendapat kecuali orang orang yang diberi rahmat oleh tuhanmu dan untuk itulah alloh menciptakan mereka
4333788 dan janganlah kamu termasuk orang orang yang mempersekutukan alloh yaitu orang orang yang memecah belah agama mereka dan mereka menjadi beberapa golongan tiap tiap golongan merasa bangga dengan apa yang ada pada golongan mereka
4333789 jika seorang hakim memutuskan suatu hukum kemudian berijtihad maka jika benar ia mendapat dua pahala namun jika salah baginya satu pahala
4333790 orang yang menyelisihi pendapat kami karena konsekuensi dalil yang ia pahami pada hakikatnya tidak berselisih dengan kami bahkan bersepakat dengan kami karena kamipun menyelisihi mereka karena konsekuensi dalil yang kami pahami
4333791 bidah itu disertai dengan perpecahan sedangkan sunnah disertai dengan persatuan
4333792 dan janganlah kamu menyerupai orang orang yang bercerai berai dan berselisih sesudah datang keterangan yang jelas kepada mereka mereka itulah orang orang yang mendapat siksa yang berat
4333793 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya kelompok alloh itu adalah golongan yang beruntung
4333794 ketahuilah bahwasanya umat sebelum kalian dari ahlul kitab telah berpecah belah menjadi 72 golongan dan sungguh umat ini akan berpecah belah menjadi 73 kelompok 72 kelompok terancam di neraka 1 kelompok masuk surga kelompok itu adalah al jamaah
4333795 semuanya di neraka kecuali satu kelompok yaitu kelompok yang aku dan sahabatku berada di atasnya
4333796 sabda rosululloh kecuali satu kelompok telah menjelaskan dengan sendirinya bahwa kebenaran itu hanya satu tidak berbilang seandainya kebenaran itu bermacam macam maka tentunya rosul tidak akan mengatakan kecuali satu kelompok
4333797 generasi pertama dari umat ini seluruhnya senantiasa berada di atas jalan yang satu di atas kata hati yang satu dan madzhab yang satu sama al quran adalah pegangan mereka sunnah rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam adalah imam mereka mereka tidak menggunakan berbagai pendapat dan tidak pula bersandar pada hawa nafsu mereka senantiasa berada dalam keadaan seperti itu
4333798 ini merupakan perkataan yang paling rusak karena jika perbedaan adalah rahmat tentunya persatuan merupakan hal yang dibenci ini jelas bukan perkataan seorang muslim karena kemungkinan hanya dua bersatu maka dirahmati alloh atau berselisih sehingga alloh murka
4333799 rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam membuat garis lurus dengan tangannya sambil bersabda ini jalan alloh yang lurus kemudian beliau membuat garis garis di sebelah kanan dan kiri garis lurus tersebut sambil mengatakan ini jalan jalan menyimpang tidaklah setiap jalan melainkan di dalamnya ada syaithon yang menyeru mengajak ke jalan itu kemudian beliau membaca firman alloh dan sesungguhnya ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan janganlah kalian mengikuti jalan jalan lain yang menyimpang yang memecah belah kalian dari jalan nya demikianlah dia mewasiatkan kepada kalian mudah mudahan kalian bertaqwa
4333800 wajib atas kalian untuk mengikuti sunnahku dan sunnah para khulafaur rosyidin yang mendapat petunjuk berpegang teguhlah kepadanya dan gigitlah erat erat dengan gigi gerahammu
4333801 kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada alloh al quran dan rosul sunnahnya
4333802 tidak boleh bagi seseorang untuk berhujjah dengan ucapan seseorang dalam masalah khilafiyah pengutamaan suatu pendapat atas pendapat yang lain bukan karena pendapat itu pendapat imam fulan atau syaikh fulan akan tetapi karena ketegasan dan kejelasan dalil dalil yang mendasari pendapat tersebut
4333803 setiap orang dapat diterima atau ditolak perkataannya kecuali penghuni kubur ini yaitu rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam
4333804 mereka tak ubahnya seperti suporter olahraga yang saling menyemangati kelompoknya mereka di hajr hanya karena tidak membicarakan si fulan atau jamaah tertentu
4333805 dan taatlah kepada alloh dan rosul nya dan janganlah kamu berbantah bantahan yang menyebabkan kamu menjadi gentar dan hilang kekuatanmu dan bersabarlah sesungguhnya alloh beserta orang orang yang sabar

4333810 the rowers are in for quite a few chances of winning but when racing comes at the olympics it really is difficult to consistently come up with your good results
4333811 the olympics put a lot of pressure on you and people have got to be aware of that
4333812 im just hoping they do all strike it lucky and get the first couple of races under way and get a good roll on it then if the first couple start winning you never know what happens
4333813 i got the first one under way and once that happened i knew there was nothing going to stop me i knew i was the best and the whole team sort of got in that same vibe and we just suddenly felt invincible
4333814 in these circumstances unless the board is able to secure new capital the future ability of the company to trade must be considered uncertain

4333818 2008 marks the year in which no less than ten biennials and triennials are set to open in september in the asia pacific region alone anchored by the 2008 beijing olympics the convergence of these events and the various national and regional agendas cultural economic political that define them exemplify both the magnitude of the changes taking place in asia but also the scale and ambition within which they are occurring such scale and ambition and the confidence with which they are pursued have led to the idea of this moment possibly being the asian century

4333821 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press

4333823 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

4334048 it was quite a complex incident and certainly had a lot of demands
4334049 theres only one other time that a tractor trailer busted through the guardrail about 15 years ago but just the cab was hanging over the edge
4334050 other than that i dont think a vehicle has ever actually made it into the water
4334051 the unique nature of this incident and its aftermath have posed challenges for us all

4334230 why does zacarias moussaoui get to live for his role in the september 11 terrorist attacks which killed thousands of people
4334231 why is it that doing right doesnt seem to pay while those who do wrong not only get away with it but seem to be rewarded for it
4334232 how can you continue to trust god when you face situations that dont make sense and seem to contradict everything you know about god
4334233 i like the bungee when they go against each other whatever one that is

4334236 absolutely when you see younger guys go up it always gives you hope when i first signed with the yankees they werent as into the younger guys as much as they are now when i first got here theyd go out and pick up veteran guys and stuff like that but seeing the younger guys it gives us hope and gives us a little more push and more fight for what you want to do

4334246 then the people begged for a king and god gave them saul son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin who reigned for forty years
4334247 ok shes not a real girly girl so i need something pretty simple

4334253 it conveys the resonance of unconditional love to the physical plane

4334263 weve got many lawsuits out there that we know about not counting the ones that we may not be familiar with
4334264 we are having a problem of cases being settled behind our backs which will ultimately show that we do have a problem
4334265 to have a lawsuit to come through that can be damaging we could lose jobs lose services it would affect us all the way around
4334266 when you look at all these lawsuits theres something wrong with that department
4334267 in 2005 now attacks on it are incredibly rare but only after
4334268 peduli sih peduli mas tapi boro boro ngurusin orang lain ngurusin diri sendiri aja sudah susah
4334269 baby i think we can go out to dinner tonight
4334270 maybe ill take you to that gourmet place you been wanting to try
4334271 but you always said it was too expensive its not nice to mock me so unless
4334272 profits are through the roof this quarter not only are we turning a profit not only can i pay back the bank loan but we got enough to move out of this dump im thinking something as far away from the ground as possible the skys the limit how does a deluxe apartment sound
4334273 i wish i could have pitched a little better in front of my family and friends the houston native said
4334274 i would have liked to do both but nothing would make me pass up my first big league shot said espineli who had a 5 40 era in nine games
4334275 ive never had anything like that before said rowand who felt the twinge while stretching
4334276 the loss of requan boyette for the time being has certainly put a damper on our run game
4334277 requan is a great leader when he is on the field and a great leader when he is off the field
4334278 he has not missed anything he has been at every meeting he is there for everything we do inside he is absolutely on the rehab machines and doing everything he is suppose to do right now he is not going to let people get down
4334279 he jackson hasnt if you remember had a lot of practice at running back because i moved him in spring practice from defense
4334280 i just thought he was not very natural as a defensive back and watching him in the kicking game run just his out and out speed and quickness and the thing that was most evident in the spring for us was the lack of speed and quickness on offense
4334281 pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation such as poverty hiv aids climate and human rights
4334282 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4334283 in my judgement this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality
4334284 and i think it is something that all democratic countries should speak out strongly against and i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4334285 obviously weve called on both sides to cease the fighting and i gather a ceasefire now appears to be taking hold but we do call on russia to respect the
4334286 in light of the current situation in georgia and after consultation with our american allies we agreed that it would be inappropriate to go ahead with exercise vigilant eagle a planned combined norad russia military exercise that was scheduled to begin august 20 2008
4334287 we will assess participation in future such exercises as the situation evolves
4334288 no less than the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1978 the events of the past several days are a bell ringer for defense stocks
4334289 we strongly urge purchase of aerospace defense issues a sector which has declined with the broad market since the start of the year
4334290 we now know that if topoff had been a real life exercise people would have likely died because we couldnt maintain reliable tactical communication
4334291 if you cant do the big attacks do the small attacks do smaller attacks and more of them
4334292 reach out artfully curl your fingers pull them back ever so wistfully
4334293 ive done two remixes for the new primal scream single uptown one of which is now on my page have a listen see what you think
4334294 a little roller coaster y obviously i was really happy to kind of bring home the relay obviously we would have wanted to win gold we all put our hearts into it i was happy to go a best time in the relay split last night i just maybe took it out a little too fast i was trying to stay with the girl and kind of ran out of gas at the end completely there was nothing more i could do i feel like the schedule was definitely a lot tougher than i thought it would be doing it twice i handled it at trials but it was the olympic games very challenging im just proud of winning three medals would have hoped for it to go a little bit better but you really cant stick your nose up at three olympic medals
4334295 i think in the middle there i was fine through 400 400 and it was just really tough going from right after those four 400s into the 200s it was kind of like ugh i felt so good for the relay because i actually had some time off and stuff i think the double really took it out of me
4334296 definitely i keep saying that the mental energy and emotional energy and physical energy that it takes to go out there and get up every time even for a prelim you have to put in some kind of effort even michael just its incredible hes swimming even more than i swam hes doing in world record time gold medals it definitely gives me a lot more respect even more than i already had for him
4334297 i think it would have been a little bit easier mentally on me just losing by seven hundredths is an awesome thing on your mind but i dont think as far as anything would go id still put in the same effort
4334298 im going to be in the sport for awhile and i want it to be fun this schedule you look at it and you dont go into it as excited as i feel like i would if i was swimming in just two or three and a relay so i think i will evaluate and maybe focus in on three or four two or three instead of five events
4334299 not really it was my decision to do that it just kind of fell into place by itself i decided ok these are the events ill swim at trials i ended up doing really well at trials and winning them all i felt like why would i just drop this event i think it was just a learning experience i think you just take that learning out of this and use that in the next four years
4334300 i think she kind of learned that around the same time i did
4334301 for the longevity in the sport you have to make sure that youre picking events that youre really excited to do and not just because they have chosen you i feel like because i have a lot of events that gives me a lot of options i dont have to be stuck with one event i can choose from certain events and not race all of them
4334302 i dont think its really fair i think michael is doing what hes doing and its incredible but it kind of makes the rest of us look like if you dont win a gold medal its not laughs you know i even got a best time in the 200 free and i didnt medal its tough but obviously michael gets our sport out there and thats great i just have to always put in perspective as far as me personally and think ok silver medal two bronze im moving up in the world its better than last time and im not close to being done
4334303 last time i only took about a week or so this time im definitely gonna take a break its been four years just kind of working really hard take a month of just relaxing a tropical island or something
4334304 i think it was really cool the relay even though we didnt win but i love that whole team thing you hold hands lift them up to the crowd i was really looking forward to that i think thats what helped me swim so fast on the end of it
4334305 it means a lot it means people are behind me and support me and i hope i do a good job
4334306 when you sit on this deck and we can see the sunset from this one and north dakota has beautiful skies usually clear no smog and a gazillion stars
4334307 we moved it in in the fall of 97 mainly for a hunting cabin and we spurred out in there to tourism
4334308 they can bring their horses out their or hike out there its just a short walk up to the fence or horse back ride and there is no traffic there is no people you have the place to yourself with the wildlife
4334309 from preliminary mobile broadband test findings optus appears to be significantly slower than 3 and telstra next g with vodafone being roughly in line with optus
4334310 surprisingly though optus has by far the slowest ping times of the four networks tested and consistently so
4334311 after an hour of being on hold and extraordinary delays and being passed from left to right
4334312 theyre acknowledging that optus is in a technical bind with a technology that they signed up with
4334313 optus users should be going to optus and seeking some sort of compensation
4334314 down here we sell to the ang mos so dont complain about the price if you want to buy
4334315 unfortunately the linkup service is no longer available please visit box net for your storage needs
4334316 i am so sorry about our breakup several years ago i have been thinking about you a lot since then will you please consider taking me back just one more chance im sorry about all the horrible things i said about you and your operating system you were the best i ever had mobileme and i are finished
4334317 no one had enough brains and guts to risk humiliation to raise a hand and say chief were not ready here lets stop everything as a result mobileme badly crashed on launch
4334318 fondamentalmente non permetto ai miei atleti di vedere le loro famiglie prima delle gare per questo non sono molto popolare non ho mai ricevuto fiori
4334319 sembra un bambino di 12 anni ma gioca come un duro
4334320 il mio soprannome il muro ma non posso esserlo sempre e facile criticare da fuori vorrei vederli qui sulla sabbia a giocare e dare lanima per il brasile
4334321 adesso comincia la caccia dobbiamo uccidere un leone al giorno
4334322 gli inglesi sono andati bene ai mondiali questi non sono i mondiali
4334323 se non andassi alle olimpiadi di londra 2012 sarebbe come avere una festa nella porta di fianco e non essere invitato
4334324 se fossi andato pi forte avrei probabilmente subito un test anti doping
4334325 questa mattina non pensavo certo a una medaglia e non ho portato la divisa ho dovuto farmi prestare la giacca da uno dei ragazzi matt targett ndr e i pantaloni da cate campbell lui tre volte pi grosso di me lei ha le gambe lunghe il triplo e gi tanto che abbia portato il costume
4334326 mi sono fatto male al ginocchio questa mattina ma sarei stato disposto a morire sulla pedana combattendo per il mio paese
4334327 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4334328 i believe weve crossed the rubicon and established the premise the investors will be helped
4334329 given that china got these games largely by making promises about human rights and press freedom and given that the chinese government has lied through its teeth about keeping those promises is the ioc in any way embarrassed
4334330 there were certainly some hopes and aspirations outlayed in 2001 as to how the games could have a positive impact on the wider social framework and i think we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in a number of areas youre here reporting on the games the world is watching
4334331 we are very proud of the fact that these games are progressing with spectacular sport spectacular sport venues operationally running very smoothly and thats what were here for
4334332 the iocs only remit is to bring sport and the olympic values to this country that has been happening and the organizers have put on an operationally sound games for the athletes this is an event first and foremost for the athletes
4334333 i would have liked to hear the answer to that question and i would have liked to have heard the answer to my question
4334334 youre in china youre supposed to cover the games i dont know what you are saying is true or not
4334335 if you have questions like that the protesters things like that you should go to the authorities of public security
4334336 we are confident that with the games coming to china we are going to not only promote the economy but also enhance all social sectors including education medical care and human rights
4334337 certainly we will give the media complete freedom to report on anything when they come to china
4334338 i did not say that china will promise to do whatever with the games to china i did not say that but i say the games will open the horizon about china people will see better for themselves what chinas like
4334339 i think a few a very few people come here to pick to be critical to dig in to the small details to find fault with that that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4334340 this is not a debate you have your turn i have mine okay thank you
4334341 media should be allowed to do their job and we disapprove of their work being hindered when they do not appear to be breaching the rules i cant be more clear than that
4334342 usually one or two of the other party are chosen as a nod to non partisanship
4334343 you cant tell me that the very best people in the country except for one in 1999 were all democrats but then suddenly two years later all the best people in the country except for one were republicans
4334344 if the country is a third democratic a third republican and a third independent a democratic president who appoints only democrats has eliminated two thirds of the public from consideration
4334345 that rare combination of humility and confidence required to perform wisely at the highest level
4334346 the world has changed fundamentally and our system has not been able to adapt to these changes
4334347 the kind of reaching across the aisle that all of us believe is necessary
4334348 theres so much passion in the work i imagine him there doing it
4334349 the elements of disbelief are very strong in the morning
4334350 he could turn a boring party into something really interesting
4334351 he was so outspoken but his saving grace was his innate goodness and hed say things that just got you
4334352 the situation is a matter of considerable concern and bears close watching because it raises an obvious question how far is russia ready to go
4334353 is there yet another russian assault to come such as in azerbaijan ukraine or armenia or maybe the baltic states
4334354 the market would react sharply if theres another russian military action
4334355 it would be an act of war against europe and america all hell would break loose and it would likely drive up the price of oil to about 170 a barrel
4334356 since no one at this time will stand up to them at least militarily i think were likely to see increasing russian use of military force and additional support of the wests enemies including sponsors of terrorism
4334357 its more of a geopolitical game essentially a warning to both america and nato
4334358 a pretty smart guy but who is cranky and shoots from the hip
4334359 youre getting a great return for high risk and for putting up with a lot
4334360 it has the taste of the forbidden the illicit the subversive even
4334361 eating with your hands its pure regression naturally everyone wants it
4334362 accelerate florida will pump billions of dollars into floridas economy through construction and economic development projects that are already in the hopper
4334363 they want to know that permitting and regulation the walls are being broken down
4334364 unfortunately these problems are not going away and avoiding a special session wont reduce the hurt floridians are feeling or solve the deep woes confronting our state
4334365 this is so beautiful why dont we just go and use the crew and make a feature
4334366 the fact that its so thin and fluffy speaks for itself
4334367 a key reason the internet has been such a success is because it is the most open network in history it needs to stay that way barack obama strongly supports the principle of network neutrality to preserve the benefits of open competition on the internet
4334368 john mccain does not believe in prescriptive regulation like net neutrality but rather he believes that an open marketplace with a variety of consumer choices is the best deterrent against unfair practices
4334369 barack obama believes that providing opportunities for minority owned businesses to own radio and television stations is fundamental to creating the diverse media environment that federal law requires and the country deserves and demands as president he will encourage diversity in the ownership of broadcast media promote the development of new media outlets for expression of diverse viewpoints and clarify the public interest obligations of broadcasters who occupy the nations spectrum
4334370 john mccain will lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent
4334371 obama is also opening up the campaign and giving average americans a chance to offer opinions and information on important policy issues and americans have responded over 15 000 policy ideas have been submitted through the web site
4334372 offering simple common sense solutions to real problems is at the core of the mccains innovation agenda
4334373 competition has been a great strength for america offering opportunity low prices and increased choice for our citizens markets work best when there is robust competition competition means that any new devices invented cost less because there are more choices this ensures more americans can afford to be part of the digital economy
4334374 an obama administration will look carefully at key industries to ensure that the benefits of competition are fully realized by consumers obama will strengthen the antitrust authorities competition advocacy programs to ensure that special interests do not use regulation to insulate themselves from the competitive process obama will also strengthen competition advocacy in the international community as well as domestically he will take steps to ensure that antitrust law is not used as a tool to interfere with robust competition or undermine efficiency to the detriment of u s consumers and businesses he will do so by improving the administration of those laws in the u s and by working with foreign governments to change unsound competition laws and to avoid needless duplication and conflict in multinational enforcement of those laws in short an obama administration will take seriously its responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws so that all americans benefit from a growing and healthy competitive free market economy
4334375 the trees been dying for at least five years now
4334376 i think the fire department was here a few weeks ago and they cut down part of the tree because it had some dead branches this tree came down all of the sudden and you see the result broken windows broken awnings broken gutters
4334377 i am here to honor the spirits of the dead because i want to thank those who worked for the nation
4334378 he has no guts i dont think he needs to care about what
4334379 our country has inflicted great pain on many nations especially those in asia on behalf of the i express my condolences and deep regret to all the victims
4334380 i pledge that we will renew our commitment not to fight war and that we will lead the international community as a peace cooperating nation to actively establish lasting peace in the world
4334381 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4334382 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols
4334383 combined knowledge of cloud development satellite observations and mathematical calculations of aerosol concentration and cloud properties in an effort to explain how the two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds can influence cloud coverage and life cycle
4334384 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
4334385 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
4334386 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4334387 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed were illiterate
4334388 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4334389 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
4334390 the idea is to tell moms who are breastfeeding to take it a step forward to help other moms who cannot immediately breastfeed
4334391 ang latest openings ay sa ating magagaling na engineers especially in the last two years mayroon nang nakuha ditong mga 80 na mga kababayan natin marami silang demand for skilled workers from welders to civil engineers especially
4334392 maganda and kanilang mga sweldo at bukod doon ay yung pamilya nila madadala nila kaagad
4334393 for the last five years naga average tayo ng three percent increase sa deployment natin every year but this particular year 2008 mid year pa lang nasa 12 percent na ang increase natin this will be a continuing trend kasi ang demand nandoon pa din
4334394 possibly propping up the notion that overseas filipino workers may be conduits for terrorist funding or money laundering
4334395 food security in the philippines is projected to remain stable
4334396 ill be 32 the next time lots of young guys out there will be shooting at these spots in four years
4334397 when i first started i had no staff i got in at six and did all the baking before trying to open at 10 30am i could not get it done
4334398 i was working 20 22 hours a day it was insane my wife came in my 13 year old niece came in a buddy was in town from san francisco he was behind the counter for two days during his holiday
4334399 i would be here at six in the morning stay through until three or four in the morning go home eat breakfast shower maybe sleep an hour and then i would come back
4334400 one of the big factors behind why i gave up banking was less travel and more time at home with my kids right now i have even less time with them although that is starting to change
4334401 she taught me not just how to put it into a batter into a cup and into a pan but how to professionalise it scale this stuff up
4334402 how can you bake 3 000 to 6 000 cakes a day out of my kitchen and still maintain the quality when one day it is five degrees and 40 percent humidity and another it is 35 degrees and 98 percent humidity
4334403 ours stays soft for days it is a true italian buttercream they are beautiful
4334404 if you do not sell you do not get a bonus i just said at the end of the day this is not where i want to be
4334405 people who used to work with him cannot believe he has done it it takes a lot of guts to give up the pay cheque he has got the admiration and respect of his peer group
4334406 i dont miss it ever i dont even think about it except how can i get hold of my friends to buy cakes for their floor
4334407 we can make more money on mobile than we do on the desktop eventually
4334408 the launch of android is an important milestone in the industry
4334409 this process ensures we have an opportunity to receive feedback from users
4334410 commodity prices have entered a cyclical correction which looks like running a bit further
4334411 in the very short term commodities have become oversold and due for a bounce but the trend over the next six months or so is likely to remain down
4334412 find it harder to divert their exports away from the already weak us
4334413 worries about the international economic outlook and the implications of this for oil demand remained a damping influence on the oil price
4334414 the sale represents a good opportunity to enable the group to realise the value in the vessel and the cash flow generated will be available for deployment for the benefit of the group
4334415 they will eventually start cutting rates from the early part of next year and that will be a key factor which will contribute to more euro weakness
4334416 we probably have seen the top of the euro at 1 60
4334417 were not convinced that we will see any interest rate hikes in the us this year which will ultimately disappoint the markets
4334418 raising fears that this could force the fed to raise interest rates even while the economy was deteriorating
4334419 but ultimately more because of us problems we believe well see a move back below 110 to say 107 by around the end of the year
4334420 but i think both sides are comfortable where we are and it will get done
4334421 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4334422 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4334423 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4334424 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4334425 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4334426 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4334427 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4334428 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything

4334432 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4334433 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4334434 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4334443 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
4334444 its hard for the modern generation to understand thoreau who lived beside a pond but didnt own water skis or a snorkel
4334445 we do need a new economy but one that is founded on thrift and care on saving and conserving not on excess and waste an economy based on waste is inherently and hopelessly violent and war is its inevitable by product we need a peaceable economy
4334446 the more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe the less taste we shall have for destruction
4334447 the purpose of conservation the greatest good to the greatest number of people for the longest time
4334448 which sounds so neat and easy packaged into one run one sentence like that but which as anyone who has ever escaped fruitless angst and melodrama knows was anything but
4334449 in many ways i have become stronger and more compassionate in other ways i am weaker more fragile in a sense and afraid an oxymoron if there ever was fragile strength
4334450 sometimes you have to cry an emotional gut wrenching release so strong that in the end youre sobbing shakes your entire being

4334463 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4334464 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4334465 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
4334466 i understand where flight for life is coming from their decision makes sense but what about the health and safety of the people who reside in the project areas and that of those people driving through as well i have some real concerns

4334471 i felt really good but this is just the first half the second half will be after the gold medal match
4334472 the god of the old testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all of fiction jealous and proud of it a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic racist infanticidal genocidal filicidal pestilential megalomanical sadomasochistic capriciously malevolent bully those of us schooled from infancy in his ways can become desensitized to their horror
4334473 as an atheist youre part of a minority whose beliefs are constantly ignored and marginalised while religious prejudice is pandered to and encouraged and you have every right to be offended by that
4334474 the invisible and the non existent look very much alike
4334475 i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
4334476 its an incredible con job when you think about it to believe something now in exchange for something after death
4334477 it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
4334478 religious wars are basically people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend
4334479 the fruits of christianity were religious wars butcheries crusades inquisitions extermination of the natives of america and the introduction of african slaves in their place
4334480 just because science so far has failed to explain something such as consciousness to say it follows that the facile pathetic explanations which religion has produced somehow by default must win the argument is really quite ridiculous
4334481 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown if a form of theological lunacy
4334482 we would be 1 500 years ahead if it hadnt been for the church dragging science back by its coattails and burning our best minds at the stake
4334483 the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
4334484 the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox of old age or of anything else
4334485 the level of importance or magnitude assigned to a particular item
4334486 im somewhat concerned that now youve flipped on some of those maverick positions
4334487 when you came out and stated that you thought barack obama would rather lose a war to win an election i heard that as you calling him a traitor because thats what a member of the u s senate who would feel that way actually would be
4334488 do you think barack obama is a traitor do you still believe that he really would rather lose a war in order to lose an election if you do what makes you say that
4334489 what areas do you think i have changed my position
4334490 no no you said that i flip flopped on a number of issues id like to hear where that is
4334491 changed somewhat in an effort to appeal to your base
4334492 i believe in a very large republican party we have to be inclusive
4334493 ill continue a life that i hope is characterized by both redemption which i badly need and reconciliation
4334494 and sen obama said that the surge wouldnt work that it would fail he voted to cut off funding for the men and women serving in iraq he refuses to acknowledge that the surge is succeeding he announced after not being there for 900 days he announced his policy on iraq before left
4334495 i think hes wrong and i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party thats my answer to you
4334496 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4334497 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4334498 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4334499 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4334501 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4334502 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4334503 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4334504 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4334505 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4334506 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4334507 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4334508 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4334509 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4334510 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4334511 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4334512 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4334513 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4334514 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4334515 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4334516 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4334517 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4334518 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4334519 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4334520 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4334521 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4334522 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4334523 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4334524 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4334525 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4334526 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4334527 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4334528 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4334529 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4334530 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4334531 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4334532 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4334533 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4334534 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4334535 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4334536 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4334537 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4334538 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4334539 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4334540 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4334541 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4334542 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4334543 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4334544 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4334545 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4334546 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4334547 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4334548 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4334549 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4334550 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4334551 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4334552 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4334553 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4334554 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4334555 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4334556 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4334557 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4334558 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4334559 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4334560 do you know the lingo or are you born again
4334561 what is your world view and does your world view fit my world view
4334562 the not so secret formula for success is to identify and recruit the most talented faculty possible and then to provide them with the resources and environment to succeed
4334563 all components of the mission must be the best they can be we all think and act as one entity the emphasis is on quality not quantity
4334564 return to the ground for out of it you were taken you are dust and to dust you shall return
4334565 kita harus berani menerima kemenangan dan berani menerima kekalahan dengan kesatria serta menghargai ketertiban dan pranata hukum
4334566 tidak ada tempat bagi anarkhi demokrasi terlalu berharga untuk dinodai oleh anarkhi negara tidak boleh kalah dan tidak kalah dengan anarkhisme
4334567 hanya segelintir bangsa di dunia yang mendapat cobaan besar seperti bangsa kita dan hanya segelintir yang bisa keluar dari cobaan tersebut
4334568 they asked me why i wanted to be on the show i said i was frustrated with the dating scene in boston i also wanted to go to fenway its my favorite place in boston
4334569 i was interested in the experience it wasnt necessarily to get a date that would be a bonus
4334570 he said you should check it out i kinda blew him off he heckled me about it for weeks i started getting curious
4334571 they had a sign and they were chanting his name
4334572 you kind of have to watch what you say but i work well under pressure
4334573 im very adventurous i believe in living life to the fullest
4334574 if you asked him about the significance of running hed give you his life story thats what its like
4334575 it was certainly the highlight of my athletic career running across america and into fenway park
4334576 im very proud to be able to do this at 54 although im humbled to think 30 years ago i was banging these things out 80 days in a row
4334577 now just to get one done is an accomplishment at this age
4334578 the distance is not important but the message and the goals are
4334579 i wasnt going to do it this time especially because its very hard to take down an incumbent
4334580 this is going to be a word of mouth campaign
4334581 john mccain started receiving social security when he turned 65
4334582 but now he has a risky scheme to privatize social security threatening our benefits
4334583 i think we are talking about things that dont matter
4334584 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multi cultural country in spain
4334585 its so i can come home and be a nicer momma dont you want momma to be nicer
4334586 it will be appealed it doesnt mean anything what really matters is what the last ruling is not the first
4334587 i think its a lot of vindication for what we have been talking about since april
4334588 state revenues generating an equivalent hold harmless amount for schools
4334589 the limitation on the implementation of the hold harmless amount is a material fact of which the voter must be given notice if the title and summary are to meet the constitutional requirement that the voter be given fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4334590 i dont think theres anything constitutionally wrong with mixing things
4334591 but they raised the bar by having to explain it
4334592 with 25 members and with everyone having different ideas and with certain people in the group wanting to make sure his gets in its very difficult to get meaningful language in an amendment summary with 75 words or less
4334593 homeownership is a fundamental right and floridians deserve a say on how their property is taxed
4334594 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property tax rates
4334595 whats happened in the last 40 50 years is that human activity has made the water quality conditions worse
4334596 tend to occur in areas that are historically prime fishing grounds
4334597 we are in the midst of a human trafficking epidemic
4334598 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4334599 degrade and burn up on re entry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4334600 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4334601 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and firsthand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work
4334602 sometimes in spite of himself he finds himself involved in policy matters by superiors who wish to take advantage of his name
4334603 it really was overextending with a plan that was designed to provide a lot of benefits for a sick population
4334604 this was spent providing benefits to eligible people a lot of ill people have derived benefits
4334605 our staff was capable but in the end we were not good enough
4334606 its not going to be straightened out by october the start of the 2008 09 fiscal year but its going to be straighter
4334607 i know a lot of people are in the same situation im in
4334608 if youre politely or aggressively angry at us you should be
4334609 we did not do an excellent job thats for sure i think we did the best job we could with what we had to work with
4334610 with the probable elimination of the community outreach grants we are facing the very real possibility of not being able to keep the haley center functioning
4334611 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4334612 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4334613 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4334614 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4334615 commodity prices have entered a cyclical correction which looks like running a bit further
4334616 in the very short term commodities have become oversold and due for a bounce but the trend over the next six months or so is likely to remain down
4334617 find it harder to divert their exports away from the already weak us
4334618 worries about the international economic outlook and the implications of this for oil demand remained a damping influence on the oil price
4334619 i know that the one thing that is certain about the process is that it is unpredictable i entered into it as a person who was cautiously optimistic but not presumptuous
4334620 it may well be that politics being like it is may have some influence
4334621 but ive always taken the position that those judicial nominating commissions also look objectively and not with political views
4334622 i think he would be well qualified i think the experience he had on the 2nd district court of appeal will be useful to him as well as his legislative experience
4334623 he has a great demeanor and is very knowledgeable about the law when ive appeared before him i thought he asked the right questions and knew the issues and was well prepared
4334624 this is kind of a no lose proposition for me
4334625 if i go to the supreme court ill be grateful for that if that doesnt work out ill be grateful for the continued opportunity to serve on the 2nd district court of appeal
4334626 many studies show that females are more likely to carry out the majority of home duties within a family household so it makes sense that setting up running and growing their own business is an attractive option
4334627 the concept of working to live rather than living to work continues to build in importance for australian women
4334628 were not going to speculate on the number of layoffs
4334629 i think layoffs will be on the table and i think it will be a significant number although no specific number was thrown out
4334630 people are going to the suburbs because of the county sales tax increase and people are buying off the internet too
4334631 si nosotros nos hacemos esa foto nos echan de los juegos
4334632 vamos a putear a todo vasallo que no cante el
4334633 necesitan eliminar la injusticia de todos los territorios del planeta
4334634 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4334635 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4334636 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
4334637 its impossible that government lawyers wont be able to answer questions about the moa since they prepared it
4334638 they will eventually start cutting rates from the early part of next year and that will be a key factor which will contribute to more euro weakness
4334639 we probably have seen the top of the euro at 1 60
4334640 were not convinced that we will see any interest rate hikes in the us this year which will ultimately disappoint the markets
4334641 raising fears that this could force the fed to raise interest rates even while the economy was deteriorating
4334642 but ultimately more because of us problems we believe well see a move back below 110 to say 107 by around the end of the year
4334643 no he sabido estar a la altura estaba para lanzar 20 metros y medio
4334644 retirada me lo voy a plantear a o a a o no me hab a llevado una decepci n tan grande en muchos a os

4334647 there are really no shortcuts to being a good cook you have to cook a piece of fish a thousand times before you get it you really have to put in the time
4334648 people want to do it the quick way but it takes a long time before its about you i found it calming peeling the carrots i enjoyed cleaning the fish

4334696 clip aaron u turn lili paroles aaron u turn lili clipbox
4334697 obviously i think just as a professional ive matured a little bit and ive learned a lot more since my rookie year and i think thats a good thing and just from a football standpoint i think were both willing to win and were ready to do that and were just looking it as an opportunity here i think we both can be fresh in the game at all times and kind of wear the defense down and have an opportunity to do something special
4334698 really where i am right now is i think i have a pretty good feeling for what theyll do in a game
4334699 obviously i want to get them a little bit more work this week than i did last week
4334700 last week ronnie started the game and we got him a couple touches early in the game but theres ricky kind of champing at the bit to get in the game and i wasnt sure how he would enter well id seen him enter the game with a little bit of energy and a little bit of life to him i know in dallas that was marion barbers role he came into the game and he brought life that way so im kind of interested to see that in the next couple weeks who can get the team started and who can come in off the bench and provide energy
4334701 theyre always going to look at the way ronnie and i work and theyre going to try to learn from that but were just a group of guys having fun together
4334702 were just running backs thats it we try to keep it simple
4334703 were just excited about being out here and for myself im excited coming off of an injury and being able to be back out there on the field and i think for him hes excited just to be back in there i think were both like little kids were out there trying to learn and just hopping around and just enjoying it and taking it one day at the time i think thats the main thing
4334704 obviously its going to take a lot of things that play into that role were going to have to convert on third downs keep the ball and try to keep the defense off the field and just run the ball pretty well i think if we do that then weve got an opportunity as long as we continue to push each other and go out and compete
4334705 a receiver and a db fighting i dont think thats much of a fight sometimes
4334706 things happened so fast out there i didnt see how the play went but obviously ive spoken to both players
4334707 the bottom line is were trying to teach good discipline in games and that can cost you a player in a game in a critical situation and you dont want that somebody can get hurt somebody can get ejected and whatever the case might be its not what you want so its not what were trying to do
4334708 i was in the middle of a fight with a player and i was coaching the offensive line and at the time this fight was going on out there and a couple guys were swinging and i didnt know any better i thought it was college and i kind of dove in the middle of it and i think i caught a right hand in the face
4334709 the next thing you know i came out of there like i was shot out of a cannon and the players were all laughing at me
4334710 i remember turning around and at the time ray perkins was working for us and he was coaching the tight ends and rays a tremendous guy and he looked at me and he said well son did you learn something yeah i got it coach i dont know if i stopped the fight i dont remember i got hit in the face it was orlando brown thats a big right hand
4334711 jangan dok kemaruk 16 september runtuhkan kerajaan jahiliah lama umno diganti dengan kerajaan jahiliah

4334719 tepat pada tahun 2008 ini maka genaplah 60 tahun berlaku peristiwa nakbah iaitu peristiwa malapetaka ke atas rakyat palestin pada tahun 1948 tentera zionis israel telah melancarkan pembersihan etnik iaitu sejumlah 750 000 orang atau tiga perempat daripada rakyat palestin dihalau keluar dari kediaman mereka
4334720 the sprawl of unfettered newspaper boxes presents an eyesore and to some degree a public nuisance
4334721 is unreasonably broad unenforceable provides no administrative appeal process puts the nation at a competitive disadvantage and fails to address the real problem on the navajo nation of underage smoking
4334722 air shared with all beings and things of the earth
4334723 im afraid the law can be construed to mean no commercial tobacco use for religious ceremonies if so this will subject those attending the religious ceremony as well as the practitioners to liability for allowing the use of commercial tobacco in bona fide religious ceremonies this was not the intent of the legislation but would be the effect
4334724 theres already a collection of tobacco products tax thats already in place as of sept 30 2007 there was approximately 153 000 in that line item
4334725 compounding this problem the legislation allows any citizen to register an oral or written complaint to initiate enforcement
4334726 that raises serious concerns about the burden of proof required in matters involving civil penalties
4334727 currently district courts are dealing with family issues commercial issues crime juvenile crime what are we going to do say here we want you to hold a trial to deal with a smoker
4334728 this means essentially that navajo jobs will be cut the enterprise will default on the loan with the nation and the ability to seek outside financing from other lending institutions is very unlikely all of which would likely prohibit the development of additional gaming establishments
4334729 as leaders of the navajo nation and upon the peoples approval of gaming we have worked together and made very deliberate choices to pursue gaming for the benefit of our people
4334730 the revenue generating potential is huge and we simply cannot afford to risk this potential with well intended legislation that will put the nation at a competitive disadvantage
4334731 our music is definitely music but its got that east coast flavor from atlantic canada its a mixture of traditional irish scottish inuit and american because they americans used to be at goose bay said the flummies guitarist and vocalist leander baikie

4334734 a woman wants that wrinkle gone but if she has an option to go organic she will choose that
4334735 pretty quickly after i put it on the market i wanted packaging that expressed who i am
4334736 if i were walking into a store i would want something sophisticated innovative and simple that addresses treatment needs
4334737 how the hell did frank miller fit all of that crazy in to 9 issues
4334738 i felt really relaxed out there kept the nerves in check and tried not to do anything stupid and just bided my time
4334739 i thought the gap wasnt going to appear and i was just squeezing through i did get bumped and even drew blood on a cut finger
4334740 what he had really come to hunt was their spirit rocks and to hear about how they go to the spirits to find out whos been causing them all their bad luck and put a curse on that person or find out what they have to do to appease them these beliefs are centuries old and even today many budik people cling to those rituals
4334741 its something that takes a lifetime to learn and we arent always putting our best foot forward but we do know how good it is when we do let the lord have his way in our lives and so we really want that for our lives
4334742 but a lot of the budik believers dont even know how fantastic it could be here on this earth not materially but inside them when walking in step with the lord
4334743 mmhmm it looks great on me you should see it
4334744 the outfits f fine b but y you should g get o off me

4334752 it is not in the inanbimali culture to give hugs and so i just think that she was emotionally and physically exhausted and needed someone to be with her

4334754 its growth how we focus on quality growth quality neighborhoods and the kinds of communities to leave as legacies to the next generation

4334756 the most ambitious energy conservation goal 20 percent by 2015 of practically any state in america
4334757 dates to 1922 the time of the treaty of versailles
4334758 headed toward disastrous results in the absence of decisive steps
4334759 people living in the shadows of society waking up fearful for themselves and their families
4334760 in my opinion the need to pass a safe haven bill outweighed the need for perfect language
4334761 the risk to babies lives far outweighed the possibility of a few inconvenient circumstances with older children
4334762 its a clear indication that there are some things that we all agree are critically important
4334763 we love and value the lives of our babies we will do what it takes to keep them safe and healthy
4334764 the evidence is they have not and are not solving the problem they went out to solve
4334765 there has to be education out there that says what kind of help you can get instead of just abandoning a child
4334766 we dont want people to stop relinquishing children for adoption but we want them to do it the right way
4334767 the law is two sentences long its not a simple matter when you start taking a 5 or 10 year old you need to get some help somewhere
4334768 but we were really concerned about newborns i hope parents wont drop off teens
4334769 if you open the door to that you open the door to all kinds of unintended consequences what does that have to do with the problem of infant abandonment
4334770 declaring victory and moving on isnt the way to do public policy
4334771 its a done deal i accept that but we need to not put the issue to rest we havent found a complete answer
4334772 we tease him and he goes im a little bit fatigued like we all are but i say yeah but youre old
4334773 its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what were sticking to
4334774 usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps that would probably be somewhere around it but i dont have it set
4334775 theres been a lot going on and theres been a lot of things hes had to get acclimated to whether its finding the lunch room or learning the playbook or studying film and all that stuff
4334776 hes doing a really really good job im really pleased
4334777 he looks the same because everyone out here is kind of tired and beat up right now physically and mentally
4334778 so we dont even notice it maybe someone that comes in here with fresh legs would notice it but none of us do
4334779 he looks like brett and all that aura around him and how he throws the ball thats all true hes looking great and i just know that hes played for so long and knows how to take care of his body whenever one comes my way i just try to catch what i can
4334780 i think he sees the play but sometimes it doesnt come off his tongue maybe as fast as he wants it to because hes doing it one way for a long time but you definitely see him making strides
4334781 before when you had to repeat it two or three times now you do it one time and he looks at you and goes yeah ive got that
4334782 a lot of playing the position is you see something
4334783 hes always had a good feel for solving problems he might not be able to put it in our terminology but he knows ive got a problem over there and im going to bail myself out over here thats where he and the players have started to develop a really good feel for signals and things like that when youre dealing with a smart guy who has played as much as he has theres really not much he hasnt seen
4334784 i think the gunslinger tag is maybe a little bit unfair because hes got a great feel for whats going on
4334785 and just sitting around and watching film with him or talking to him during the course of practice hell say hey i saw this guy push over on the back side vs cover 4 i knew i was singled over there thats something some quarterbacks have some quarterbacks dont he definitely has that ability to see things
4334786 theres a lot of rumors in this business john will be at practice today
4334787 im heading out to job hunt a bit whats up with you
4334788 well hello my name is my name how old are you
4334789 haha im actually gay and youre a dude youre stupid
4334790 it doesnt matter if it is sturdy as long as it looks good
4334791 he has indicated he is not a rich man and cant live abroad
4334792 we hope that in the interest of the good of pakistan and for the good of the country that mr musharraf takes the right course and resigns before the impeachment process begins
4334793 official action has to be taken by him and he has not yet taken the action
4334794 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4334795 when you come across something like this it sends a tingle up your spine
4334796 i have never seen such an exceptional site as gobero it is actually eight sites where people not only buried their dead but actually lived as well
4334797 choose the right apple dont peel it and add nothing more than sugar and water its that simple
4334798 who does remember when i got bit back before we crossed the platte
4334799 degenen die naar het spreekuur komen zijn recentelijk allemaal al eens hier geweest
4334800 ze hebben een operatie ondergaan of zijn op een andere manier behandeld daarom moeten ze vaak nog terugkomen voor controle
4334801 tijdens het spreekuur zetten we onder meer nieuw gips kunnen er r ntgenfotos worden gemaakt verschonen we wonden en verwijderen we hechtingen
4334802 we laten een pati nt pas gaan als we er zeker van zijn dat ie voldoende is hersteld of voor verdere verzorgingin het ziekenhuis van tarin kowt kan worden geholpen
4334803 de bevolking kan in principe twee keer per week terecht op het afghanenspreekuur maar de afgelopen tijd hebben we soms wel vijf keer per week de poli opengegooid om iedereen te kunnen helpen
4334804 drie jaar geleden heeft hij dit gebroken waarna hij in pakistan is geopereerd
4334805 daarbij heeft hij zijn bovenarm gebroken en een scheurtje opgelopen in de pols die pols is inmiddels goed geheeld dus het gips mag eraf
4334806 ik vind het wel wat hebben je weet meestal niet van te voren wie er gaat komen tot ze daadwerkelijk in de wachtkamer zitten blijft het onzeker of de pati nten wel komen opdagen
4334807 tijd is voor de afghanen nog een redelijk vaag begrip soms moeten we pati nten uitleggen dat de zon zeven keer op en onder moet zijn geweest voordat ze voor controle weer terug moeten komen
4334808 een van de redenen kan zijn dat de mannen zich over het algemeen veel meer op straat en dus in de gevarenzone begeven met meer risico om gewond te raken
4334809 vorig jaar gaven ze mij zelden een hand en keken me ook niet aan als ik met ze sprak nu wordt er regelmatig een hand naar mij uitgestoken om me te bedanken
4334810 ik heb het nog niet meegemaakt dat een mannelijke pati nt weigerde zich door mij te laten behandelen in het verleden zorgde dat nog weleens voor problemen maar kennelijk zijn ze er inmiddels aan gewend dat er in het nederlandse leger vrouwen zitten
4334811 ik vraag nooit of ze wel door een vrouw behandeld willen worden je moet gewoon meteen met ze aan de slag gaan
4334812 krijgen we plotseling meerdere spoedgevallen binnen dan worden alle zeilen bijgezet en wordt het afghanenspreekuur tijdelijk stilgelegd
4334813 de laatste keer dat hij het spreekuur bezocht wilde hij niet geloven dat zijn hand er echt af was
4334814 toen schold hij de hele boel bij elkaar en wilde totaal niet luisteren
4334815 opvallend is dat er veel mensen met botbreuken tussen zitten
4334816 er is hier toch wat minder sociale controle over de kinderen dan bij ons in nederland in tarin kowt rennen ze allemaal zo de weg op met verkeersongelukken tot gevolg
4334817 gek genoeg vallen er veel slachtoffers door toedoen van een eigen familielid
4334818 onlangs werd er nog een pati nt binnengebracht die door zijn neef was bewerkt met een bijl hij had er een flinke wond aan zijn schouder aan overgehouden je komt hier echt van alles tegen ik sta eigenlijk nergens meer van te kijken

4334843 maar ik was na de eerste stoot wel meteen overtuigd dat het genoeg zou zijn voor de finale ik zag iedereen stoeien met de kwalificatie eis
4334844 dat was een gok maar als ik nog eerder was opgestaan had je me voor de finale kunnen opvegen uiteraard had ik het liefst de kwalificatie eis in mijn eerste poging gehaald en was ik meteen daarna teruggegaan naar het olympisch dorp maar dat zat er niet in het belangrijkste is echter dat ik me heb gekwalificeerd

4334859 it is really a shame that europeans who have powerful construction and energy companies speak the language of the people and are accustomed to working in africa hiring locals did not offer an exchange similar to the chinese

4334898 so on its face it includes two subjects and inconsistent subjects too its what i call a wolf in sheeps clothing its couched as the schools first elementary and secondary funding initiative when what you have is more of a law dealing with the cap on licenses and eliminating the loss limits

4335059 wow you really know alot about this technology do you or did you work for att at one point
4335060 listen percy i know youve always been focussed on your career and i understand why you were quick to accept fudges lies weve never really gotten on well so i dont really blame you for believing him so if youre apologising to me for that then fine i accept
4335061 honestly percy you really are a complete git you turned your back on your own family what the hell is wrong with you dyou know what id give to have grown up with a family even half as good as yours
4335062 all right percy this is what were going to do im going to accept that you want to be a weasley again and treat you like one and youre going to bloody well act like one because it wont be fred and georges pranks youll be worrying about if you dont i wont let you hurt them again
4335063 what gives you the right to determine whether i am accepted by my family again
4335064 i never said i had that right i merely said you will regret hurting them like that if it ever happens again
4335065 whether it pleases you or not understand that they are the closest thing i have ever had to a family and the pain they went through because of your arrogance will not happen again you are as much a part of my family as the rest of them and your actions hurt us all not just mum and dad
4335066 and i can only hope that my own children will not be as cruel to me as i was to my parents
4335067 and what exactly am i supposed to do with this
4335068 ginny dear it is not what you do with it that matters it is what harry does that is so important
4335069 dont you think that it is a little early father
4335070 normally i would say yes but this once i am indulging in a couple of shots of firewhisky
4335071 i find myself a bit nervous because i want today to be the best it can possibly be for your sister but we had very little time to plan this and there are still so many things that can go wrong
4335072 are you sure about this father are you sure they should be getting married this young
4335073 yes percy i am sure this is the right thing to do if your worry is about the upcoming ritual we searched for weeks and found no other means of finishing this your mother has expressed her feelings on the subject we have exhausted every possible option but the ritual
4335074 now as for the marriage your mother and i have discussed it repeatedly and we feel that it is the best thing for both of them i know youre worried about ginnys feelings and the familys reputation and i also know your apprehensions about harry however this really is the best possible choice in this situation
4335075 father my main worry is if they truly understand the pain ginny will suffer through if the ritual fails
4335076 i know it really isnt my place to make the decision but surely you have your own reservations about this
4335077 yes percy but try to understand your mother and i feel this is the best choice both of them seem happy and this way ginny gets her childhood dreams fulfilled she understands she will lose him soon but she is strong and willing to accept that as a consequence of her choices
4335078 i understand now father i still dont like it but i understand your decision
4335079 now what advice did you have for your brothers who are about to lose their bachelorhood
4335080 i told them to run as fast as possible and maybe the two witches would let them live if they stayed out of sight for a long enough period of time ron looked as if he would die of fright but bill just laughed and reminded me that fleur is one quarter veela and he did not want to get her that angry with him
4335081 i think bill knows you too well son well it looks like everything is set you should get to your seat
4335082 i tried to warn him not to have exotic dancers at the party but he was the best man and thought he knew better lily trusted james and sirius about as far as she could throw hogwarts two of her friends were there in disguise and the hexes lily put on james and sirius the next morning had the rest of us laughing for days afterward
4335083 i often wondered why lily ever took pity on james so quickly she released him from the hex she had placed on him during the reception sirius on the other hand had to wait for a whole two weeks for them to return from their honeymoon i guess we should be thankful too or young harry would not be sitting here beside me to listen to this story
4335084 last chance to turn back and change your mind are you really sure you want to go through with this
4335085 in fact i have never been this sure of anything in my life hes finally going to be all mine
4335086 as these two have joined their hearts and lives so let these wands never be used by their owners against each other in anger or hatred you may now share your first kiss as husband and wife
4335087 these two have requested to exchange their own vows of love before the final commitment following that i will perform the ring and wand binding ginevra if you would begin
4335088 harry james potter i ginevra molly weasley hereby offer to you my body my mind my heart my soul and my magic for now and for eternity my body i offer to you as friend lover and wife that i may be the mother of your children my mind i offer for the knowledge and wisdom i bring to our union my heart i offer so you know i will always love you my soul i offer that we may be together always and my magic i offer that i may give you all of myself
4335089 ginevra molly weasley i harry james potter accept the offering you make here and in so doing i hereby offer you my body my mind my heart my soul and my magic for now and for eternity my body i offer as friend lover husband protector and provider my mind i offer for the knowledge and wisdom i can bring to our union my heart i offer as the proof that you are the only person for me my soul i offer that we may be together always my magic i offer that i may give you all of myself and to seal our pact of love
4335090 harry james potter i ginevra molly weasley accept the offering you make here may our love be eternal
4335091 as this wizard and witch have pledged their lives to one another let them never use their wands in anger against one another you may now share your first kiss as husband and wife
4335092 i now present to you mr remus and mrs dora lupin mr william and mrs fleur weasley mr ronald and mrs hermione weasley mr neville and mrs luna longbottom and mr harry and mrs ginevra potter
4335093 um a little uncomfortable but i will get used to it now we need to talk about a few things okay
4335094 actually the very first thing i need to do is go to the loo
4335095 harry there are things that you need to understand about me before you go back
4335096 first i am sure that you remember how i was always blushing and ducking out of the room the truth of it is that i was a very outgoing person except when you were around i was so afraid that i would say something wrong and you would never like me that i tried to avoid you as much as possible
4335097 well you will need to help get me past that as quickly as possible
4335098 was there any reason that you can think of to help me with a solution to this situation
4335099 i think if we are able to share something special early i will be able to overcome my embarrassment of being around you you will have to do something to help me get over it as quickly as possible
4335100 i was very self conscious about my physical development at that time among other things i thought that i was too small to do what the older girls were doing i felt very limited and unable to um well impress you
4335101 i can certainly think of a few things to help with that problem and since i definitely need to be able to talk with you sooner i will try very hard to befriend you and make you feel more comfortable around me
4335102 good i think that will go a long way towards helping us get together quicker
4335103 second is the train ride at the start of your third year
4335104 yeah i cant say which hurt more ron telling me to go away or you not saying anything to him about it
4335105 harry why didnt you say something it had only been three months since the chamber i needed a friend so badly and though hermione was kind to me and tried to be mine ron my closest brother in age didnt want me anywhere around him
4335106 and you were a hopeless case it was two years after that before you finally decided to really talk to me again
4335107 thats the point you were always there for ron or hermione but never me
4335108 you never even acted like you knew i was alive
4335109 what changed between us what was so wrong with me that you took so long to notice me
4335110 ginny from the time i first met you you have been the person i most fancied and yes i know that it took me years to understand the feelings i have for you yes i tried to find other girls to share my time with before you and i started being friends but then you always seemed to have someone special in your life while i was alone
4335111 did you know that i can still remember the first words you ever spoke to me and though you may not have thought of this you were the first person my own age to ever speak kindly to me
4335112 are you afraid my feelings for you arent real did you not hear the words we spoke yesterday i could no more hurt you than i could cut out my own heart
4335113 so many times i thought we were finally going to get together and then something happened and i was left wondering why you didnt notice how i was looking at you or how i felt about you
4335114 i missed so much that could have made us both happier and i am extremely sorry about that i must say though that i dont think you are completely blameless in our relationship missteps either
4335115 you really need to understand more about me and realise that i am not just one of those girls who worships you like a god or something
4335116 harry though it still seems hard for me to believe for better or worse i am your wife what were we talking about
4335117 about how we were both being idiots these last few years
4335118 you will definitely have to invite me to the yule ball your fourth year before neville can ask me it was at that point that i actually began to give up on there ever being an us
4335119 i cried for an hour when i realised that i had missed out on a chance to go as your date to the ball that christmas i was so sure that you would never want me hermione told me to be patient but how could i be when i had just missed what was likely to be my one real chance
4335120 mate i know you are going back to correct a mistake that left you marrying ginny too late but could you find the opportunity to get hermione and me together sooner if possible she and i have only been married for one day and i dont know how i ever got along without her
4335121 yeah ron i think i can try to do that
4335122 any particular method you want me to use to get the two of you together sooner or should i just lock the two of you in a cupboard during the winter holidays our third year and not let you out until you have both snogged for at least an hour
4335123 that sounds like it might work with the two of us back then
4335124 hermione you said that you would explain the different colours yesterday
4335125 when remus and dora kissed also bill and fleur for that matter they were surrounded by a soft white orb of light
4335126 yes that is normal at a magical wedding from everything i have read it is caused by the merging of the couples magic
4335127 but for you and ron and then neville and luna the orb had other colours in it like red gold blue and black what do those mean
4335128 well red represents courage and blue is for intelligence and truth
4335129 the gold is often a symbol of wisdom and fertility the black is a little worrisome because it normally symbolizes death but could also symbolize stability
4335130 harry you and ginny had the most spectacular auroral display of the day it consisted of every colour imaginable and it lasted for an hour after your kiss ended
4335131 the most prominent colour was white but all of them were very strongly present
4335132 red blue gold and black we have already discussed but there was also pink symbolizing love brown symbolizing order and orange symbolizing vitality with endurance
4335133 then there is yellow symbolizing joy happiness and intellectual energy green symbolizing life fertility and well being purple symbolizing magic and mystery
4335134 of course indigo symbolizes intuition while white symbolizes purity virtue and cleanliness and finally there is grey which symbolizes security maturity and humility
4335135 master pettigrew has most definitely failed in the task you gave him as you already know potter is alive and we can only assume that this means pettigrew is dead what little information he managed to get out to us indicates that they were searching for a means of sending a message or messenger back to the past in order to alter the outcome of your battle with potter
4335136 i think we should arrange a surprise visit for them master
4335137 as do i draco as do i i shall plan one for later this month you are all dismissed
4335138 master harry master harry you is needing to wake up now
4335139 master harry you and mistress ginny must get out of bed now your mud err muggle born friend says you needing to prepare for the ritual kreacher has already laid out clothes for master and mistress kreacher will return to the kitchens now to prepare your breakfast
4335140 oh baby please let me sleep im too tired for that now
4335141 while i would dearly love to be doing that also ginny dearest we are needed and should be getting dressed so we can get on with the day
4335142 oh harry i want to sleep and so do you
4335143 harry james potter i am going to do worse than hex you if you dont let me get some sleep
4335144 we need to get ready for today we have much to do and very little time left to do it
4335145 i wish we could stay together forever but that is what i am doing this for isnt it
4335146 what is you doing with good master reguluss locket he is leaving it for the dark lord to find why is you having it
4335147 kreacher what happened to the locket you were given to destroy
4335148 kreacher was unable to do as master regulus had commanded so i is placing it in the drawing room master sirius wanted it thrown out kreacher rescued it and took it to his den where it was stolen by mundungus fletcher along with many important family heirlooms kreacher is not knowing where it was taken
4335149 we are trying to destroy that item ourselves however dung was in azkaban when it was opened by tom and his followers thank you kreacher you have made it possible to fulfil reguluss last command to you but not in this life i am afraid
4335150 i am sorry kreacher but with mundungus likely dead it is most likely that tom has the locket back in his possession but you may have this one
4335151 i will take care of that problem for both of us the next time around
4335152 oh no is master harry going to use time magic
4335153 i must do it for many reasons including this one
4335154 master harry kreacher will serve you and your mistress ginny willingly but i is still thinking that you is a worthless blood traitor however you is doing your best to do what you can to help kreacher so kreacher will serve you willingly
4335155 you is not eating enough you is needing to eat more
4335156 harry there is one more thing we must take care of before you can attempt this ritual
4335157 as you can all see harrys scar is what is known as a horcrux it will need to be destroyed before harry can succeed in his attempt at the time ritual
4335158 professor why is that necessary hes leaving his body behind to go back in time so would it affect anything either way
4335159 mrs weasley a horcrux will use every means at its disposal to survive it is attached to harrys body so it must be destroyed or it will prevent harry from dying to complete the ritual
4335160 horace you will need to aim very carefully and harry you must lie absolutely still
4335161 hermione place the full body bind on me please it will make it easier to not move at all
4335162 there are only a few ways that are known methods of dealing with a horcrux mrs potter the only option available to us however that can still leave harry a chance of survival is to use a basilisk fang on the scar directly it couldnt be performed before the end of his fourth year because tom riddle in searching for a method to escape death managed to provide a means of keeping him alive if he wished to remain so voldemort accidentally made killing him nearly impossible
4335163 i have already witnessed this to insure that mr potter will survive to complete the ritual
4335164 you should all recognize this time turner which mrs hermione weasley used in her third year to attend all of her classes i kept it in case it would ever be needed now horace if you would please
4335165 harry you need to return so we can do the ritual it was necessary to destroy the horcrux please come back or i will let you deal with the angry redhead to whom you are married i think it would be better here where she can be placated than waiting for her to follow you to the next great adventure
4335166 im coming headmaster give me a minute or two to make sure everything is working in here
4335167 it is done mrs potter he needs a little encouragement to return to us
4335168 harry come back to me i need you here with me now please return please
4335169 excuse me mrs potter i need to do a revealing charm on harry and then you may have him back
4335170 mr potter i can say without a doubt that the horcrux inhabiting your scar is most definitely gone
4335171 now that we have that taken care of harry i am sure you have certain things that others have asked you to do for them but you must remember not to let your younger self change too much or your memories will do him no good
4335172 i was wondering how much of a change do you think harry will be able to make
4335173 i am unsure mrs potter however i will venture an opinion that the less mr potter tries to change the easier he will find things for guiding his younger self any major changes he is planning to make and the longer he waits to make them the better it will be for him in the long term
4335174 that was my earlier self leaving to continue the little situation i started
4335175 you did say that you saw this happen to insure it would work
4335176 well sis what is it that i need to do
4335177 i am not that bad ronald and you know it
4335178 hermione love try to understand that i have known you long enough to know when you are going into lecture mode
4335179 you get this twinkle in your eyes that resemble two little suns flashing and they are like two signs saying teach instruct repeatedly
4335180 i know you and ron want to get on with your foreplay but i need you to remind me of everything i am supposed to do today
4335181 harry you need to listen very carefully these instructions must be followed exactly
4335182 you will need to stand here and using this knife slit open your hand
4335183 then you will have to let three drops of blood fall on each rune in this specific order
4335184 starting with this one which indicates justice and proceeding through mercy compassion love honour peace integrity truth wisdom fate passion and ending here with time
4335185 finally you will need to recite the following words twelve times i do plead with kronos lord of time to find me worthy of a key to my past that i may heal what has been broken
4335186 i do plead with kronos lord of time to find me worthy of a key
4335187 i would probably foul everything up if i dont have this
4335188 love i must say that i would feel better if you would go with penny and guard th
4335189 if you finish that thought this ritual will be of no use to us because you will be unable to complete it through the pain you will be feeling i am not a child who needs to be protected from the worst parts of life i am your wife and that means i stand by your side through the good and the bad now i am staying with you until the end and that is final
4335190 this will not be a pleasant thing but if that is your decision i wont try to dissuade you further the truth is i think that i will feel better if i have you here near me
4335191 sir you advised me to be careful what i change in order to preserve my memories for as long as possible but as we have discussed it is the little things that if changed will lead to something better
4335192 i aim to make small changes along the way rather than one or two big ones at the end of the opportunity hopefully to be provided by this ritual
4335193 ron and hermione both asked that they be encouraged but not forced to get together as soon as possible i will begin to do so at the first opportunity
4335194 i am unsure what revealing peter sooner will accomplish but i will try to make things easier on sirius but do so as quietly as possible
4335195 i know enough to plan very carefully how when and where to make the most of each situation i will face in getting our younger selves together i should have only minor amounts of trouble convincing myself of your importance but once that is done it will be full steam ahead
4335196 now love we need to get a last few hours for ourselves before the end
4335197 i advise against making those changes harry but if that is your plan then i will leave you with a code word to give my younger self to insure you are accepted for who you are
4335198 his voice was amplified throughout the school as he announced
4335199 this may very well be the attack i have feared for many months it will take him a few hours to break through the wards especially after the way they were strengthened by yours and ginnys bonding kiss you should have the time you need to perform this ritual good luck harry please try to remember two things the first is that no matter how bad things get they can always be worse the second is that no matter how unloved you feel there are always those that love and care for you who want the best for you above all else oh one more thing love is truly the strongest emotion magic can call upon remember who you love and why and you should have little difficulty achieving your goals
4335200 there are still a few preparations we need to make before the ritual we have best get started these should take a couple of hours i hope the wards hold until we can finish
4335201 i wish we could have done this earlier but the instructions say that these have to be inscribed on the day the ritual is performed
4335202 what usually happens to those stupid enough to endanger the young of large predators is they rarely live to tell the tale moreover those that do live seldom have a night where they sleep without horrifying nightmares as they relive the attack in their dreams
4335203 very funny potter oh and just so you know the next generation of potters is growing inside of me as we speak
4335204 another red haired mother dying to protect potter too little too late
4335205 harry you must complete this ritual no matter what i will see you on the other side
4335206 so that is how she planned to help me in this war i really wish she had told me it might have been fun to learn to be animagi together i wonder if she forgot to tell me that particular secret or if there is more we still have to learn about each other
4335207 when did she have the time to learn that trick anyway
4335208 everyone you sent to protect you is dead harry except your young friend here and she will only live long enough to entertain my death eaters at the victory celebration tonight
4335209 i am never going to lose you no matter what i must do
4335210 harry james potter we are here to welcome you to the next great adventure please follow us
4335211 of all european summer music festivals the bayreuth festival may be the hardest ticket
4335212 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4335213 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4335214 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4335215 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4335216 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays
4335217 routinely given to advance science and treatments for the benefit of patients
4335218 a lot of the experts are turned to by industry for consulting
4335219 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4335220 i am very disappointed at what has happened but i would do the same again
4335221 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt
4335222 this womans compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief
4335223 try ing to pay attention to the language weve all agreed upon

4335230 dont get scared but you blacked out for a few seconds
4335231 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4335232 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4335233 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4335234 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4335235 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4335236 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4335237 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4335238 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4335239 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts
4335240 its not the marijuana thats dangerous for me its the chocolate to which i could easily become addicted again
4335241 should i set up a graduate scholarship for jewish americans i feel really bad for all of the jewish people

4335285 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4335286 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4335287 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america
4335288 they are like a police department on campus and no one dares cross them
4335289 they fear undergraduates would form a formidable political movement that would challenge the status quo
4335290 our stand is that the university law should be abolished and replaced with a new university act that protects undergraduate basic rights
4335291 the university law has been used to curb student activism ever since it was enacted in 1971 to curb freedom of expression and freedom of association
4335292 we dont want to be cheated by cosmetic changes of the law
4335293 all proposed changes must be fully made public so that everyone can give crucial feedback
4335294 however the time has come for the authorities to allow students to participate in political activities

4335316 gandhis penchant for entrusting nehru with all major political responsibilities had less to do with nehrus political ability and more to do with nehrus sagacity in staying on the right side of gandhi it was gandhis moha for nehru which drove a stake into the heart of the hindu nation in 1946 when gandhi subordinated the nations interest to nehrus personal whim in jammu and kashmir even as the inc was in the midst of the make or break negotiations with the cabinet delegation trouble erupted in jammu and kashmir sheikh abdullah a commoner from the valley saw a great opportunity in the generally troubled times to realize his own towering muslim ambitions in the turbulent years preceding 1947 playing out the drama for civil liberties and freedom that the inc had staged in rajkot jaipur and other hindu kingdoms sheikh abdullah launched in may 1946 the quit kashmir campaign abdullah was promptly arrested and incarcerated nehru playing the great democrat to the hilt attempted to enter kashmir and was also speedily detained by ramachandra kak the prime minister of jammu and kashmir gandhi jumped into the fray and in a passionate letter to jawaharlal nehru pleaded with nehru to return to delhi with the promise that the congress would make nehrus cause in kashmir its own cause and nehrus honour its honour the draft reply drafted by gandhi contained the ill concealed threat to the maharaja of jammu and kashmir that nehru would return to retrieve his honour a threat which however does not find mention in the official congress resolution i and all are of opinion that your presence here is essential above everything else remember that you are under an organization which you have adorned so long its needs must be paramount for you and me remember also that your honour is ours and your obedience to the congress call automatically transfers to it the duty of guarding your honour the committee is also solicitous equally with you about sheikh abdullahs case and the welfare of the kashmir people therefore i expect you to return in answer to this you will tell maharaja saheb that as soon as you are freed by the congress you will return to kashmir to retrieve your honour and fulfill your mission draft reply to jawaharlal nehru june 21 1946 mahatma gandhi the last phase vol ii p 346 cwmg vol 91 pp 180 81 gandhis moha for nehru did not permit him to ask abdullah or nehru more about the quit kashmir slogan who was being asked to quit kashmir tragically for the hindu nation the inc unquestioningly accepted gandhis diktat that the affairs of jammu and kashmir were nehrus personal cause and the events after august 1947 proved how misplaced was gandhis confidence in abdullah and nehru gandhi died soon thereafter but nehru had to swallow the poison he had stirred and brought to the surface in jammu and kashmir when he was forced to arrest abdullah and incarcerate him in kodaikanal on charges of sedition nehru and the country were forced to face the truth that there was a lot more to the national conferences quit kashmir campaign than mere sloganeering and more than had been evident in 1946 gandhis insistence that the territory of this bhumi belonged in equal measure in diminishing order of equality to muslims christians parsis jews and hindus in that order was taken seriously by post independence nehruvian secular india secular india stood by and watched sheikh abdullahs son farooq abdullah implement his fathers quit kashmir slogan faithfully in letter and spirit from 1989 onwards his son omar abdullah signaled in parliament his intention to keep it that way

4335318 the amarnath shrine board must be allotted land to erect temporary structures for pilgrims this is our country and the land belongs to us why should we be scared to acquire it from the jammu and kashmir government
4335319 it is a shame that the government cannot allot its own land to the temple and its own people
4335320 along with the land for the amarnath shrine board land should also be earmarked for the displaced hindu kashmiri pandits in the valley so that they can have a homeland their security can be handed over to the indian army
4335321 wed like to thank you in 140 characters or less and we just did

4335324 i expect us to be competitive and win on saturday and i expect us to go to aami and win next week that makes it four potential wins then we got richmond at the end and ill still be trying to win the game
4335325 most of the games this year we really evaluate those games but this ones got a lot of importance in it for the fact is i wanna win the game ive said before weve got three games to go and i do not want to finish last
4335326 i want to win thats the culture you want to develop
4335327 yeah were getting closer to it a decision theres no doubt about that and i mean adem yze and whitey jeff white have trained well
4335328 while theyre still seriously in the mix of being picked depending on how they go and how they pull up and where jeffs situation is well probably have a chat with them at some stage next week theyve been very professional

4335334 the announcement delivers a tremendously strong message of player commitment to the club and our aspirations for premiership success
4335335 we have a strong culture amongst the playing group and the club is moving in the right direction and it is so pleasing to have todays group commit themselves to the vision and future of the hawthorn football club
4335336 the best thing about the negotiations is they havent been about a dollar value the strongest message to come out is this commitment from a large group of players towards hawthorns quest for success
4335337 part of that stems back to luke hodge sam mitchell and lance franklin who over the last 12 18 months could have auctioned themselves to another club for more money and decided what was happening at hawthorn was a chance they couldnt turn down
4335338 the effect is we have now got some pretty strong players who believe in the same philosophy

4335574 there could have been some people still inside so we got there quickly and tried to act as fast as possible
4335575 they said the truck was in about 10 feet of water and maybe 2 feet sticking out
4335576 it was quite a complex incident and certainly had a lot of demands
4335577 theres only one other time that a tractor trailer busted through the guardrail about 15 years ago but just the cab was hanging over the edge
4335578 other than that i dont think a vehicle has ever actually made it into the water
4335579 the unique nature of this incident and its aftermath have posed challenges for us all
4335580 but i want to commend the response of our state and local agencies and first responders for their quick and decisive action when they arrived on the scene
4335581 we had no problems talking to firefighters on the bridge the divers in the water or the officers in the air
4335582 from our perspective all the partners worked well and there was no communication breakdown
4335583 overall it was a pretty coordinated activity for such a complex operation
4335584 this incident has always been considered one of the bridges worst case scenarios
4335585 without a doubt they have been extremely helpful in summoning people to emergencies where there are no other phones available the problem is when we receive a cellphone call and the person doesnt know where they are

4335599 what would the offspring look like if john waters boned count chocula
4335600 its a big state issue thats why you have states that have taken it on themselves to set the minimum wage the worker benefits from that
4335601 there would be unscrupulous business people who pay as little as possible and the worker in that situation would never have a chance to get out of poverty a floor is a good thing
4335602 l ooking at the minimum wage from the point of view of a full time worker i cant see how anyone could live on the federal minimum wage
4335603 i doubt theres any part of the country where even a single person could have more than an impoverished life style making only minimum wage for 40 hours a week

4335613 de las 22 gobernaciones que gan ch vez en las pasadas elecciones ya han abandonado tres gobernadores chavistas pertenecientes a las importantes regiones de carabobo guarico y yacui adem s el partido podemos abandon la alianza tras la derrota de diciembre por lo que perdi otros dos gobernadores en sucre y aragua a d a de hoy y con los datos que manejamos la alianza chavista podr a perder otras ocho o diez gobernaciones lo que reducir a notablemente el poder del presidente
4335614 tanto del lado del chavismo como de la oposici n pueden alcanzarse nuevas candidaturas nicas pues aunque se ha cerrado el plazo para su presentaci n la legislaci n venezolana permite retirar una candidatura hasta una semana antes de las elecciones por lo tanto un partido puede retirar a su aspirante y apoyar al de sus aliados

4335622 reports published in government run news outlets point to an effort on the part of the authorities to use the mass media to spread accusations that the seven prisoners have engaged in subversive activities and to continue to deprive these bahais from any access to legal counsel by maligning mrs shirin ebadi the well known iranian human rights lawyer and nobel peace prize winner who together with her colleagues has stated her readiness to defend the bahais
4335623 the iranian government seizes every means at its disposal to stigmatize the bahais and then within the poisoned atmosphere it has itself created when it wants to discredit someone it asserts that the person is a bahai
4335624 mrs ebadi is not the first individual upon whom this tactic has been used as a lawyer mrs ebadi defends individuals and groups of many different backgrounds this does not mean that she necessarily espouses their beliefs what then is the state sanctioned press trying to insinuate when it contends that her daughter is a bahai

4335641 this yatra is of both for hindus and muslims you see every year the percentage of yatris is increasing it is because people from both communities are helping in making it better
4335642 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4335643 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4335644 going to a blended mode you can still get that same performance almost the same or nearly identical environmental benefits but much decreased cost
4335645 we had the knowledge base from the ev1 we knew how to do electrically propelled vehicles
4335646 the ability to put this engine which is an off the shelf unit for all intents and purposes into the car to extend its range two three 400 miles its important
4335647 its probably the easiest way to integrate electric propulsion into peoples daily lives

4335653 the fig and the ioc are the proper bodies to handle this
4335654 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4335655 degrade and burn up on re entry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4335656 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4335657 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4335658 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4335659 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4335660 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4335661 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed

4335697 i used to like aj but now hes a cia jesuit shill
4335698 i supported and gave money to rp but he dropped the ball in my opinion so now hes a liar and a con man
4335699 wow either alex can do no wrong or hes totally lost the plot which is it ive read a few people on this thread referring to alex as being a narcissist consider this definition of narcissism
4335700 does that define alex jones you decide personally i dont think hes any more rude to callers these days than he ever was shit has alex ever suffered fools gladly however i do reckon that lately he can get quite overdefensive when it comes to his detractors after all this time you think hed be used to that by now
4335701 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4335702 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4335703 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4335704 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4335705 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4335706 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4335707 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions
4335708 we did find a number of human hits many of them concentrated around boat docks
4335709 that really points to the suggestion that at least some people are dumping waste
4335710 i tell you when youre dead to the word of god youre dead to the god of the word
4335711 its not what you take out of a man that leads him to jesus its what you put into him youre never more free than when youre living with jesus christ
4335712 he seemed like a guy i could just hang out with not this famous preacher
4335713 its always refreshing when you hear someone whos not afraid to tell the truth
4335714 its the kind of preaching thats been around for a while but you dont hear much anymore
4335715 its not necessarily feel good preaching its straight from the bible
4335716 hes really down to earth and he not only preaches he teaches
4335717 psalm 119 is the longest psalm this section is in eight verse couplets and the emphasis is the importance of gods word he uses eight words to refer to the word of god here and eight refers to new beginnings in numerology
4335718 someone would find a combination of skills and become way more uber than the rest and then wed all have to play that exact character build or perish
4335719 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4335720 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4335721 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4335722 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4335723 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4335724 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4335725 the next generation srx is the result of the continued exploration and refining of cadillac design language with the goal of creating dramatic presence in the luxury crossover space
4335726 the next generation srx along with the new cts sport wagon showcases cadillac taking its dramatic design into new directions particularly cars and crossovers that are the right size at the right time for todays luxury consumers
4335727 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4335728 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4335729 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4335730 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4335731 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4335732 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4335733 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4335734 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage
4335735 11 year old vsider who could also be a pedophile
4335736 it wasnt excruciating pain but theres some discomfort i came out of the box hard my first four steps and felt something in my left quad i didnt think it was that serious i went home iced and stretched as much as i could and hoped it would be better it was a little worse i got some treatment and i came to the honest realization that i was at best 60 or 70 percent so i went and told charlie
4335737 its got to be a benefit for the umpires because a lot of those things i know we watch it on replay and say how the heck do you miss it
4335738 but they get one shot at it and you look at and see all those fans and then you try to find that white ball sometimes it goes by quickly so i dont think thats going to hurt them
4335739 i think if you start doing that then where do you draw the line different ballparks have different ground rules but the ground rules are all the same on interference and the fair ball and the fair and foul pole
4335740 but it might be a couple days before i feel 100 percent its still pretty sore
4335741 it was a good way to get him back into the flow of things
4335742 get him an at bat and also to rest j d
4335743 i think hes fine to play tonight he got in the game the other night and he actually ran real well but it was a chore to get him to that point so we gave him last night well give him tonight
4335744 the biggest hurdle he was looking at was sliding he kind of worked himself into a position knowing he can get down
4335745 that area you just dont want to slide too hard on it
4335746 you dont want to reaggrivate it right away but these last couple days ive been fortunate to not hurt it while i was in there
4335747 but the biggest thing is were winning so it makes it a little easier
4335748 rollins said digesting his first dodger dog of the series
4335749 whatever theres nothing to make out of the reaction i dont get it
4335750 there are times like its one of those cities i might catch some flack for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4335751 i went down and eric bruntlett came in and played
4335752 he got booed his first time out there when the team returned to philadelphia because he made two errors in new york
4335753 there are some days when you sit back and say boy these fans are behind us and you feel it and it can get you going or dang they just booed him and im coming up next i guess i better get a hit then you dont and it bounces down through the team person to person to person
4335754 youre booing him because you want costey to play this man has a job to do and he might go out there and do well because you give him the energy
4335755 but hes coming up in the third inning and youre booing before he gets to the plate thats tough to go up there its hard enough to hit and now youre like man these people dont even want me out here thats the aspect i was talking about
4335756 man they were all over him when he comes out of the bullpen
4335757 im running up to him because im trying to reinforce that we need him i understand whats going on out there but we need him its hard to put it of your mind because youre human and you hear it then you throw a ball and it gets louder
4335758 i dont pay as much attention on the road because theyre not my fans
4335759 if they want to boo us as the visiting team keep giving me the boos but at home give us some home field advantage
4335760 thats like me saying the oakland as havent won since 90 something
4335761 and i was an as fan growing up i still look at them if were not in it thats still my hometown team i never want them to win as long as im playing dont get me wrong but take what you have take the team that you have and push them to do better
4335762 dont take black friday game 3 of the 1977 national league championship series between the phillies and dodgers and put that on these guys some of them dont even know i didnt even know until about 15 minutes ago maybe 20 minutes ago im like black friday is that like palm sunday you know about the history of the team dont get me wrong but your job when youre there youre trying to change that for that time period my tenure here were we successful thats all can control

4335764 i dont like setting targets i think really the major target is going to be staying in the premier league
4335765 obviously wed like to improve considerably from what we did last year but i dont want to quantify that by saying this place or that place
4335766 ill see how the season pans out and see how good we can be and then maybe start setting definite targets during the course of the season
4335767 weve signed players and we are happy with the signings we think that it has made us stronger as a unit
4335768 its a new team it might take a bit of time for certain positions to bed in but i have been very happy with the way people have been working in the pre season i have been very happy with the pre season results
4335769 he had a thigh strain when he arrived from everton and we dont want to take the risk by playing him too early im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal on 23 august but well have to do without him at hull
4335770 i think with the quality we have got we are capable of pushing for mid table i think it would be realistically a good achievement for us

4335800 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4335801 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable

4335824 the performers for chinese character parts went into the models underground at 2 pm and after getting in there they could not come out
4335825 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance
4335826 so altogether they had to stay there for six to seven hours and they could not even go to the toilet so they all wore nappies
4335827 with all the spectators coming into the stadium the performers have to prepare in advance
4335828 every performer should stay in a fixed place at a fixed time
4335829 with so many netbooks now available which is the best one out there im mostly concerned with getting the best bang for my buck so im not too interested in any of those higher end units
4335830 im very very disappointed that we did not get it
4335831 we do understand we have a niche there being a sales tax market

4335834 according to the national institute on drug abuse 20 of the population ages 12 and up have used a prescription for non medical reasons
4335835 feeling the stress to get that scholarship or to make it big
4335836 theres always the pressure to finish the game and not come out
4335837 it goes back to your environment and who is controlling it

4335842 die einzige wirklichkeit f r die ich mich interessiere ist die des menschlichen verhaltens
4335843 its not only that major hooda is a gallantry award winner
4335844 there are a number of officers in the indian army who are doing a gallant job every day you must remember that each and every soldier of the indian armed forces is doing a gallant job every day
4335845 the sense of belonging that it gives me makes me feel proud of this great institution called the indian armed forces
4335846 still to this day i think people are in shock over it and a lot of people are still in denial
4335847 its just the hardest thing weve ever done a nightmare come to life
4335848 had a deep personal trust for each other and talked about personal issues
4335849 its just hard to think of chris benoit in that way
4335850 we all loved him so much and we all respected him so much
4335851 a lot of us are kind of in denial because we dont associate the chris benoit we knew and loved with the chris benoit who did that horrible thing
4335852 but i just thought the original bill was too broad and allowed too much i still do
4335853 i send greetings to those celebrating the 61st anniversary of indias independence
4335854 indias path to independence is a great story of liberty overcoming oppression led by mahatma gandhi the indian people engaged in non violent protests and campaigns in the pursuit of freedom
4335855 on august 15 1947 they achieved their goal gained their independence and became a democratic nation
4335856 it is also a time to remember the rich contributions that the indian americans have made to our country and reminds us of the close ties that our nation shares with india
4335857 first lady laura and i send our best wishes on the occasion
4335858 one of its most important relationships in an uncertain world
4335859 with indian american communities across our country in celebrating the 61st anniversary of indias independence
4335860 it is only natural that the worlds oldest and the worlds largest constitutional democracies should enjoy strong relations
4335861 america has one of its most important relationships in an uncertain world
4335862 the growing partnership between india and united states and that is why i voted for the us india nuclear accord
4335863 insulate the poorer sections of society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices
4335864 all over the world there is growing realisation of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change
4335865 it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy
4335866 after almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004 investment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this area
4335867 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4335868 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4335869 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4335870 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4335871 we have been fighting for our position for over five months
4335872 substantial losses have accrued during this time we can no longer continue our discussions with ford and are in the position of having no choice except to accept their market consolidation plan
4335873 and the idea being if the dealerships are more profitable they usually create happier customers that are more satisfied because they can take care of their customers better and they have better financial health
4335874 we have great regrets that this course of action has become necessary
4335875 the people that have worked with us here are the best
4335876 so were very much geared up and well very much open our arms and invite them to come to 4101 clinton highway
4335877 it was just 20 years ago i could tell you every car that was on the road
4335878 theres just a lot more competition theres a lot more cars that customers have the choices of purchasing
4335879 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4335880 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4335881 this is a very significant event not only in polish american relations but also in advancing the security of nato members in europe
4335882 the intent is not a message to russia whether russians see it this way is something the russians will have to arrive at
4335883 its designed to deal with future attacks from terrorist groups which might arise
4335884 theres no question whats going on the areas being occupied by russian troops russias shown no desire to leave anytime soon
4335885 putins determined to put russia back on the world scene but also wants to be accepted as a full and democratic nation that means it also has to abide by the rules the situation going on today is a very risky game
4335886 this drives up the size of the plant as well as the construction costs and operational costs
4335887 we work closely with the utilities to keep the rates competitive
4335888 we met with lcub and watts bar before we made the decision to move to the park
4335889 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home

4335897 this guy is going to try and jack my camera and he has a lake behind him retard
4335898 no the camera is taking the pictures me i just point the damn thing i mean i can take pictures but for a human to physiologically take a picture involves looking at the thing remembering every detail about it and producing it as a drawing or painting or something else i cant do because i have the organic equivalent to a bad memory chip so please go fuck yourself now and leave me alone asshole
4335899 why the fuck do people do this shit to me when im taking pictures
4335900 i have heard you and understand we must secure the borders first
4335901 mom if god loves us than why does he let people starve why does he sit by and do nothing while we kill the planet and each other if he is our father than wouldnt he want to help his children

4335907 god please let those who are wallowing in thier self pity to put thier feet on the right path
4335908 dear god thank you for the food i had on this day and please bless a child in africa with a decent meal even if that means i am unable to eat for a day
4335909 mom when adam and eve didnt listen why didnt he just start over
4335910 because he wanted to show humans and the angels that the humans couldnt rule themselves so he is giving them every chance they need to realize that we cant do this with out him
4335911 undoubtedly the pressures and the burden of the outpouring which approaches 144 days on august 23rd have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in their relationship
4335912 let no one cheat you of your reward taking delight in false humility and worship of angels intruding into those things which he has not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
4335913 17 from now on let no one trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus

4335968 the u s says these elections are essential to get iraqis who have taken risks and stopped fighting into the political system
4335969 well what happens if the political system is rigged against those people i think some of those people might return to violence
4335970 the governing parties have lost their popular base and they dont want these elections because theyre going to lose
4335971 if there is any fraud in the next elections iraq will be a mess again
4335972 this time we will use force to take control of things

4335976 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4335977 two of the three opposition parties dont support the government and say we should be defeated mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say you know whether he will defeat us or not

4335983 the aussie is really struggling to breathe at the moment it appears mr botros said
4335984 the us dollar has been rallying one more day of this and weve confirmed a fortnights worth of us dollar strength across the board mr botros said
4335985 there does seem to be an unwinding of carry trades mr botros said
4335986 the market is heavily centred on selling on rallies mr botros said
4335987 when this thing comes out its going to be shocking ive never seen anything like this before
4335988 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4335989 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4335990 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect even if the carcass had have been eviscerated by a predator or a scavenger the entrails wouldnt just be sitting up on top like that
4335991 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones

4335996 i need some milk let me go find a black owned grocery store right quick
4335997 hi just saw the two chairs any chance we could look at them today
4335998 which is great but would have been even better if a phone number had been included
4335999 im not worried about state owned companies like some people are
4336000 many of the major corporations in south korea that already have investments in australia are state owned
4336001 over many years weve had many countries invest in australia that are essentially state owned
4336002 but also theres a number of other factors relating to the mining the strength of the company which is the worlds largest and clearly a very solid foundation
4336003 we have the federal government in south australia saying oh we made short term decisions without long term knowledge in terms of water resources and now were going to have to rectify that
4336004 homeless and childless hes proud and patriotic hes sad scared mad and bitter staff sgt wilbur lee quinn 58 of montrose is looking death in the face and hes not ready to go coming our way soon
4336005 the loss of the other malaysian players made me a little upset but i need to concentrate on the mens singles and try to get to the final
4336006 he was in good shape and played very well i was too slow to catch up in the beginning of the second game
4336007 i thought if i flopped something here my ace might be the best hand and i could make a big pot said filippi a tournament regular who also has played on
4336008 i smooth called figuring hed shut down after that filippi said
4336009 maybe he thinks i have a draw maybe he thinks i have 3 5 and im looking for a deuce or maybe he thinks i have two big overcards
4336010 im thinking he could have a full house so i was going
4336011 or maybe he was on a stone cold bluff figuring i didnt have a 6 or maybe i have two overcards filippi could raise to find out if james had hit his hand but he chose to simply call
4336012 i was pretty sure i had the best hand but i wasnt going to make it into a big pot and risk getting check raised he said
4336013 i was just going to let him fire into the pot
4336014 i still thought i had the best hand filippi said
4336015 when he checked the river i checked behind him because i didnt want to get check raised
4336016 i was feeling really under the weather for the semifinals and i just kind of went back to the village took a nap drank some sprite and settled down
4336017 thank you so much for showing me how to get my government grant your info is the best i have seen on the internet i got my small business grant and i never have to pay it back thank you again so much

4336021 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4336022 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4336023 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4336024 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4336025 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4336026 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4336027 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4336028 we notified our commodity fund investors last week that the steep decline in natural gas and oil prices has had an adverse impact on our performance

4336030 demi allah orang seperti anda tidak layak untuk ditolak hanya saja engkau adalah orang kafir sedangkan aku adalah seorang muslimah sehingga tidak halal untuk menikah denganmu jika kamu mau masuk islam maka itulah mahar bagiku dan aku tidak meminta selain dari itu

4336032 di antara kebaikan wanita ialah memudahkan maharnya dan memudahkan rahimnya
4336033 pernikahan yang paling besar keberkahannya ialah yang paling mudah maharnya
4336034 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
4336035 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
4336036 when modeling species distributions it is important to consider a large amount of climatic data and evaluate the methods used especially when dealing with important issues such as invasive species whose ecological limitations may not be immediately obvious
4336037 snakes already get an unwarranted bad reputation and the last thing needed in our current biodiversity crisis is to drum up more hatred of these animals by suggesting an impending full scale north american invasion by pythons when properly constructed climate models suggest the opposite
4336038 that bill subversive sharp watch out for him misses nothing a dots connector
4336039 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
4336040 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context
4336041 these results are the first to demonstrate that we can unambiguously detect that influence in ice core records
4336042 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4336043 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4336044 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4336045 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4336046 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4336047 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4336048 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4336049 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4336050 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4336051 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4336052 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin
4336053 sticks and stones will break my bones but words will gt
4336054 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4336055 if i breathe or turn the wrong way it bothers me im off for therapy right now
4336056 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4336057 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4336058 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4336059 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4336060 you got a dream you gotta protect it people cant do somethin themselves they wanna tell you you cant do it if you want somethin go get it period
4336061 yes im overcompensating for my insecurities and lack of masculinity but ive got a really big dog
4336062 esta menor utilidad se explica fundamentalmente por la disminuci n en el resultado no operacional y a una p rdida contable extraordinaria neta de impuestos vinculada a la reciente venta de participaci n accionaria en las sociedades dominicanas empresa generadora de electricidad itabo y new caribbean investment
4336063 este mejor resultado operacional fue reflejo de un alza de 9 2 por ciento en el margen de explotaci n derivado principalmente de mayores ingresos por venta de energ a en el sistema interconectado central sic durante el primer semestre de 2008
4336064 i was reading something the other day about alan kulwicki when he won his championship in 1992
4336065 he wrecked out at dover with six races to go and he was about 280 points behind and came back to win the championship so being only 128 behind clint is not the end of the world
4336066 we need to race to win and if we can win some races we can close that gap really quickly
4336067 ive dragged my family halfway around the world and today it just feels like it was all worthwhile
4336068 i just want to qualify for every race that i do i think if i do that im doing a pretty good job
4336069 i want to finish every race not get involved in any wrecks and do as good as i can i think top 30s top 25s or even a top 20 finish will be outstanding
4336070 as far as im concerned we aint even i still owe him one
4336071 just who are you in that photo of the 1966 pit stop
4336072 what were you doing with the blackboard on a pit stop
4336073 you get on the outside of the pit box and you hold the blackboard up with his number on it so he can see it then after youve got his attention you lower it down and hold it where you want him to stop the car
4336074 algunos creen que ese petr leo es de petrobras pero ese petr leo es de la uni n el estado federal brasile o y petrobras es de la uni n

4336078 i dont regret what weve done ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it
4336079 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives

4336084 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
4336085 whats left for us to decide as the people is there anything left for us to decide as these corporations have hijacked our government and control about every department and agency
4336086 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4336087 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4336088 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4336089 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition
4336090 she was my agent there for about six years she got rid of me
4336091 its the competition the self esteem how you feel about yourself as a player you want to compete and get better you dont want to regress i dont want to play out there if im going to finish 180th on the money list
4336092 i love competition i love having a chance to win golf tournaments you cant buy that you can buy a lot of things with money but you cant buy playing great golf thats all i want thats all any player really wants at this stage of the game there might be some players who need the money but i dont need the money i want to win again i want to get that feeling again
4336093 its very frustrating more frustrating on my family and wife now my kids are all over me youre old enough now did you miss the cut again stuff like that its like hey look at the tape i did well in this tournament 15 years ago they dont care about that they want it now
4336094 my son followed me somewhere and i didnt have a good day he was really bummed out its tougher on them than me i want to play well for them so they can get excited about it
4336095 youre thinking about all the things youre trying to do theres so much information now for a guy like me im artsy im an artist i picture stuff i cant be a mechanic and ive become too mechanical
4336096 i dont need another four i think my wife will kill me at home

4336100 he wants to be great hes always asking questions always studying film
4336101 its always great to start a season like that to connect with the team to connect with carson
4336102 i dont think the green bay fans were too happy they thought i was heckling them but i was pointing to my family
4336103 if youve got two tight ends that can stretch the field or block it really puts the defense in a situation where they never know if youre going to run or pass
4336104 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4336105 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4336106 actually my fiancee saw it and she was in the car with me and she almost choked
4336107 that being said i love the area of greensboro the grasses are the same and the greens are running at about the same speed
4336108 thats what i expect next time ill talk to mark brazil the tournament director maybe next year if i happen to sneak out a win this year i want to be on the side of a building downtown thats definitely an upgrade
4336109 im in a position right now where ive got nothing to lose
4336110 i would say theres more pressure in me trying to keep my job right now
4336111 if i had to guess i would guess that i needed a top five in order to get to next week and i may need more than that
4336112 i need to play solid and finish as high as i can and win it if i can
4336113 i just have to keep building so that maybe i can finish strong enough so im not in q school
4336114 there are a lot of birdies out there and thats kind of nice because its a long season and a lot of the courses we play are a grind
4336115 this is the kind of a course that if you are playing well your score shows it
4336116 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4336117 it can happen once early in a game and not happen any more so when it comes when you have to take it
4336118 im seeing about the same stuff out of brandon that im seeing out of josh
4336119 were not getting as much out of our running backs because were not getting much out of that front right now
4336120 im standing behind those guys and a couple of times i thought there were some good seams to run the football in but a couple of times we ran the ball we might as well had cones up front as offensive linemen
4336121 the problem with the offensive line right now is if you have one guy who isnt pulling his weight it ruins an entire football play
4336122 were somewhat in that direction with the first unit but with the second unit were not even in the ballpark
4336123 the running game as far as the running back the quarterback and the line everything is still building
4336124 weve got two running backs that we know can play
4336125 i do think that our running backs need to be a little bit more aggressive
4336126 there were a couple of times today where i thought they were kind of floating around and not really looking for a way to get north with the football and part of that may have been that they didnt see a lot of push out of the line
4336127 i think chance raines has got to help us a little
4336128 weve got a little flexibility in that we recruited russ nenon as a center
4336129 but hopefully well get the same thing out of trey bailey that we got out of steve justice and we wont have to take him off the field if he becomes as durable as steve was well be fine
4336130 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
4336131 we have come to the end of temporary sheltering of these displaced people we cannot keep them for any longer period
4336132 the 2 000 immigrants in the six camps are all making arrangements to leave but we have a contingency plan to assist those who may be stranded on friday those who have no place to go
4336133 authorities have not communicated any plans for the reintegration of the displaced nor has it properly engaged in a dialogue with the camp residents about options for their immediate future
4336134 the information given to us by the authorities indicates that tomorrow friday will be the final day at the camps
4336135 we do not know what is going to happen tomorrow we are just waiting to see
4336136 at the beginning of the crisis in may the number of those displaced in gauteng province was 19 000 now we are down to only 2 000 in the camps
4336137 the bulk of them have since returned to the communities they left and they are safe living there
4336138 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4336139 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4336140 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed that was that
4336141 not much i could do about it so it was definitely a surprise result for me
4336142 his supreme achievement also drew comparison with tiger woods the worlds no 1 golfer and roger federer then the worlds dominant tennis player while back home his name was raised in the same sentences as hideki matsui of the new york yankees baseball team who earns 19 million a year and dirk nowitzki of the dallas mavericks basketball team 18 million a year
4336143 i dont think we shall need a call bell as hello can be heard 10 to 20 feet away what do you think
4336144 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4336145 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4336146 night cream designed to reduce crows feet worth the cost
4336147 somehow this was an oversight for whatever reason and i should say ive seen it happen before
4336148 no one lost employment which was one of the major considerations
4336149 its a situation where id rather solve the problem now rather than wait
4336150 technology is so important now i think this is directly hurting the classroom
4336151 i think we could take a look at the technology department and determine if its on the right path
4336152 when it started we said to ourselves that we would be happy if 10 000 people took part
4336153 so to see more than 10 times as many signing up was fantastic
4336154 ps pdf of naish 2005 available to anyone who asks
4336155 given recent evidence indicating that the phorusrhachid titanis also colonised north america prior to the formation of the land bridge
4336156 well youre already the one on leave why dont you just stay that way
4336157 you people are all going to rush to disagree now arent you
4336158 a group of people with a common interest or belief
4336159 that was interesting im kind of speechless so bear with me
4336160 that was exciting i dont know what to say i felt really comfortable tonight and that was the most important thing i think i worked out the jitters from the first game
4336161 early in the game we left some guys out there
4336162 youre hoping it didnt come back to haunt us dickerson had a couple of big hits for us
4336163 i just told myself once he got on third just relax and take a couple of extra deep breaths and try not to put too much pressure on myself and try to succeed focus on what i need to do in that situation
4336164 we just have to get him out of that first inning without getting into trouble
4336165 if he can have a 1 2 3 first inning who knows how deep he can go in the ballgame im glad he got the win because hes been pitching great
4336166 we had a little verbal confirmation i just talked to him about it and he didnt know if i understood what he said but i got the sign from the get go i was geared up kepp is a great bunter as soon as he made the call i knew it was an automatic run
4336167 he wants to be great hes always asking questions always studying film he tried to learn the entire offence in the first day and then was frustrated when he didnt have it down
4336168 when you get a new guy that comes in thats so hungry to learn so hungry to be ready to play and contribute its great
4336169 its always great to start a season like that to connect with the team to connect with carson
4336170 i dont think the green bay fans were too happy they thought i was heckling them but i was pointing to my family
4336171 if youve got two tight ends that can stretch the field or block it really puts the defence in a situation where they never know if youre going to run or pass
4336172 how spoiled ive been coming from one great to the next
4336173 im seeing how many more similarities there are between the two the more i play with carson theyre great competitors they have great attitudes theyre great students of the game they really can put it where they want it so its been a really easy transition for me
4336174 he practised a lot better wednesday a lot better than he practised last week
4336175 if the small and big boys of brooklyn find it a pleasure to shout at me i have no objections
4336176 no matter where we play i go through the same ordeal and at the present time i am so used to it that at times i forget to smile at my tormentors

4336206 2001 ruined my life a friend died and i got charged with his murder i choose not to remember it
4336207 i am somewhat puzzled by the fact he pleaded guilty then reversed it
4336208 their message this morning has come out loud and clear they want to talk and ive said a number of times the door is open the phone is on lets have a discussion greenberg said on radio today
4336209 for me its been encouraging that theyve understood the order of the court and they will abide by it until such time as we have a discussion which is important
4336210 there could be a range of things and that will probably unfold over the next week or so when we open some dialogue with them
4336211 im not sure where this will head but certainly its a different step for nrl clubs probably a different step for australian sport
4336212 i suppose its the first development that shows both sonny bill and toulon have recognised that any order of the supreme court is not something that you can take lightly
4336213 it is a serious piece of legistlation and he should act accordingly which he has done and thats a pleasing sign its also important in that it shows cant ignore it the injunction irrelevant of where you are in the world
4336214 it does have significant ramifications so people who say that contracts arent worth the piece of paper theyre written on i think this sends a very clear message that if youve got a contract and breach it and the supreme court then has a look at that then youve got some ramifications

4336366 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle

4336371 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4336372 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4336373 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4336374 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4336375 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4336376 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4336377 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do

4336381 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway

4336383 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4336384 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4336385 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4336386 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4336387 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4336388 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4336389 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4336390 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4336391 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4336400 say to the israelites on the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of rest a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts
4336401 the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement hold a sacred assembly and deny yourselves and present an offering made to the lord by fire 28 do no work on that day because it is the day of atonement when atonement is made for you before the lord your god 29 anyone who does not deny himself on that day must be cut off from his people 30 i will destroy from among his people anyone who does any work on that day 31 you shall do no work at all this is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come wherever you live 32 it is a sabbath of rest for you and you must deny yourselves from the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to observe your sabbath
4336402 say to the israelites on the fifteenth day of the seventh month the lords feast of tabernacles begins and it lasts for seven days
4336403 these are the lords appointed feasts which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for bringing offerings made to the lord by fire the burnt offerings and grain offerings sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day
4336404 so beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month after you have gathered the crops of the land celebrate the festival to the lord for seven days the first day is a day of rest and the eighth day also is a day of rest

4336444 ive never heard of it ive never seen it before
4336445 its an amazing inspiration every day to come to practice and see someone who still wants to be a part of a team
4336446 and to come back and work as hard as he does and help our team hes an amazing young man just amazing he inspires all of us every day coaches and players alike he makes everybody feel good every day
4336447 you go out there and you dont feel good about something youre having a bad day then you look over at javy and think what hes been through and you see him out there working as hard as he does hes phenomenal
4336448 ill use javier as an example for however many years i remain in coaching believe me hes as tough as they come hes walking tall
4336449 its your senior year its what you look forward to its what you work for your whole college career
4336450 i knew i was coming back the whole time it just makes it a little tougher because its your third one and maybe there is a little psychological game there
4336451 but its just like the other two you just have to get out there and get rid of the rust its been eight months since ive touched the field thats the major part of the whole surgery first to rehab second to get the rust out im real close i think im pretty close to being game ready
4336452 the coaching staff has been real careful about that bringing him along at his own pace
4336453 i ice it four or five times a day and take a lot of ibuprofen
4336454 i dont do a lot of reps during practice just because of that the reps i get are key reps that i have to have
4336455 i love the game of football and thats what im playing right now
4336456 long term concerns are to be worried about in the future youve got to live day by day
4336457 i havent heard anything about possibly needing knee replacement later in life im prepared for the worst when that day comes it will come
4336458 im going to use the braces during the games which i havent done in previous years im not going to worry about possibly getting hurt again
4336459 ive been telling them the hard part is being in rehab and doing it right because thats the key to getting back stronger and better than it was
4336460 he inspires everybody just by being on the practice field
4336461 but its more than that to him he doesnt want to just be here standing around and cheerleading he wants to help our team he wants to play

4336470 el tema de fondo ni en los contenidos de los ocho proyectos como tampoco un juicio de valor porque quien puede negar la importancia de lo que es el pre mbulo
4336471 lo que no est prohibido est permitido el obst culo es que la 9768 en su art culo 4 define que la convenci n no podr apartarse de la competencia de la presente ley
4336472 no hubo una omisi n sino una voluntad del legislador entrerriano que al momento de acordar los temas no incluy el pre mbulo y ese silencio no puede interpretarse como una autorizaci n
4336473 el dictado de un pre mbulo no constituye un acto de gobierno sino el ejercicio de las funciones que le son propias para insertar un plexo que forma parte de la letra constitucional
4336474 de ninguna manera la 9768 coarta la posibilidad al constituyente de prologar la constituci n de la provincia un pre mbulo es el corolario y lo que explica el esp ritu de quienes hacemos esta tarea que nos compromete con el futuro
4336475 no voy a dejar una brecha abierta para que se entienda que discutimos la forma cuando en realidad lo que subyace es el fondo
4336476 trabajar sobre aspectos legales y no sobre actos reclamativos o de deseos
4336477 esta discusi n establece un marco de posibilidades y cierra o abre los debates de acuerdo a que esas posibilidades est n o no autorizadas
4336478 entendemos y as lo se alamos antes de la selecciones que el tema no se encuentra habilitado por la ley de convocatoria y resulta de toda claridad que se encuentra expresamente prohibido
4336479 no dice ni s ni no no creo que el contenido de una s ntesis como ella llam al pre mbulo sea tan da ina para que se nos declare inconstitucional si es un pr logo introductorio donde plasmar amos una s ntesis de normas esenciales
4336480 siendo el pre mbulo un texto integrativo del texto constitucional no podr tocarse si no est habilitado por la ley de la convocatoria
4336481 el primer argumento es literal y el otro si se quiere es m s interpretativo el literal no est prohibido y el pre mbulo no figura porque no puede reformarse lo que no existe
4336482 nunca vamos a poder poner un pre mbulo a n cuando se lo habilite porque nos van a decir que no se puede comprender el esp ritu del 33 y a adi
4336483 qui n si no somos nosotros ser capaz de hacer un pre mbulo
4336484 el pueblo nos dio mandato para la reforma dentro de determinados l mites no discutimos acerca del pre mbulo como una cuesti n ideol gica sino si es un tema habilitado o no
4336485 preceptivo y sino lo es no tuvo por qu estar en la ley de convocatoria
4336486 fija los l mites del poder constituyente pero el pre mbulo no es constituci n no forma parte de ella y no est incorporado al articulado
4336487 la ley de reforma se hubiera metido en los poderes propios de los constituyentes
4336488 el pre mbulo es una resoluci n de la convenci n no un art culo y as como establece su presupuesto y mecanismos puede por la misma v a t cnica establecer un pre mbulo el pre mbulo a nadie obliga el pre mbulo no es una norma
4336489 un pre mbulo tiene sentido si hacemos uno de nuestros tiempos que rompa los moldes que defina nuestra historia y con ideolog a peronista y que hable de un dios reparador es nsito al poder de la convenci n establecer un pre mbulo que prologue o sea colof n de la constituci n
4336490 no es un poema pico todos los pre mbulos determinan los principios fundamentales que luego desarrolla el contenido normativo de la constituci n
4336491 tenemos que interpretar la norma sin que nos tiemble la decisi n de hacerlo
4336492 me hubiera gustado sincer brasesco discutir un pre mbulo me hubiera gustado que mi constituci n tenga un pre mbulo pero estoy acostumbrado a que la rigidez de la ley es superior a mis gustos y pretensiones
4336493 no es f cil resolver estas cuestione sin caer en sofismas interminables
4336494 no hay unanimidad en el acierto o en el error
4336495 la suerte no est echada y quiero exhortar a todos para que viabilicemos un pre mbulo y lo hago porque conozco la apertura de coraz n de nuestros colegas si se hubiera aprobado la enmienda tendr amos quiz s la posibilidad
4336496 no permitamos que un rbol nos impida ver el bosque
4336497 que nos ataquen por el pre mbulo por inconstitucional nos hemos jugado por cuestiones m s espinosas
4336498 rech cese la incorporaci n al texto constitucional de un pre mbulo por no contar las iniciativas citadas con la habilitaci n legal correspondiente
4336499 art el estado provincial reconoce la salud como derecho humano fundamental de las personas y garantiza la promoci n protecci n recuperaci n y rehabilitaci n de la salud incluyendo el control de los riesgos biol gicos y socio ambientales de todas las personas desde su concepci n para prevenir la posibilidad de enfermedad o muerte por causas que se pueden evitar

4336530 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4336531 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4336532 pese a que la gente prefiere quedarse en el centro la actividad en el recinto se ha dinamizado algo m s este a o
4336533 el s bado 9 nos vimos desbordados por el impresionante aluvi n de gente pero el resto de la semana ha estado m s tranquila
4336534 posiblemente los conciertos programados no han estado a la altura o no cumpl an las expectativas de la gente que se acercaba hasta all
4336535 que la feria taurina ha sido floja y eso se ha visto reflejado en la t mida entrada que se ha registrado este a o
4336536 en un san lorenzo que ha ca do mal en el calendario toda la actividad se concentr el primer fin de semana y entre semana la afluencia al recinto ha sido considerablemente menor

4336542 se podr a negociar con el ayuntamiento un acercamiento del recinto al centro de la ciudad aunque esto suponga poner l mites a los horarios de cierre
4336543 estar contento por como han transcurrido las fiestas en las que no ha habido que lamentar incidentes de importancia
4336544 hizo que se estuviera muy a gusto en este espacio donde la m sica de unas pe as no hac a interferencias a las otras
4336545 que la gente se va acostumbrando poco a poco a esta ubicaci n de las pe as y si antes bajaban dos noches ahora se animan a pasarse tres

4336554 der kader ist so ausgeglichen dass sich keiner zur cklehnen kann es geht schon im training zur sache von der aggressivit t werden wir sicher profitieren
4336555 how do we know things how do we decide that something is true
4336556 athletes are continually in a dialogue or negotiation with themselves assessing how fatigued they feel
4336557 adept runners are faster due to their underlying physiological capacity rather than because they put more relative effort into their competition
4336558 when you prepare and go out and run a 10 k the person who wins is probably not running harder
4336559 to me what they are saying is there is a protective system built in that doesnt allow us to overuse our muscles
4336560 when you do something repetitive the body knows how to prevent injury
4336561 is a learned pattern of behavior and the muscles get regulated subconsciously by the brain
4336562 it gives us hope we arent going to kill ourselves
4336563 the absolute triumph of the will turns out to be a ghastly and unstable concept antithetical to the very happiness it so ardently seeks
4336564 what forms the soul and makes it interesting and capable of work and love and responsibility and happiness is not the triumph of the will but the triumph over self absorption and narcissism a triumph that always entails the defeat of the will

4336574 i believe the children are our future teach them well and let them lead the way
4336575 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4336576 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4336577 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4336578 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4336579 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays

4336585 fire eagle is a simple service a place where you can store information about your location you can share that location with any service in the world
4336586 at the moment we are focusing on development of the platform we have so many possibilities that our priority is to make sure that happens everyone in the ecosystem benefits the larger it gets
4336587 the premise is very simple what interesting services could you make if you had access to location information
4336588 every one of our content providers benefits from the fact that were doing fire eagle location because consumers set their location easily or rely on the fact that they set their location once and use it anywhere
4336589 when you accurately know where somebody is you can more accurately apply content and advertising to a situation and that advertising becomes more relevant and that moves away from being advertising becomes more relevant to what the user is interested in and what they might do
4336590 you can control your level of privacy you can change that level of privacy to the neighborhood exact location or hide yourself information still comes to fire eagle but none of it goes out anywhere

4336606 this is information about a ballistic missile attack this area is being targeted for an attack
4336607 our goal is to win every game with an emphasis on the greater western ohio conference south division
4336608 on paper i think were a very good football team the key is how soon do we gel last year it took us seven games
4336609 this year we need to get started with a win and carry that over to week two
4336610 our schedule may be the toughest weve ever had and each game gets tougher as the year goes on we have to get off to a good start
4336611 he is trusting his instincts and just playing the game at the quarterback position you have to relax just play the game and let your ability take care of the rest
4336612 we have four kids who have never started a varsity game but physically they are mature enough to be a very good offensive line
4336613 our most important key is to be efficient we need to get first downs move the ball and win field position
4336614 last year we left them on the field for too long this year we want to keep them fresh the more successful our offense is the more our defense can take chances and have more opportunities to make plays
4336615 we certainly graduated a lot of guys but the guys we have stepping in had tremendous success at the junior varsity and freshman levels
4336616 we feel we have the team to keep things going its just a matter of growing up filling their roles and eliminating mistakes
4336617 matt is a good passer hes tall he sees the field well and what he does best is understand the offense and know how to read a defenses he may do that better than any quarterback that ive ever coached
4336618 because of matts ability to read a defense our wide receivers have to be ready for the football on every snap at any given time the ball could be headed their way and they have to be ready to make plays when its thrown to them
4336619 well give them an equal distributiion to keep fresh legs
4336620 we have a very talented seven standing up and if our defensive line can get pressure on the quarterback and penetrate into the backfield our defense will make a lot of plays
4336621 and josh makes plays all over the field we use him in the flats at the line of scrimmage and in coverage were excited about how were able to use him

4336630 she went on living the remainder of her life here as she always did
4336631 when she was drifting in and out of consciousness in her own bed at home i spent a lot of time with her talking with her
4336632 to die with dignity is extremely important i wish that for everyone but it wasnt until i witnessed my mothers own passing that i learned what it meant to die with grace even at the end of her life she never stopped being a mother she never stopped teaching her children
4336633 my beloved grandmother was diagnosed with congestive heart failure not long after her 100th birthday
4336634 i left my job in another state and took her from the hospital to do in home hospice care it was her wish to die at home and i felt i had to honor that wish rather than allow her to be placed in a nursing home
4336635 in the month i had with her before she died she told me many tales of her life that i had never heard before
4336636 before she slipped into a coma i videotaped her singing one of her favorite songs
4336637 immediately after her death i kept leaping out of bed thinking that i heard her calling my name as she had when she was dying in a hospital bed at home a few months later i dreamed that she came to me and assured me that she was doing fine i felt great relief that her suffering was over now when i dream of her she is laughing singing and dancing it reminds me that i should do the same while i can

4336647 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4336648 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4336649 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4336650 the ark of the god of israel must not stay here with us because his hand is heavy upon us and upon dagon our god

4336680 should church members violate these rules they will be subject to the disciplinary actions of the chinese government
4336681 pastors were forced to sign a written agreement that they would not participate in religious services while the olympic games are taking place in china
4336682 refrain from organizing and joining illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from overseas religious organizations and groups that have a purpose
4336683 provides further evidence of the prcs hypocrisy towards creating a harmonious society marked by religious freedom and rule of law
4336684 the fact the document was issued while the worlds focus is on china is a blatant challenge to the international community and an apathetic stance toward seeking to correct human rights violations
4336685 if china is seeking to put on the mantle of a world superpower it must first acknowledge the unalienable rights of its own people caa calls on the international community and those concerned to voice their complaint to the relevant chinese government authorities
4336686 people who illegally distribute religious publications and video audio materials
4336687 people who have illegally established both in china and abroad religious organizations institutions schools sermon sites and other religious entities

4336690 going to a blended mode you can still get that same performance almost the same or nearly identical environmental benefits but much decreased cost
4336691 we had the knowledge base from the ev1 we knew how to do electrically propelled vehicles
4336692 theres a lot of things we can do in the near term and a lot of things we can do in the further term theres a lot more to go in terms of efficiency improvements
4336693 it would be really stupid to make a sequential decision around a hybrid in a commodore before we have efficiency in the base architecture done im talking about all the pieces to get an efficient platform
4336694 we want to give whats important to the customers which is the operating efficiency of a small car in a large car
4336695 if we have a mindset that we have to go after every gram the opportunity there is quite large
4336696 mass begets mass so the bigger the car is the more massive the car is the bigger the brakes are the more you have to press the throttle it just goes on and on
4336697 they make food taste better theyre calorie free and most are anti inflammatory

4336706 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4336707 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4336708 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4336709 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4336710 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
4336711 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it
4336712 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
4336713 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
4336714 i threw the ring at her and she said yes
4336715 anita y el paisaje social cubano la dictadura de machado s dejaron eco en sus cr nicas para esquire y piezas de ficci n
4336716 cuba es esa larga bella y desdichada isla frente a la que se deslizaba incansable la corriente
4336717 todo artista le debe al lugar que mejor conoce el destruirlo o perpetuarlo
4336718 no la asignaci n de plazas porque la mayor a se las guard elba esther gordillo l der del sindicato nacional de trabajadores de la educaci n y sus caciques sino el mapa de su impunidad y corrupci n ante el creciente descr dito que acumula en la base magisterial
4336719 no s lo es mera simulaci n sino un term metro del enorme repudio que generan las iniciativas de gordillo y su pandilla porque no s lo en michoac n oaxaca zacatecas coahuila y guerrero enfrent enorme resistencia en todo el pa s disminuy la presencia de aspirantes pues hubo escuelas donde no acudi ni la mitad de los inscritos
4336720 no cumpl an los requisitos los cuales ni siquiera se dieron a conocer en la convocatoria estatal lo que gener falsas expectativas y enojo
4336721 nunca aceptar como sus dirigentes a quienes por casi 20 a os han tenido sumidos en el abandono los derechos laborales de los maestros y han impulsado reformas para acabar con la escuela p blica y laica
4336722 resulta parad jico pues cuando m s profesores requiere el sistema para cubrir las aulas menos espacios se reconocen oficialmente
4336723 prevalece gran desconfianza sobre los organizadores de dicho concurso y los mecanismos empleados para su aplicaci n y evaluaci n al elegir a una organizaci n civil a modo para que certifique el proceso sino tambi n porque en los hechos se quieren lavar las manos y cerrar de manera definitiva la posibilidad de ingreso al servicio docente a los miles de egresados de normales e instituciones p blicas de educaci n superior
4336724 no s lo incumple las condiciones m nimas de transparencia exigidas en cualquier pr ctica de evaluaci n educativa que debe estar a cargo de organismos independientes se trata de un examen at pico que va en contra de los principios rectores de un ejercicio similar en cualquier parte del mundo pues no se garantiz la completa autonom a de un comit de verdaderos expertos ajenos a los intereses de las partes
4336725 apenas est n presentando un programa educativo y adem s no plantea la gran soluci n la cual no es aplicar ex menes
4336726 c mo se puede tener a dos se oras jal ndose del chongo en la sep ah hay dos secretarias y sobra alguna
4336727 defender los derechos de sus agremiados pero no tiene atributos de autoridad ni administrativos y si se convierte en autoridad echamos a perder todo
4336728 y si contamos seis a os con fox y dos del actual gobierno es lo que llevamos de vivir un desastre educativo social de salud en todo la nica soluci n es que felipe calder n se vaya con todo su
4336729 opaco y discrecional no s lo asistimos a una simulaci n sino tambi n a la ruptura de un mecanismo de vinculaci n entre los egresados de escuelas normales y universidades p blicas con el espacio directo para ejercer la docencia que es la escuela al destacar que se tienen muy pocas posibilidades de ingreso y con ello a la absorci n de una oferta de docentes que ya no podr n llegar a las aulas
4336730 la convocatoria s lo incluye la programaci n detallada que emerge del presupuesto de egresos de la federaci n 2008 toda la vacancia de los estados la que es parte de la plantilla ordinaria y que queda libre o puede quedar libre de manera temporal hasta donde he visto nadie la ha puesto
4336731 se da un pacto unilateral y obviamente estamos frente a un problema de verdad que es el hecho de que la implementaci n de la alianza s nos necesita a los estados pero si vamos a ser empleado o simples pagadores de sus proyectos y programas indudablemente esto va a tener poco xito
4336732 si mi estimaci n es correcta la mitad de las plazas no se estar an renovando por la v a del concurso
4336733 si la tasa de renovaci n del sistema educativo es del 4 por ciento de los 970 mil maestros de escuelas p blicas significa como 40 mil plazas entre vacantes por diferentes motivos y de nueva creaci n
4336734 quiere decir que los sistemas estatales no est n poniendo sus plazas por eso ser a muy conveniente que la alianza diera a conocer cu ntas plazas vacantes se dan al a o por entidad porque las 25 mil plazas anunciadas representa tan s lo 2 por ciento del total
4336735 hay una decisi n fundamental que tomamos el s bado con el sindicato se acord que a partir del examen todas las plazas que se van a proponer en la secretar a todas ser n bajo el examen de oposici n
4336736 los que no puedan ser contratados en este periodo normalmente los maestros su prejubilatorio lo presentan en octubre pero ya tendremos presentado el examen por los alumnos y yo espero un promedio de 300 jubilaciones en octubre y ah podremos colocar a varios de los aspirantes que no encontraran espacio este d a
4336737 nosotros estamos obedeciendo totalmente la convocatoria y esperamos que se va a respetar por eso es porque se estableci este comit
4336738 conocer los trabajos y la forma en que se realiza un proceso como ste esperamos transparencia e igualdad a la hora de evaluar
4336739 aqu en la entidad todo se est haciendo con transparencia y de acuerdo a los lineamientos de la sep
4336740 uno es para los maestros que no tienen ninguna plaza y la otra es para los maestros que son interinos aunque finalmente tendr amos que sujetarnos a los propios acuerdos que la comisi n nacional acordara
4336741 estamos observando el proceso y la transparencia de este mecanismo de trabajo
4336742 tenemos que detectar todos los casos para ver cu les son casos que s se justifican legalmente para que no les quiten su trabajo hay otros que no se justifican cada caso es diferente y se tienen que ver de manera individual
4336743 tenemos que hablar con cada uno de ellos para ver cu l es el caso y cuando haya justificaci n entrar a la defensa del profesor
4336744 esto va en dem rito del servicio educativo pero la revisi n la har n los responsables del rea de conflicto de las secciones con la secretar a de educaci n nombre por nombre
4336745 ellos quedan un poco maniatados porque no tienen la formaci n de docentes la convocatoria limit a muchos por el candado que present la propia instituci n pero en esos casos como ya es algo que el trabajador ya ten a tenemos que negociarlo con secretar a
4336746 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now

4336766 the african american community is as american as apple pie
4336767 notice of plaintiff michael savages decision not to file an amended complaint as to rico cause of action
4336768 it is obvious that mr savage finally came to realize that his bizarre and frivolous smears would not stand up in a court of law it is a pity that he does not show as much common sense while spewing invective daily against religious ethnic and even medical minorities on his hate radio program
4336769 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
4336770 he always went out of his way to help people
4336771 so many of us are still trying to figure out our purpose in this life
4336772 were aware of the situation we are looking into it and have no further comment
4336773 fort hays does not condone the language or the behavior in that video
4336774 its not my place to be part of this debate
4336775 sometimes people care so much that it bubbles over im not ashamed of my behavior
4336776 i dont think im acting immaturely i think im showing how much i care about everybody in this room
4336777 its possible these sorts of things have happened often but they werent brought to our attention
4336778 youtube brings these sorts of things into our living rooms
4336779 in effect 200 ross street became the general headquarters of pittsburghs first renaissance
4336780 is it better for the taxpayers of the city of pittsburgh to own the building or better to look to the private market for other uses
4336781 whether real or perceived any thought of bias on race or gender is unacceptable
4336782 joy stated that he believes that the actors are either students at the art institute or fellow teachers or professors
4336783 he stated that he is not well liked there due to him having his ph d and other teachers make less money than him
4336784 ultimately clearing the way for darla lavalle to pay herself as she saw fit
4336785 while this amount repaid some of the excess salary and excess pension benefit she took in 2005 2006 and 2007 it failed to restore the total sums stolen and completely neglected the pension thefts from 1993 to 2004 or her misappropriation by failure to pay into the other employees pension plans
4336786 all of the monies collected during the relevant time frame could become taxable and the agency would be liable for that amount
4336787 we have some schools that didnt make ayp that had a wonderful year

4336796 what we are seeing is a lot of commodity price spillover
4336797 were probably looking in the rearview mirror with respect to the worst part of inflation
4336798 as soon as possible to view and re inspect the progress we have made
4336799 as long as im here there will never be another provisional license and i can say with a degree of certainty that the staff feels the same way
4336800 staff that were interviewed also indicated that it was common for one staff to walk to another area of the building with a group of more than six residents
4336801 if your staffing ratio is out of compliance you can have a pretty serious situation on your hands that gets out of control very quickly those extra two kids can become an overpowering force to the staff there
4336802 we were under the impression that we could correct that by the end of the shift
4336803 nearly all of the staff described a disconnect with the administration
4336804 they do not feel that issues that are brought to administrative staff attention are being addressed and stated this is another reason why morale is low among staff
4336805 nearly one half inch of dust on it at the time of the walk through
4336806 with a residents room having water inside covering 75 percent of the floor
4336807 we had previously indicated that we would review any new information that was brought forward
4336808 during the dependency hearing another theory was advocated concerning the death of this infant and we will look at that theory
4336809 is the case closed or do we go to a different plan
4336810 weve been saying all along that there are a lot of questions that arent answered we need some explanation thats the least we deserve
4336811 we are excited to get rolling it should be a great project
4336812 i have mixed emotions about how things turned out but it was the best under the circumstances i am pleased the board approved this license transfer and that construction will resume
4336813 i dont agree with people who say this license should be revoked and rebid
4336814 that would be disastrous for thousands of families of construction workers and for the city allegheny county and the state
4336815 we took a deliberate stance and made sure we understood everything even though we faced a storm of criticism
4336816 i think were far beyond the debate on whether gambling is right or wrong for pennsylvania the reality is its coming now we as city residents and myself as mayor have to deal with those ramifications
4336817 theres going to be negatives associated with it we all know that but i think if we plan and prepare for it it will allow us to be more successful
4336818 were looking at a new casino next year in 2009 and then a new arena the following year so i think that overall today is one of the more exciting days in the city of pittsburghs history
4336819 i dont see this team ever leaving this is a great hockey market
4336820 its been a long time coming its something thats exciting for all of us
4336821 it was a painful process but the end result was worth it

4336830 when this thing comes out its going to be shocking ive never seen anything like this before
4336831 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4336832 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4336833 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect even if the carcass had have been eviscerated by a predator or a scavenger the entrails wouldnt just be sitting up on top like that
4336834 hes hunted hes wanted this is not what i would call living the good life
4336835 i know when i should dial down and not ask
4336836 is not a criminal he was bothered by what he saw at the bank
4336837 somewhat puzzled that kieber is now considered a whistle blower
4336838 its kind of quiet in the middle of the week
4336839 somewhere in the world is a person who looks just like you
4336840 the aussie is really struggling to breathe at the moment it appears mr botros said
4336841 the us dollar has been rallying one more day of this and weve confirmed a fortnights worth of us dollar strength across the board mr botros said

4336843 the market is heavily centred on selling on rallies mr botros said

4336846 what happens if i fart while im peeing should i make a joke about it
4336847 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play
4336848 i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4336849 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4336850 swirled amp squo amp squo internet images of a man abusing boys
4336851 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones
4336852 i will carry this with me for the rest of my life
4336853 he looked me in the eye and told me he was sorry
4336854 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4336855 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4336856 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4336857 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4336858 we needed to be dynamic and show more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4336859 im a prude so dont touch me above the knee
4336860 when youre trying to recover affordability levels from 24 year lows youre going to need quite some period of time of sustained improvement to make it easier for first time buyers
4336861 i hope that this match will be for us very important
4336862 i hope from baku they will travel directly to wales and everything will be ok
4336863 most of the georgian players are playing in europe so they will arrive from their clubs
4336864 chelsea football club can confirm that it has received the decision from fifas dispute resolution chamber drc on the claim made against adrian mutu
4336865 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68 million in compensation
4336866 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4336867 chelsea will now be following the process laid out in the drcs decision to claim the money from mutu
4336868 that value was 13 million but when we made our case to fifa we did not ask for a specific amount
4336869 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4336870 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4336871 he took the types of classes people who want to change the world took

4336877 but in the meantime think about what kind of lifestyle changes you can make
4336878 well we told you about your high blood pressure so you should have known better than to hurt yourself and were going to refuse to treat you
4336879 despite my acquittal it is easy to see that voters can have doubts about my character given what the media unfairly wrote about me
4336880 their tabloid like reporting has tarnished my reputation in this community and made it more difficult to seek re election
4336881 stop it this makes me sick this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
4336882 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed

4336885 i believe weve crossed the rubicon and established the premise the investors will be helped
4336886 the nightmare will end and they will be made whole
4336887 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
4336888 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4336889 is something about how games are designed to trigger learning that makes them so deeply motivating
4336890 the designers of many good games have hit on profoundly good methods of getting people to learn and to enjoy learning they have had to since the games that were bad at getting themselves learned didnt get played and the companies that made them lost money
4336891 hey dudes could you please take me to the entrance now need to get to work

4336898 there is a good reason for users of software to feel a moral obligation to contribute to its support developers of free software are contributing to the users activities and it is both fair and in the long term interest of the users to give them funds to continue
4336899 disability is never the problem its barriers in the outside world including barriers of attitude that are the problem

4336906 the combination of the two modes communicates different things that neither of the modes does separately

4336910 in the past 20 years a lot of seafood has gone from luxury items to commodities
4336911 we cant all expect to have all you can eat shrimp for 9 99 we couldnt have all you can eat grizzly bear either there are just some things that arent generating that way
4336912 kalau abdul khalid tidak tarik balik kenyataan beliau semua warga uitm akan mengadakan perhimpunan besar besaran di shah alam

4336914 savory has come to mean the opposite of sweet to many people just because something isnt sweet doesnt make it umami
4336915 if youre eating meat you dont necessarily need something to convince you that youre eating protein
4336916 is the other four tastes arose to deal with really significant problems having to do with recognizing calories recognizing sodium which is crucial for life and avoiding getting poisoned and maybe umami is the protein signal
4336917 in japan broth prepared by dried seaweed konbu demonstrates to us a simple umami taste
4336918 the sensory descriptions of umami have been things like tastes like chicken soup
4336919 honestly i dont think people really know what it is about the taste of meat that makes it so attractive
4336920 people want to think that their food is grown by some guy who looks like jesus along with his wife and children
4336921 a way to make a statement to his farmer colleagues
4336922 he also had a belief that union representation was a way of formalizing a relationship that he already had with workers which was more one of partnership that what you see on a lot of farms
4336923 our production has grown and the union contract has not hindered that growth in any way
4336924 theres this idea that unionized workers make all this money
4336925 its still an agricultural operation and we have to compete in the marketplace but i would say that our overall labor costs are significantly higher due to the benefits and the eventual higher wage rates because people stick around and end up earning more
4336926 six hours is fine but you do seven eight or nine and youre really tired
4336927 lots of people want the union but theyre worried that the bosses wont give them any work
4336928 were behind most other parts of the world on this issue
4336929 farmers are broken down sons of the earth men of honor struggling mightily against all odds
4336930 growers are serial abusers of people you get a choice if youre a farmer its great if youre a grower you just suck
4336931 first people are always more responsive to peer pressure than to outside regulations secondly we have market forces we havent paid minimum wage in years if we paid minimum wage we wouldnt have any workers at all
4336932 but most of them realize that for this to have a realistic impact on farmworkers in general 90 percent of whom dont work on organic farms we need to have a broader vision
4336933 california is always on the tongues of people talking about domestic fair trade
4336934 the organic premium you get in the midwest is based on the california price so theres a lot of talk about how none of this work is going to do any good unless we get california on board
4336935 ich sehe sie werfen einen blick auf ihre uhr sind sie im zeitdruck
4336936 we help orphan kids find godmothers or be adopted we help widows to find work we help anyone who is in trouble
4336937 not only does it work well and bring results but its also thanks to the association that the band was formed
4336938 we included electric guitars to help our brothers and sisters in other countries hear our message
4336939 theyre exposed to the wind the sun the sand and protect their faces
4336940 im such a nomad that in my room i move my bed every night
4336941 others will be killed by a compliment you and your partner might be taken down by an innocent group cheer
4336942 so this notion that games are little things that live on screens that we have to keep compartmentalized is really weird and recent
4336943 i want to take all the things coming out of online gaming and computer gaming and video gaming and figure out how to map that onto real life
4336944 there were people looking at play and games in the 60s and 70s within performance studies and it was kind of murky
4336945 now that were actually playing real games all the time im convinced that thats going to completely change the way people form their identities and their relationships
4336946 to the extent that games are escapist today i think its because we lack all those forms of engagement and that structure
4336947 so my mission is to figure out how to make real communities as engaging and responsive as online environments
4336948 but we havent had technology that is as democratic as the ideals of the government
4336949 i just wanted to get down the idea of the melody to show the others and i didnt really want to pick up an instrument so i just grabbed the mic and whistled
4336950 you have to listen carefully so you dont erase something good you stumble on the best things and then you have to decide to stick to it thats the hard part
4336951 its kind of like the little tin pan alley of stockholm
4336952 we didnt plan to be touring this much not at all
4336953 we thought maybe wed do an opener in england for some white stripe rip off band and then wed just go home
4336954 we are living the dream as much as you can as settled down 30 year olds enjoying the gigs very much but also missing our girlfriends
4336955 surfings like the mafia once youre in youre not getting out

4336958 in the last elections kadima dressed itself up as a centrist party but this plan clearly shows it is on the extreme left
4336959 i have never been so scared in my life we hid until the jewish agency sent a taxi for us the next day
4336960 we felt safer in tblisi the worst thing was that we saw on the television our home and it had been hit again even harder we probably would have been killed had we stayed in gori
4336961 everybody knows people who have been killed there when we left we took a small bag for the three of us and i have arrived with just the clothes i am wearing
4336962 what is happening in gori is unbelievable the russians are killing innocent civilians in cold blood with their bombs the casualties are far higher than the international press is reporting i havent got a friend who did not have a family member killed my best friends husband was killed
4336963 on saturday we came out of hiding in our basement and put a few things in the car and drove to tblisi we felt very vulnerable and expected to be blown up any minute
4336964 our main worry was that the airport would remain closed because the russians were bombing it it seemed like a miracle when we were put on a plane and we took off
4336965 it sounds silly when so many people are dying but im really upset about my dog jenny there is nobody to look after her
4336966 brought upon israel the repercussions of disengagement the second lebanon war and a series of embarrassing scandals im not convinced that the foreign minister has what it takes to provide answers on the really important security issues that a prime minister is responsible for
4336967 was it lost forever the day sharon had his stroke
4336968 we have been left with a party of posters and no content
4336969 at one point his heartbeat appeared to have stopped i slept on a chair by his bed for four nights and for nine days i didnt even get to see my other two children seven year old rafi and cobi five but the doctors and their teams were phenomenal and they pulled him through i cant praise them highly enough
4336970 all the pupils at hertsmere jewish primary plus the kids at rosh pinah and the menorah foundation school in edgware and even the children in an amsterdam school to which my husbands family has links
4336971 an amazing little boy a real fighter despite all his problems he has developed normally apart from being a little underweight he s a typical two year old attempting to imitate everything his older brothers do
4336972 no tengo nada que ver con estas decisiones ni me interesa y me equivocar a si me metiera en esos temas no dejo de decir que me gusta que me agrada la pol tica pero hoy s que mi rol no es ser delantero mi rol es formar parte de un equipo t cnico a otros personajes a otros les toca estar en la cancha son otros los que tienen que meter los goles llevarse los aplausos otros los que tienen que jugar y aparecer en los peri dicos

4336974 we are doubling the capacity not least to accommodate children
4336975 we are very excited with the results of this study and are planning to meet with the u s food and drug administration fda in the fourth quarter of this year to discuss the results of this study and determine the next steps in the submission of a new drug application nda for ipx056
4336976 such spasticity treatments represent a 1 6 billion market in the u s and ipx056 may fill an unmet medical need in these patients
4336977 we are very pleased with the progress we have made in advancing our proprietary brand products and expect to continue this progress with an expansion in our r amp d staff this year the cns space is ideally suited to our core competency in drug delivery as so many products are candidates for improved dosing and administration and the market is large and growing at almost 10 annually faster than the total u s pharmaceutical market in addition the neurology market is readily addressable by a small and focused sales force given the concentration of physicians writing prescriptions we currently have 66 specialty sales representatives to market our products and to serve as a contract force for others
4336978 glaxosmithkline carefully considers any new information on our medicines and we are working closely with actg to understand why our analyses found conflicting results
4336979 this analysis based on similar criteria to that utilized in actg 5202 demonstrates that epzicom continues to be an effective treatment option for treatment naive patients as always physicians must consider each patients individual health and treatment history when making treatment decisions
4336980 as smoking is a well recognized modifiable amd risk factor smoking cessation is an important public health measure to reduce amd particularly among japanese men
4336981 this protective effect suggests that a public health measure aimed at preventing development of myopia could be based on increasing the engagement of children in outdoor activity
4336982 topical interferon alfa 2 b and aggressive surgical excision can both be considered effective treatments for ossn
4336983 the result of the heat trial further demonstrates that epzicom is an effective first line option for treatment naive hiv patients with a well established safety profile
4336984 this study provides the first head to head completed study comparing these two hiv treatments and demonstrates comparable results between the two

4336994 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4336995 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4336996 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect even if the carcass had have been eviscerated by a predator or a scavenger the entrails wouldnt just be sitting up on top like that
4336997 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones
4336998 i will carry this with me for the rest of my life

4337034 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4337036 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4337037 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4337038 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4337039 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4337040 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4337063 the great thing about this space what really sold me on it was this walled garden its a special place a haven from the hustle and bustle of the city when youre sitting down out there you dont see the neighbours at all you feel youre in a little courtyard in italy so this is my favourite space in the whole house

4337074 and they dont think of any style and so you explained to them how the building would work best and how it would be the most economic way to put together and then they said okay and then it was finished and it was modern

4337304 self righteous individuals who maintain a strong acceptance of traditional values and norms possess a general willingness to submit to authority and display a general tendency to aggress against others especially those who threaten their conventional and traditional values

4337310 make no mistake our message is simple and we have explained it over and over drunk driving is simply not worth the risk of killing yourself or killing someone else
4337311 nor is it worth the financial cost of the crash there are thousands of dollars in associated penalties if you are convicted

4337317 a lei de anistia dirigida aos militantes pol ticos essa interpreta o de que ela tamb m serviria aos militares apenas uma interpreta o e n o h necessidade de nenhuma revis o
4337318 o trabalho de investiga o criminal precisa ter muita seguran a com rela o autoria ou seja o mpf s pode processar quando tem elementos fortes veementes de que h uma autoria identificada

4337320 a discuss o sobre a revis o da lei da anistia repercutiu mal como um ato de revanchismo do ministro tarso n o vejo o governo lula do presidente luiz in cio lula da silva envolvido nisso

4337331 legislator lois bronz who represents the area was the prime mover for this important investment for westchester county
4337332 we must do everything we can to protect existing affordable housing and this is an excellent project that allows us to do that

4337334 it is particularly important that residents remain vigilant in their efforts to reduce their risk of west nile virus particularly now during peak mosquito season
4337335 it is also important that residents do their part to reduce potential mosquito breeding sites around their homes
4337336 mosquitoes capable of carrying west nile virus lay their eggs in stagnant water the eggs can develop in any pool or puddle of untreated water that stands undisturbed for more than four days

4337343 working together is fun and rewarding i prefer working on one big project together
4337344 planning a one day project for nearly 400 volunteers has been interesting but very fun
4337345 we are pleased to be collaborating with the church volunteers on this exciting new project for arvada although this additional trail was planned the offer of assistance from the church certainly is making it a reality much sooner than expected and it is estimated volunteers saved the city about 15 000
4337346 craig hillegass and all of the city staff have been exceptional to work with
4337347 we got him in to the hut and got him comfortable but i think it happened pretty fast
4337348 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4337349 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4337350 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4337351 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4337352 once the inventory is drawn down price pressure will return because the costs of construction are rising
4337353 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4337354 i think buyers are a bit edgy about the russia georgia situation knowing thats not completely resolved theyre looking for some geopolitical risk premium
4337355 we cannot afford to take a wait and see attitude toward the market
4337356 we must proactively evaluate every aspect of our organization to ensure that we are prepared to provide a large volume of new plants throughout the world
4337357 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4337358 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4337359 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4337360 the process begins way before there are problems in the market
4337361 the scaredy cat is the person whos going to dominate he or she is not going to leave the other alone thats just reality
4337362 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4337363 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4337364 i hope well be able to pay them but we cant promise it
4337365 it is with no options and great sadness that we will cease operations please keep the families whose lives depended on jenny lee bakery in your thoughts and prayers
4337366 what we are seeing is a lot of commodity price spillover
4337367 were probably looking in the rearview mirror with respect to the worst part of inflation
4337368 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
4337369 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way
4337370 the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
4337371 to suggest ive given the project my seal of approval
4337372 me parece un poco dif cil calcular el n mero de perros en india por no hablar de los censos de buitres que no son fiables ni en espa a
4337373 el diclofenaco ha sido una cat strofe en india y el papel de estas aves en los ecosistemas es fundamental es un ejemplo de reacci n en cadena

4337375 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number

4337377 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4337378 deep concern over the deteriorating situation in indian occupied kashmir
4337379 oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus standi
4337380 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4337381 once every 10 to 15 years one sort of rises up like a phoenix who is born to do what they do
4337382 the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future
4337383 the nabucco pipeline now is dependent not only on gas from the caucuses and from east of the caspian but also from iran
4337384 this goes against the whole concept of nabucco that it would not be either russian or russian controlled gas
4337385 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4337386 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4337387 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4337388 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4337389 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy
4337390 i can tell blah blah blah long list of stupid assumptions keep letting the real american men amp women protect our nation
4337391 with his doctrine of preemptive warfare bush single handedly tore down the architecture of post world war ii international law erected by the founders of the united nations to ensure that rogue states did not go about launching wars of aggression the way hitler had
4337392 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4337393 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4337394 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4337395 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4337396 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4337397 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4337398 our role in the government will be to accomplish the historical task of writing a new constitution and fulfill the peoples desire of progressive transformation of the country
4337399 todays candidacy has confirmed that there would be a national government commanding a two third majority so the nc understanding this ground reality should join the government
4337400 i will again request nc for the same and i hope nc will join us
4337401 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works
4337402 in c amp c3 it was understandable due to stealth units but there arent any
4337403 john mccain has shifted gears under his new karl rove led management team and comes out swinging with a negative olympics campaign that is dramatically in conflict with the olympic spirit
4337404 so unfocused and indirect that it is lost and in my opinion worthless
4337405 since the last bull market was all about financials i do not expect them to lead the next cyclical bull
4337406 no you dont know me but i read your blogs and looked at your pictures and i think youre great wanted to send a message of support
4337407 ann wilson schaef writes that anything can be used addictively whether it be a substance like alcohol or a process like work
4337408 teens are only fooling themselves when they believe they know what love is
4337409 i know that not race alone not color alone but the daily values that give meaning to life stood between me and those white girls with whom i worked their constant outward looking their mania for radios cars and a thousand other trinkets made them dream and fix their eyes upon the trash of life made it impossible for them to learn a language which could have taught them to speak of what was in their or others hearts the words of their souls were the syllables of popular songs
4337410 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
4337411 the beauty of the evil dead movies is that youre only appealing to one demographic and thats people who like horror movies and you just have to please them you dont have to appeal to the studio youre already pleasing them by giving them part 4
4337412 evil dead 4 will stick to its roots and not fall in line with the rest of the recycled crap
4337413 sam raimi gets to hide behind the camera i cant but i think hes planning on factoring that in
4337414 as like a major factor itd be a major liability you know ash runs out of breath or his back goes out and stuff like that i mean i just blew my hamstring fighting a stunt guy for burn notice the show that im doing now so theres a little bit of truth to all of that
4337415 so it was that the beggar died and was carried by the angels to abrahams bosom
4337416 dejan if i had known then what i know now in this place i would have lived my life completely different you must live and continue to follow where your heart is leading you dont waste time
4337417 if you think i got up today and aimed to impress you youre sadly mistaken

4337427 if you accept for doctrine the commandments of men then you are not following yahweh but men
4337428 nah i dont like that take it off and wear this pelt
4337429 did you post that picture wondering if someone would compare you to toby you must have thought you did wrong not even on a good day
4337430 besides this guy is fat in the face or he is getting ready to vomit probably cant hold his liquor
4337431 ok first of all you are not even close to looking like the man toby he is by far better looking and you cant compare to his looks the muscles the body the hair oh please tell that girl she made a huge mistake saying that about you
4337432 let me start off by saying it is almost hillarious you find it so offensive that someone compared your looks to toby keith covel i think you should have taken that as a very big compliment you should actually feel honored to say the least as to whomever compared your looks to his they really do need glasses and if they already have them they should go a step further and have corrective eye surgery becuse toby keith you couldnt compare to on you very best day
4337433 sweetie ive seen toby keith and you are no toby keith you might pass for him if you were 50 yards away at night a very dark night at that and we were blind likeyour dog how do you like me now
4337434 it is obvious to me that although you say you are insulted you were shooting for tobys look sorry to disappoint you sweetheart buy you couldnt hold a candle to the big dog so put your little puppy dog tail between your legs and go sulk somewhere someone cares
4337435 i guess it depends who is doing the viewing after a few drinks my husband starts to look like toby with my eyes closed lol
4337436 well thanxs alot you two now you done went and got me started to i wasnt gonna do it but you twisted my arm i tried to be a little bit easy on him i really did not
4337437 they are disgusting offensive and can only be described as evil he said
4337438 the protective effect of cigarette smoking and coffee in parkinsons disease is well established
4337439 we found patients with blepharospasm drank coffee less often than controls the other important result was the observation that for every additional cup of coffee consumed per day there was a delay in the age of onset of blepharospasm both findings support a protective effect nevertheless methodologically robust studies in independent populations are needed to confirm this hypothesis
4337440 the association of caffeine and bsp blepharospasm may be biologically plausible given the pro dopaminergic activity exerted by caffeine through an antagonistic action on adenosine receptors this has been called into play to explain the observed protective effect on the development of pd likewise a relative hypodopaminergic status has been proposed in the pathophysiology of bsp
4337441 i believe our data may have implications for the understanding of the etiology and treatment of primary bsp and that future studies seeking additional environmental or genetic factors for dystonia should take the effect of coffee into account
4337442 have you ever drunk non decaffeinated coffee or smoked cigarettes
4337443 dalam suatu negara harus hanya ada satu hukum yang tidak membedakan agama ras dan keyakinan gagasan gus dur semacam itu lah yang menurut sejumlah penulis buku ini musykilat dalam nu dinilai sebagai salah satu contoh sekularisme yang sedang dikembangkan ke dalam tubuh nu amsar a dulmanan koordinator forum generasi muda nu saat ini telah terjadi sekularisasi di tubuh nu buktinya banyak kalangan nu terutama kalangan mudanya yang dengan tegas menghendaki tatanan politik sekuler salah satu alasannya adalah akan terjadinya islam dan menjadikannya sebagai warga negara kelas dua ini akan mengancam terjadinya disintegrasi bangsa
4337444 sejauh yang aku amati selama ini agama terjadi telahl kehilangan daya
4337445 nah diam diam kita menganut sekularisme walaupun dengan lantang kita
4337446 sampai sekarang saya gagal memahami mengapa diantara kaum muslim masih saja ada yang menjadi penganjur sekularisasi seolah olah tidak mengetahui bahwa islam dan sekularisme terdapat antagonisme total
4337447 kami tidak mengutus engkau ya muhammad melainkan menjadi rahmat untuk semesta alam
4337448 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases

4337451 el pueblo boliviano quiere cambios profundos en lo estructural y en lo pol tico
4337452 no hay acuerdo en los contenidos de los temas en conflicto

4337454 para que haya soluciones concretas hay que generar las m nimas condiciones o de lo contrario nuevamente vamos a ser timados

4337460 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
4337461 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
4337462 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
4337463 perceptions of which foods should be eaten in moderation and an understanding of balancing a diet appear to be weak
4337464 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and household goods
4337465 it is therefore essential that we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
4337466 the big thing that is driving this phenomenon is broadband connections which the majority of people did not have a few years ago thats changed

4337468 its important to say that whats being parodied is certainly not any actual black human being but the ideas in the actors mind of what an african american would be
4337469 its a movie that was not afraid to go for it in every possible way
4337470 people were saying there was one good role for an african american actor and they gave it to robert downey jr they were saying with a straight face exactly what we were saying in the movie that felt great
4337471 for many years its been interesting to me how hollywood tends to romanticize
4337472 instead of looking at it in a realistic way theyve sort of fetishized it like oh wouldnt it be great if we were all retarded wouldnt that be like the perfect world to me one of the great moments is to be able to call it out you have to to understand why its absurd
4337473 you never saw someone as angry as he was after seeing forrest gump
4337474 he said you think its funny being raised by a person like that he learned to read by reading the comics to his father
4337475 theyd say its not kosher what are you doing cmon i always strongly disagreed the point of the show was to hold up a mirror to the way people act and the attitudes they have if you think its glorifying people sitting around on a couch the way they do youre probably missing the point
4337476 you laughed at it because it was a guy getting kicked in the balls and then you could laugh at it because it was a parody of the kinds of shows we all watched i hope tropic thunder works on that same level multifaceted with something for everybody to enjoy
4337477 thats why the guys a movie star its an amazing rediscovery of how funny he is
4337478 i was thinking oh my goodness i can see it now the chinese accused of harsh and brutal tactics against human rights protesters show that they serve kfc and tea to their prisoners they wanted to document our treatment
4337479 just as in other countries assemblies processions and demonstrations must be held according to relevant legal regulations and procedures and shall not be carried out without approval from relevant authorities

4337482 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4337483 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4337484 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4337485 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4337486 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4337487 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4337488 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4337489 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4337490 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4337491 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4337492 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4337493 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far

4337500 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving

4337509 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4337510 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4337511 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4337512 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4337513 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4337514 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4337515 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4337516 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4337517 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4337518 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4337519 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4337520 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4337521 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4337522 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4337523 he was just a baby just a baby he was like a shiny new penny all the love and happiness you ever saw
4337524 early indications are that he was drinking at a licensed establishment we are actively investigating that
4337525 an issue with his registration and he pleaded guilty to that as well
4337526 he said he had a love for serving the community
4337527 i cant tell you how many times when he was on duty he would put his arms out and say i take care of the community theyre my community
4337528 he exemplified the innocence of a new officer he was so innocent and yet he had that excitement about him
4337529 he would talk about the marine corps a lot and his desire to serve the community and to serve the public
4337530 i can tell you ive done a lot of those notifications and there has never been one that was more difficult
4337531 she told me she held her breath every day he was over there and finally felt a sense of relief
4337532 he loved god and his country and his family and friends
4337533 officer powers death was tragic and needless we all will miss him

4337546 i was having this dream that my matthew and i were both lost
4337547 when chief taylor called i thought i was still dreaming i was caught off guard
4337548 i still have not really soaked it in my matthew is alive
4337549 the campus police are the ones who tended to him and they said hes being held for 72 hours in what they called a healthcare facility
4337550 matthew is very slim and he looked disheveled and unkempt hes been living like a homeless person but i dont know how he acted or what his demeanor was when they found him
4337551 right now i am ecstatic i feel in awe i feel a burden has been lifted off my shoulders now that i know my matthew is alive
4337552 whatever happens the family is here for matthew we are right by his side we havent forsaken him at all
4337553 well my thinking in the first place is that matthew must have left out of stress or something peculiar in the first place im thinking stress we dont know
4337554 matthew always took it in stride before but with a 19 hour course load and working all day and all night on projects the lack of sleep and not eating all that would get to the best of us
4337555 if matthew was to come home fine but im not going to make him come home to live with me
4337556 i just want him to learn how to express his emotions if he is stressed say youre stressed dont let it build up so that it gets to this
4337557 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4337558 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4337559 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4337560 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4337561 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4337562 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4337563 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4337564 i cant get any kind of feedback if it remains only on my hard drive
4337565 holy mother church has firmly and with absolute constancy held and continues to hold that the four gospels just named whose historical character the church unhesitatingly asserts faithfully hand on what jesus christ while living among men really did and taught for their eternal salvation
4337566 themselves from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
4337567 i believe in order to understand and i understand the better to believe
4337568 what kind of relationship can you have with another person if you are always and already suspicious of the other person
4337569 because you did not trust in me to show my holiness before the eyes of the israelites therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that i have given them
4337570 what kind of conversation can a person enter into with another person when one is already suspicious of the other person and one is suspect of the conversation that will follow before the conversation even begins
4337571 what kind of conversation can we have with scripture if we enter into that conversation already suspicious of that conversation we are about to have
4337572 very soon mud is planning to begin full scale operation of high powered wells in its massive new platte west well field located in western douglas county
4337573 if mud begins full operation at this time it will place the drinking water of the omaha area at risk
4337574 we now know the threat is not actually contained and it is clear the corps doesnt know how far east the contamination extends
4337575 in light of this it is far too risky for mud to operate its massive new well field at this time
4337576 the permit issued to mud by the corps in 2003 acknowledges that the pumping could cause the contamination to move and get into the drinking water
4337577 instead of instructing mud to delay operations until the toxins are contained they are allowing mud to proceed
4337578 theyll let us know if there are any problems and if there are they will be corrected
4337579 it is very troubling that the corps continues to refuse to test all the residential wells in the vicinity of the eastern plume
4337580 the public does not have a network of monitoring wells that could serve as an effective early warning system to alert them when muds pumping draws the contamination farther east
4337581 neither the state nor the epa has conducted a study of the effect of muds maximum pumping reported to be at 160 million gallons per day when the stream flow in the platte river is low
4337582 neither have they conducted any independent groundwater modeling related to the mead superfund site toxins
4337583 it atmosphere was a little different because it is kind of a home game for us but is so close to pittsburgh that a lot of pittsburgh fans drove to the game
4337584 i think its going to do well for the nfl
4337585 we have to get the crowd a little bit more into it and it happens with time
4337586 when the regular season comes its going to be different because the first team will be out there for the whole game
4337587 but to be up here with the fans has been awesome
4337588 its an exhibition game and in buffalo these are 60 tickets and they want 500 for them here
4337589 id definitely be selling more tickets if i was at a hockey arena
4337590 he used to play there as a kid but there was always something about the place that spooked him
4337591 he loved his job but he knew this one was the most dangerous hed ever worked
4337592 its a very sad day for quincy its a day when a landmark has become a tragic memorial
4337593 it fell in the right direction it just did not fall at the right time
4337594 the first thing that ought to be noted is that romney is the most intellectually inconsistent politician
4337595 i think gov romneys game plan to become vice president is to get under the radar hes seen by many conservative republicans as more conservative than mccain
4337596 but there are things about his evolving positions on everything from abortion to gay rights that people need to know about
4337597 it shouldnt surprise anyone that bitterly divisive democrats like barney frank dont have anything good to say about republicans
4337598 i have been a private person always and id like to remain that way
4337599 this has been an ongoing thing for a long time but my children are involved and thats why it needs to be private
4337600 obviously weve got a number of new guys i think as we move along in the preseason things will define themselves even more i think we know more after the first game than we did before that i think we still just have to keep a close eye a lot of guys are going to get an opportunity they need to show what they can do
4337601 youd like to have them all out there every day but you know thats not how this thing works
4337602 when you dont have a guy or two out there it creates an opportunity for other guys to show what they can do thats where we are and some guys have taken advantage when given the chance theyve gone out and showed well so their stock has risen because of that
4337603 i think hes a bright young guy who has good instincts
4337604 he has very good speed he understands the game hes going to work on his weaknesses i think hes very coachable hes got the right attitude those kind of guys normally improve he understands he has a lot to learn
4337605 i think you can see his experience hes been a starting corner for a number of years in this league
4337606 the one thing about this league veteran guys can grow on their different experiences while rookies havent had those experiences yet i think it helps fernando be a smart pro
4337607 hes on short duty and its been ups and downs for bartolo
4337608 the last time we shut him down after three this next time we are looking for four innings and 60 pitches
4337609 last year he would have an inning where he would give up a double or have men at second and third and he would let things spin out of control
4337610 this year he might give up a run but hes a damage control pitcher now and he did that the other day in fenway park
4337611 were right where we want to be and that has everyone excited
4337612 i cant write a check big enough for all the jimmy fund has done for us
4337613 he can help me with opening doors retrieving objects stuff like that
4337614 we love to do a lot of staying in and watching tv
4337615 today the risk is very small its a warning sign
4337616 could new devices be hackable we have no definitive evidence to suggest one way or the other but we expect the risks to increase as wireless ranges increase
4337617 its important to understand the risks so you can protect against them
4337618 today the chance of a patients implantable cardioverter defibrillator being reprogrammed by a malicious hacker is remote and the safety and benefit of these devices outweigh the current risk of this kind of interference
4337619 we think its important to think about these types of things
4337620 we dont want to leave ourselves and our patients vulnerable
4337621 the national enquirer being able to get into someones health details thats the greatest risk at this moment than hackers going around causing physical harm to people
4337622 essentially you couldnt go on a fishing expedition for this kind of information
4337623 the beatles and clapton and buddy guy thats mostly what i like to listen to
4337624 when i was quinns age i didnt know what a guitar was
4337625 when i discovered the guitar i couldnt afford one so i used to put two nails in the wall with two rubber bands trying to come up with a guitar sound so its great quinns started so young
4337626 the first time i brought him onstage i was knocked out by his playing
4337627 he kept looking up at me like he was saying show me something i dont already know
4337628 quinn gave buddy his guitar to sign and buddy asked you wanna play a couple riffs on that
4337629 so he played something and buddy was just blown away
4337630 i make a fraction of what i did in the private sector
4337631 no one who knows the people in this campaign would infer that money is the motivator
4337632 it looks like the proponent of this income tax referendum is doing nothing more than trying to fill up their pockets as opposed to backing a question they really believe in
4337633 i believe in second and third chances and any number of chances so long as the individual impresses me that he or she is willing to take advantage of it to make something of his or her life

4337648 we might see you again and we might not if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake
4337649 dear dad this is dylan we are still alive we are ok and we know what happened to mom mark and slade and im sorry you had to loose sic a son and an exwife and im sorry we had to be taken away from you and i miss you
4337650 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4337651 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4337652 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4337653 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4337654 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4337655 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4337656 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4337657 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4337658 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4337659 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4337660 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4337661 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
4337662 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
4337663 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
4337664 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
4337665 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
4337666 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
4337667 in a way this whole study can be summed up by asking how many trees does a wolf represent
4337668 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved
4337669 stable isotopes ecological integration and environmental change wolves record atmospheric carbon isotope trend better than tree rings

4337676 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4337677 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation

4337718 gun registration better background checks additional licensing procedures for concealed weapons
4337719 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4337720 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4337721 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4337722 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4337723 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4337724 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

4337732 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government

4337734 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4337735 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4337736 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

4337742 if the hospital has questions they call me at home or if a sick person has a problem they call
4337743 sometimes they dont wash their hands or they eat too much or dont eat enough or they get a cold and it makes them more sick sometimes it just happens
4337744 theres this toy i wanted to get for the kids the millennium falcon its huge
4337745 whats that the millennium falcon babe han solos ship the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs you know that big circle thing
4337746 oh thats not bad i thought you were going to say like 500
4337747 a n impression is being created that there are two heads of the npa or theres co management this manifests itself in members of the npa engaged in core business being called by the dg without me being requested or informed i find this untenable and am not going to allow it to continue any longer
4337748 at the beginning of last year menzi simelane asked me to spy on vusi pikoli and told me that either pikoli or himself will have to go because both of them cant stay
4337749 so much that i wrote a letter already in 2006 to mabandla drawing her attention to the fact that simelane was meddling in my affairs
4337750 yes simelane did request meetings and organised supper and lunch with senior people in the npa where he was less than flattering about me and my ability and where he asked people for information
4337751 i know that simelane spoke at various meeting to staff members of the npa and very senior people within the npa i dont know why it was so personal for him
4337752 a very senior member of my staff told me at the beginning of last year that simelane was telling people that i will not stay in my job for long the its either him or me story ive heard from more than one person
4337753 i discussed the matter with my immediate boss and i agreed to meet simelane thinking that he might want to offer me another position within the justice department at our meeting he started attacking pikoli out of the blue he said thats an arrogant man who doesnt listen or take instruction
4337754 simelane was clearly very upset with the position in the npa of advocate anton ackermann and said that vusi wont act against him and his apartheid era agenda
4337755 i told simelane that we the npa have said publicly that president mbeki and other cabinet ministers are not under investigation for the planting of landmines and that that case is closed but he said he has had discussions with the president about the fact that vusi and his team are planning to prosecute anc leaders
4337756 simelane made it clear to me that he told the president that pikoli and the npa are planning to prosecute him
4337757 he asked me what pikoli does when he goes overseas he asked me what pikolis special adviser kalyani pillays role in the npa is and he said i cant see why you people must prosecute jacob zuma because i myself am not a man who believes in circumstantial evidence
4337758 i felt like he was tapping me for information and that he wanted me to give him information that he can use against pikoli i was very uncomfortable because he was testing my loyalty to pikoli
4337759 i heard about a number of such meetings that simelane held with staff members i asked the minister to intervene on my behalf but as far as i know it didnt happen
4337760 either vusi pikoli goes or i go both of us cant stay here its either him or me
4337761 was not at liberty to discuss who my clients are but i have met with several people to formulate similar strategies with regard to the scorpions hearings
4337762 senzo was asked by a anc youth league member about the anc submissions to the directorate of special operations the scorpions hearings he said that submissions had been discussed at a meeting on friday together with the planning of a petition to support the disbanding of the scorpions which will be signed by people at the election launch rally in umlazi this saturday
4337763 it seems that zumas backers are determined to bring even government officials on board especially in assisting them in terms of what they must submit to the hearings
4337764 the anc had a rally in umlazi on saturday they said a memo must circulate and get signatures against the scorpions at the rally
4337765 it is all part of the programme to ensure that at all gatherings of the anc the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary must be attacked
4337766 well brief you on friday then well tell you exactly whats happening
4337767 we dont know the plans of the government except that they want us to go back to where we used to live the problem with going back is that were scared
4337768 after hearing about the closure we started organising accommodation in town and some say they will go back to alexandra township most of us will end up going back to the townships
4337769 anyway we cant build houses for people who dont have legal status we dont have a policy which allows that to happen
4337770 there is a threat in sending these people to the communities anything can happen
4337771 we did not want this to happen the government was close to agreeing to extend the deadline but cormsa messed things up by going to court civil society is now split
4337772 consolidare la fine delle ostilit e accelerare il ritiro delle forze russe sulle posizioni anteriori al 7 agosto scorso
4337773 sur le papier on est favoris parce quon a remport les trois derniers titres mondiaux mais les jo sont une preuve tr s particuli re
4337774 directed the mms to begin the initial steps for developing a new five year program we are in effect getting a two year jumpstart on that process but it is still a multi step and multi year effort to develop the program
4337775 an advantage for younger gymnasts is that they are lighter and often more fearless when they perform difficult maneuvers said nellie kim a five time olympic gold medalist for the former soviet union who is now the president of the womens technical committee for the swiss based international gymnastics federation
4337776 attribution and modification transparency requirements directly serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform downstream users of the project which is a significant economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce
4337777 just because someone distributes something for free doesnt mean that theyre waiving their copyright remedies
4337778 in the normal case the license says you can use it as long as you pay me money
4337779 this is the first time this situation has come up with respect to an open source license
4337780 i can develop something via open source and i can put it out there and say you can use it but by doing that im not leaving my copyright rights
4337781 een deel van de westerse intelligentsia is ook besmet met deze gevaarlijke ziekte
4337782 zo is het bijvoorbeeld nog steeds de vraag waarom en hoe de amerikanen de afghaanse moedjahedien hebben geholpen
4337783 door na viteit domheid en onbedachtzaamheid werd het westen de vroedvrouw van de gewapende tak van de politieke islam
4337784 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4337785 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4337786 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4337787 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4337788 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4337789 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4337790 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4337791 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4337792 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4337793 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4337794 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4337795 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4337796 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4337797 market conditions continue to be extremely difficult and timberwest is therefore staying the course with its harvest deferral strategy
4337798 ive been running so long but i feel like this is the first time people want to talk to me
4337799 i could have a great race and be 10th but i could also have a great race and win
4337800 so i just want to be in that position when i hear that bell for the last lap i want to have put myself in that position and then i think you need a little luck and the stars to align a little bit to come home with a medal
4337801 its been very exciting to see her blossom not just physically but psychologically and to be a young woman thats very confident of herself now
4337802 obviously its not how we always imagined but now its just ill run to represent the both of us
4337803 im getting goose bumps right now just thinking about it and i try not to think about it too much because i know how hard it is and how literally i have to have a lot of luck for that to happen but that would just be id probably be like done retired what could ever top this
4337804 they had been involved in a relationship for some time prior to her murder
4337805 i think we are talking about things that dont matter
4337806 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multi cultural country in spain
4337807 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4337808 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4337809 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect
4337810 he was adamant that mark will be an absolute hit in the game
4337811 positionally weve obviously got some ideas about him playing in the back three but theres no reason why he couldnt play elsewhere
4337812 weve only just made some contact with toulon i suppose the encouraging part of that is theyve shown great respect for the order of the court
4337813 it shows that an injunction and an order of the supreme court of nsw is significant
4337814 were happy to talk weve said that all along and well start to open up some discussions now
4337815 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4337816 in my opinion her honour did not err as alleged
4337817 her honour did not as the appellant suggested pay mere lip service to the requirement to compare the two offenders by referring to the principle only to ignore it
4337818 rather she made a comprehensive comparative analysis of all relevant circumstances and concluded the offenders were not like in any respect apt to attract the parity principle
4337819 this is one of the worlds deadliest viruses we know a percentage of recovered animals continue to carry the virus but we dont know what proportion that is
4337820 but we certainly know that it happens and there have been reappearances of the virus and that is a real risk
4337821 my horse would not have contracted the virus if the clinic had followed the correct system
4337822 it was put in the same stable three hours after a horse died of the virus
4337823 im asking the dpi for an inquiry to find out who is accountable
4337824 weve only just made some contact with toulon i suppose the encouraging part of that is theyve shown great respect for the order of the court
4337825 it shows that an injunction and an order of the supreme court of nsw is significant

4337827 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4337828 i think we are talking about things that dont matter
4337829 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multi cultural country in spain
4337830 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4337831 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4337832 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect

4337839 im asking the dpi for an inquiry to find out who is accountable
4337840 they had been involved in a relationship for some time prior to her murder
4337841 the third one you start feeling it its not a good feeling
4337842 youre seeing it so you know its happening they hit a lot of home runs and were making it easy on them because were not locating pitches
4337843 this series definitely falls on our offense for not producing much of anything
4337844 but 63 out of 100 pitches for strikes thats over 60 percent strikes i just have to be able to finish hitters
4337845 in a one run situation when we needed to be what he had been recently
4337846 demonstrate that as sons and daughters of ephs we are proud and grateful for our experiences and what we have been given
4337847 and by establishing a community based context for the alumni association we are once again strengthening the bond between alma mater and the people she nourishes
4337848 there is a great deal of affection for east providence high school
4337849 by holding events like this we seek to unite townie alumni and cultivate this affection for a greater good namely the hallowed bond between ephs alumni
4337850 our t shirt promotions have been a popular promotion for us going back multiple years
4337851 it happens that this is a great time to recognize joakim soria for his contributions particularly making the all star team
4337852 we certainly recognize that the nickname mexicutioner is out there
4337853 but from what i understand whb cant and hasnt taken ownership of that nickname
4337854 these will be more of a fashion t shirt than a baseball jersey
4337855 we want you to decide the nickname for royals pitcher joakim soria
4337856 and i needed to get this over with ill get ready to play tuesday in cleveland
4337857 i guess if need be in an emergency ill catch
4337858 i hope it doesnt happen but if need be ill go back there and do what i can do
4337859 they threw at me and i charged the mound things happen in baseball the thing is the white sox are the team i came up with i have a lot of friends over there i dont have anything against them
4337860 i cant play they threw at me and i reacted i wasnt the first one to do that and i wont be the last one
4337861 as far as live catching action its been going on five years for him he looked good receiving and i emphasized it would be in an emergency situation only
4337862 but when i caught the bullpen workout the receiving stuff was fine i didnt have any problem as far as catching pitches
4337863 i didnt do any blocking or throwing drills but as far as the receiving part that went fine
4337864 theres definitely a lack of focus in what david is swinging at
4337865 and i think most of that goes back to how hes feeling
4337866 today we remember the service of a young man born in woonsocket who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of his country
4337867 i put one up but i didnt realize the competition had dwarfed mine
4337868 well try to keep up fortunately i had a big one
4337869 it would have been cause for concern if there was a connection between the two but as it stands there were no principals from tristate listed as principals at h amp m
4337870 so again he just took vacation time and thats how hes being paid right now
4337871 well we tristate cant bid on state contracts as of now so its none of our business we cant control who bids on it
4337872 like to come to an agreement that we would continue to do the work we know we could do it and save the state money and save the university money
4337873 there wasnt any upkeep and it was falling apart the kids all the neighborhood kids and not just her own were angry
4337874 this is the first park where the neighborhood feels ownership adults who used to be kids now bring their kids and pick up the glass and trash along the way
4337875 she had a plan for me and i just didnt know it
4337876 when she told me once i said yeah ok right how can i be the next onna moniz i consider her the sensei
4337877 neighborhood day means a lot because what it does is keeps the people attached to the park
4337878 it has turned into a huge community reunion where everyone has a park story to tell
4337879 demonstrate that as sons and daughters of ephs we are proud and grateful for our experiences and what we have been given
4337880 and by establishing a community based context for the alumni association we are once again strengthening the bond between alma mater and the people she nourishes
4337881 there is a great deal of affection for east providence high school
4337882 by holding events like this we seek to unite townie alumni and cultivate this affection for a greater good namely the hallowed bond between ephs alumni
4337883 i am a woman in love its a riiiiiight i defeeeend over and over agaiiiiiin
4337884 in my opinion her honour did not err as alleged
4337885 her honour did not as the appellant suggested pay mere lip service to the requirement to compare the two offenders by referring to the principle only to ignore it
4337886 rather she made a comprehensive comparative analysis of all relevant circumstances and concluded the offenders were not like in any respect apt to attract the parity principle
4337887 we are fighting the fire internally and externally there are two turntable ladders spraying water down on the building and ten appliances
4337888 our main aim is to stop the fire spreading to the cornmill shopping centre
4337889 the alarm went off at 12 30am at first we thought it was a false alarm as we had a drill last night then we realised it was for real
4337890 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4337891 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4337892 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4337893 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there was people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly
4337894 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
4337895 in the aftermath of that interview while i was advised by the superintendent of schools not to make any public comments and while i had to move out of my own house to avoid news reporters and harassing phone calls the mayor held a press conference and publicly slandered my reputation my integrity and my intelligence
4337896 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4337897 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
4337898 ngapain sih hari jumat disenengin apalagi 3 hari terr la lu

4337922 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
4337923 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
4337924 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
4337925 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
4337926 a reasonable approximation for the response rate on the economist wave of august 4 6 would be 43 the opt out rate from our mailings was 4 my best guess at a comparable statistic to refusal
4337927 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll

4337931 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4337932 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4337933 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx

4337935 its nothing you would want to see nothing that will be seen in my porfolio
4337936 if you have the ability to love love yourself first
4337937 for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
4337938 i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me
4337939 their leaders in prison received better conditions such as the best food as well as more family visits and towels for the shower these people have no morals they have no integrity
4337940 i was very enthusiastic about what i heard i began to read the bible every day and i continued with religion lessons i did it in secret of course i used to travel to the ramallah hills to places like the al tira neighborhood and to sit there quietly with the amazing landscape and read the bible
4337941 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
4337942 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one
4337943 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith
4337944 i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god
4337945 admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
4337946 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
4337947 theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east
4337948 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
4337949 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
4337950 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
4337951 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
4337952 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
4337953 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4337954 notice of plaintiff michael savages decision not to file an amended complaint as to rico cause of action
4337955 it is obvious that mr savage finally came to realize that his bizarre and frivolous smears would not stand up in a court of law it is a pity that he does not show as much common sense while spewing invective daily against religious ethnic and even medical minorities on his hate radio program
4337956 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
4337957 i had a really close look and didnt recognise any buildings that i know from birmingham so i thought theres just something wrong here
4337958 im a regular visitor to the us and i thought maybe it looked a little bit like a us city i thought well actually theres a birmingham in america
4337959 so i got on to google and found a picture of the downtown area of birmingham alabama and hey presto there it was
4337960 we are wise to avoid association with those who hide their identity in internet chat rooms

4337970 they had been involved in a relationship for some time prior to her murder
4337971 in my opinion her honour did not err as alleged
4337972 her honour did not as the appellant suggested pay mere lip service to the requirement to compare the two offenders by referring to the principle only to ignore it
4337973 rather she made a comprehensive comparative analysis of all relevant circumstances and concluded the offenders were not like in any respect apt to attract the parity principle
4337974 now ive made the final and i can put my feet up
4337975 my throw is always better in the evening so im super excited because i know it will only get better
4337976 tonight is shaping up to be big for usa shot put
4337977 that is the only word that i would use outstanding
4337978 with those guys you make one mistake its a home run
4337979 theres a guy on base and its two runs they have a very dangerous club they take big aggressive swings and sometimes that will get you a one for four instead of just putting the ball in play but that one for four well they almost lead the league for a reason
4337980 i couldnt even see the ball at all in my first two at bats
4337981 i was thinking about drag bunting anything to get on base so that i didnt strike out i couldnt even pick the ball up to drag bunt
4337982 i asked him how much he weighed and he said 290 295
4337983 hes played good when we played down there in tennessee those two days of shared practices with the titans last week he really played good
4337984 they have good physical tackles and he blocked the heck out of them
4337985 but its definitely nice to prove that your play is turning some heads
4337986 every day you go out even when i was with the threes and twos in your mind you go ok youve got to think of yourself as a one
4337987 after you think about it youre already focused and youre already prepared so when an injury and such happens youre ready to jump in
4337988 i made the transition my senior year of college at kansas state moved from left guard to center and ive played center ever since i got into the league
4337989 i feel like thats always how its going to be for me ive always got to struggle
4337990 like coach al saunders rams offensive coordinator says its the longest job interview in the world
4337991 that kind of tells you where i am right now but it could change
4337992 im just trying to go out there and show even for next year that i can do it that i can be successful
4337993 i still believe that the more carefully we can maneuver him into something like that the better hell be in our long term future
4337994 in the closer role you have to be able to do certain things he is not able to do certain things yet so all youre doing by anointing him is putting him in a position to fail
4337995 were in the eighth inning and were in a jam and you dont look at the ninth inning then
4337996 you look at how are we going to get out of this jam we felt that he was the best guy to get out of the jam is it possible perez could run with the ninth yeah its possible hes going to be given opportunities
4337997 i think you go carefully and see how hes doing
4337998 if he struggles a little bit you take him off he does well you give him a little more what you dont say is hey hes the guy what hes shown monday and wednesday means well be comfortable giving it to him again hes riding a wave of confidence
4337999 youve got to give a lot of credit to the scouts
4338000 they recognized players who wanted to get signed and get their careers going the early returns on this draft class have been very positive
4338001 im still trying to find out who made the claim on me
4338002 im a firm believer in god that hes got a certain plan for me
4338003 i kind of compare him to spoon a year ago
4338004 im just really surprised he is where he is right now
4338005 were definitely excited about the depth we have at linebacker
4338006 no one will ever ask me where im from and ill say it low
4338007 i dont have the sad story of parents not being there having no one in my corner
4338008 on my progress report it wasnt even my report card i was getting a bad grade in physical science my mother said youre not running anymore until you show me that youre going to get an a in this class
4338009 she actually cracked the whip like i thought she would
4338010 stay positive you can do it go after your dreams and goals dont get distracted
4338011 i cried for like 60 seconds and i said all right i dont have time for this lets go
4338012 youre the underdog theres no pressure so go out there and take it
4338013 when they light that cauldron and they put those five rings up there
4338014 i talked to the mayor yeah he called and i told him i just want for people to know about this and i want them to watch
4338015 that to me would mean so much think how many kids have seen me in east st louis and can say i know her mom and they can say see she made it too you can do it that to me would mean so much
4338016 he was informed that police did indeed board aircraft routinely but it was not clear if this could be done without the consent of the carrier it was confirmed that el al were refusing voluntary access to the plane and det supt macbrayne could not get confirmation that he had a legal right to do so
4338017 dsu macbrayne took the considered opinion that as access to the plane would not be consensual there existed a real threat of an armed confrontation
4338018 it need not have been an armed stand off they could have stopped the plane from taking off and brought in negotiators from the foreign office can you allow people from other countries to put the police in a situation where they cant enforce british law
4338019 a travesty masquerading as righteousness exonerating terror masters from blame but painting those who fight mass murderers as villains
4338020 this matter was of national significance to the jewish community any police action could significantly impact on community confidence in the police
4338021 this case was not a stunt it was an effort to bring almog to justice in a place where he would have a fair trial because he has complete immunity in israel to have it thwarted and then to have an apology is incredible
4338022 its been a great experience for us having the rams here has really exceeded our expectations in terms of things we hoped to accomplish we just hope theyve had a good experience as well
4338023 ive been to obviously some other camps and been off site
4338024 this was by far the best off site that ive been to as far as the facility and the people how they treated us and everything
4338025 you dont make any commitments other than to say wed like to theres no reason we wouldnt but wed have to make some plans as to how we would come back and things we would do different any of those little things and if wed agree to those im sure it would work out
4338026 after we went down to tennessee for four days on grass the guys said they felt good
4338027 their knees felt good their ankles felt good their backs felt good halfway through the first practice back at concordia guys were like my god your ankles hurt your backs tight you dont really notice it till you go onto grass and you actually feel the difference hopefully the next time we come up here we might have a little bit more work on some grass
4338028 because you dont have to deal so much with getting water dehydration muscle pulls and things like that youre able to keep your intensity up in practice
4338029 if youre training for weeks in that kind of heat in the st louis heat i really dont think its too beneficial
4338030 ive been in new york with the jets where you go to hofstra and its kind of a dump
4338031 its almost ocean like its a beautiful school beautiful place
4338032 they kind of threw the wool over our eyes the first night with the lobster tails and the steaks and stuff
4338033 pancakes that are hard runny eggs undercooked bacon i like breakfast but not here

4338035 was it a good war did waging it help anyone who needed help
4338036 noticed that jews made up one third of the freshman class at harvard
4338037 no doubt jews arent a lovable people i dont care about them myself
4338038 owing to our having run short of germans and enemies

4338041 we should find a hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among nations

4338050 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4338051 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4338052 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle

4338114 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4338197 we think this way we used peoples money so we must give it back to people because we serve for people rite no profit mind ever across us
4338198 well i dont know all the words to that song but ill say this were very excited just in the fact that we feel we improved off last weeks performance
4338199 it almost wasnt really a surprise because you see him do it in practice and he came out and had such a command over the offense its a good feeling
4338200 as comfortable as you can feel with two days of practice i think some good things happened though
4338201 he sat there and just smiled and we laughed about it but those things happen
4338202 i think it was a nice start for him well see where it goes
4338203 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4338204 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4338205 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4338206 we have held talks with georgia for 15 years and now we will only talk with them after recognition of our independence
4338207 there have been several drafts and they rejected them all its clear to me that its pointless talking to them
4338208 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear
4338209 its about allowing your neighbors to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4338210 been standing out in the rain been calling out your name got that lonely feeling again calling out your name do you hear me do you want me
4338211 if i could back time if i could find away id take back those words that hurt you youd stay words are like weapons i didnt really mean to hurt you if i could reach for the stars id give them all to you you would love me
4338212 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
4338213 as the embodiment of the emerging kingdom of god on earth
4338214 they want to act out what theyve seen in pornography
4338215 traditionally people who attend worship service at least once a month and on a regular basis have been considered
4338216 la constituci n de la rep blica bolivariana de venezuela otorga al principio democr tico una funci n primordial en la formaci n y funcionamiento de los poderes p blicos
4338217 siendo la participaci n ciudadana un medio eficiente para desarrollar los postulados de una democracia participativa y protag nica postulados stos que constituyen las bases que sustentan la llamada revoluci n democr tica derivada del nuevo orden constitucional
4338218 from the buzz of the spectacular opening ceremony to a memorable first four days of competition the olympics have completely captivated the american public and further ignited our sales efforts
4338219 americans are consuming our olympic coverage in record numbers and in every way through broadcast cable online and mobile whats particularly encouraging to me is the strength in the young male demo which has shown the largest increase of any age group
4338220 theres no question that michael is an extraordinarily important driver
4338221 is michael phelps the greatest american athlete of all time
4338222 michael is recognized as possibly the greatest swimmer in history and its no secret that every guy in the water sees him as the one to beat
4338223 powerbar has long been a part of michaels training regimen so hes a natural fit to bring this power to push campaign to life as he prepares for the 2008 games powerbar will be there to help push him through his grueling training sessions in an effort to help him achieve his goals
4338224 since i started swimming competitively powerbar performance bars have been my go to energy source to gear up for intense workouts and to recharge afterwards
4338225 on average im in the water about five hours a day and burn through about 2 3 000 calories proper nutrition is an essential contributor to my athletic performance and im psyched to have powerbar on my team as a nutritional partner as i prepare for athens
4338226 over the years weve had more than 200 u s olympic hopefuls use powerbar products in training and competition
4338227 elite athletes like michael require an incredible amount of energy for optimal performance and were proud to provide the nutritional tools they need to help them reach their olympic goals
4338228 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
4338229 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
4338230 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
4338231 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
4338232 i saw a guy biking down commonwealth ave with a sleek black specialized bike hot
4338233 the first look s for god the second is for the self and the third is for satan
4338234 omg these guys need to enter their keys right as the day turns
4338235 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
4338236 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
4338237 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
4338238 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
4338239 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4338240 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4338241 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4338242 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4338243 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4338244 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4338245 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous uvb induced priming for skin cancer by practicing good sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4338246 these moisturizing creams might act as an irritant or a promoter of skin cancer in mice skin but extensive study is needed before we advise people that their commonly used moisturizers can cause skin cancer
4338247 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4338248 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4338249 less skilled money managers may gravitate toward running more focused funds
4338250 i dont put more than 5 of a clients assets with any of them
4338251 if one fund is in trouble another is usually doing well
4338252 it doesnt bother me if shareholders leave because we underperformed on the markets upside but id be very unhappy if they left because we performed worse on the way down
4338253 we dont want to be in a position where our investors are redeeming our shares and we dont have the cash to pay them that would force us to sell positions we like at a loss
4338254 people think you are sometimes manic depressive i think im going to have to ask you to leave the company
4338255 customers want access to content from a broad variety of sources how when and where they choose
4338256 i dont know that dell can make a compelling case
4338257 prices of everything are going up but my wages sure arent
4338258 its not heres a check come back in a year
4338259 we have done a lot of work on how social behavior interacts with social technology but we dont really have the tools to take on a project like dr brynjolfssons
4338260 we now have a commitment that we are going to do research together i feel responsible for the success of their project
4338261 we needed to hit control alt delete on our lives and start over
4338262 meet your needs and control your wants so that you have financial freedom and dont become a slave of your work
4338263 the next day i was talking to somebody and i looked over and the sign was gone
4338264 the top rental markets were less impacted by the housing bubble bursting
4338265 the job growth in these markets is probably still good though the rate of job growth is declining
4338266 thats going to continue to happen until you see a decline in the for sale inventory once that happens people renting out these units will end up putting them up for sale and that will lessen the rental inventory
4338267 fewer people are moving out of our apartments to buy homes
4338268 last year in our portfolio about 20 of tenants moved out to purchase a home in the first six months of this year it was 14
4338269 most of the top execs of the manufacturers are over 50 and dont know what their own products do
4338270 so they stopped thinking about how to make phones more cost effective
4338271 he has the power to unite the marketing and technology and business groups unfortunately japanese companies arent structured that way
4338272 i hope the iphones introduction leads to a sense of crisis at japanese handset makers
4338273 they have been coddled in this market the iphone could be the trigger that forces them to make changes
4338274 isaiah has a piece of my heart and he is family
4338275 shes gotta learn how to walk again her arms are broken her legs are broken everythings broken except her spine and her neck
4338276 jessica feels like she could have done something she could have done something different but theres nothing she could have done differently
4338277 jessica told me this is ironic what youre doing to me today what i do to dad every day
4338278 and that was taking care of her in the hospital but jessica has been the one taking care of my father more than all of us
4338279 its going to be a long haul long recovery for jessica
4338280 football was everything to him its his passion his future he was looking forward to playing for the raiders one day
4338281 you know they only parked that way because they can
4338282 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4338283 ultimately al qaeda couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4338284 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4338285 omg who is this creature that the cat dragged in the cats hair looks better
4338286 c vica para o pr ximo dia 19 de agosto com o objetivo de aprofundar a luta
4338287 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4338288 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4338289 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4338290 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4338291 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4338292 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4338293 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4338294 why do the all the world governments say the earth is round
4338295 what about nasa dont they have photos to prove that the earth is round
4338296 why has no one taken a photo of the earth that proves it is flat
4338297 how did nasa create these images with the computer technology available at the time
4338298 how are the world governments organized enough to carry out this conspiracy
4338299 what about the stars sun and moon and other planets are they flat too what are they made of
4338300 why are other celestial bodies round but not the earth
4338301 isnt this version of gravity flawed wouldnt planes helicopters paragliders crash into the earth as the earth rises up to them
4338302 doesnt this mean wed be traveling faster than the speed of light which is impossible
4338303 if the world was really flat what would happen if you jump off the discs edge
4338304 if the earth was indeed a flat disc wouldnt the whole planet crunch up into itself and eventually transform into a ball
4338305 how is it that snakes do not have legs but dogs and cats do
4338306 how come the travel time by air from south america to new zealand via the polar route is shorter than the travel time going north first and then south again
4338307 when traveling in a straight direction you will always reach the same point on the globe from where you started how can this happen if the world is flat
4338308 are most or all fes biblical literalists who feel like their religious belief system would be threatened by a round i e spherical earth or are there any atheists agnostics who are fes as well
4338309 no person can enjoy living in this kind of environment but i have no other place to go
4338310 he needs a lot of care he is hardly able to move he is on his way out
4338311 in an age of sensuality and materialism the assumption points out the dignity and destiny of our human body extols the dignity of womanhood and turns our eyes to the true life beyond the grave at mass today ask mary for the grace to keep your mind fixed on things above and to aspire continually to be united with her and to be brought to the glory of the resurrection
4338312 plans to prosper her not to harm her plans to give her hope and a future
4338313 oh jeeze im no good at math besides its not like i need it
4338314 i make x my expenses are y thus i have x y at the end of the month
4338315 dont worry well take care of it well just secure your mortgages using the assets of all the people who were able to figure out how to buy a home and not put themselves into a hole thanks for playing
4338316 get really fucking big do whatever you want and the government of your country will be here to step if it goes badly
4338317 rick if you recover from this you our certainly going two tell what is real and what is not about health foods and nutrition
4338318 wenige minuten nach den sch ssen in duisburg waren schutzpolizisten am tatort bald darauf unsere ermittler sie haben noch versucht das ein oder andere opfer zu reanimieren
4338319 ich hatte in den letzten jahren oft genug mit der mafia zu tun
4338320 sie haben in den vernehmungen viel erz hlt aber immer nur so viel wie wir ohnehin schon wussten

4338323 theyre trying to whitewash their human rights record and present a pretty picture to the world when in fact behind the facade is an ugly reality and the situation in tibet is as bad as its been in a very long time
4338324 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4338325 aunque todas las posibles preguntas de la ciencia recibiesen respuesta ni siquiera rozar an los verdaderos problemas de nuestra vida
4338326 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4338327 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the west helena neighborhood sits among abandoned homes and occupied residences in disrepair
4338328 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4338329 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4338330 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4338331 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
4338332 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4338333 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
4338334 david could we pick up where we left off in high school

4338336 you mean myron parsons who gave me some grief in high school
4338337 david could you once forget your past cause myron will die if you dont release him from the capsule
4338338 oh like you really did christie when you asked me to pick up where we left off from high school
4338339 what has far greater explanatory value for political contributions is the expectation that congress or the white house will grant the contributor a right or privilege that other americans dont get it might be changes in the tax code that benefit one class of americans at the expense of another business or farm subsidies the favorable location of an airport or restrictions on imports that compete with a corporations product in other words big campaign contributors want a special privilege
4338340 i doubt that ill ever get back to this now on that note lets recap my main points shall we
4338341 theyve lived in such an oppressed society that they dont know any better
4338342 oh the eggs how do i like them sorry scrambled please

4338349 the rest of the staff has been like angels to me
4338350 if they thought i was a cranky old biddy they should just have given me my money and let me go
4338351 i paid in good faith and i wanted my money back thats all its the principle
4338352 ive learned you should focus your anger on the person whos causing it and not to lash out
4338353 besides i may meet a better class of people in jail
4338354 thats the real crazy thing i just wanted my money
4338355 team members were concerned about her well being and her safety and wanted to make sure she wasnt endangering herself
4338356 i want the staff trained in how to treat customers
4338357 i wouldnt go back to that store if everything in it was free
4338358 if theyre waiting to see me again theyre waiting for a cold day in hell

4338381 lo mejor est siempre por llegar y el mejor etoo est tambi n por llegar hay que mirar al futuro siempre el pasado ya es historia y no vale para nada recordarlo
4338382 ya no vale la pena recordarlo todo ha quedado olvidado lo m s importante es vivir el futuro
4338383 no creo que me haya reconciliado con el p blico porque necesitaba hacerlo estoy inmensamente agradecido al p blico del camp nou siempre ha estado a mi lado y se lo debo todo llevo cuatro a os aqu y ya me conocen lo suficiente
4338384 yo nunca me he visto fuera del barcelona porque siempre he sido jugador del bar a tengo dos a os m s de contrato nunca me v fuera del barcelona siempre fui jugador del barcelona nada cambi durante estos dos meses

4338388 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4338389 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4338390 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4338391 i have now put some people to work to find these bastards
4338392 we regret that we got any part of our story wrong and extend our sympathies to victims of the violence and to the u s soldiers caught in its midst
4338393 extravagantly assumed the power to dictate new rights not expressly stated in the constitution and in so doing foisted its philosophical vision on the united states with consequences far beyond the courts imagining
4338394 i am hopeful that with the debacles of the twentieth century we can recover the original intentions of the framers of the constitution
4338395 its not the evidence that matters but the severity of the charge
4338396 if you read the al qaeda training manual they are trained to make allegations against the infidels
4338397 ive tried to compromise and they want all or nothing and i cant do that
4338398 we both agreed that after several months of discussions we have been unable to come to a negotiated position where the presidents nominees get an up or down vote
4338399 our taxes were decided in a situation where the borders were closed now they are open
4338400 its impossible to have this high tax today because people can go buy their alcohol in germany or denmark and sometimes they turn around and sell it here illegally
4338401 we want alcohol to be sold with age controls and with social controls not in dark parking lots from the backs of trucks
4338402 liberals saw the savagery of the 9 11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers
4338403 saw the savagery of 9 11 and the attacks and prepared for war
4338404 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4338405 in recent years chinas booming economy fueled by large inflows of foreign direct investment fdi and rapid export growth has emerged as a significant force in the global economy
4338406 when i write i can shake off all my cares
4338407 at the age of 14 and with so little experience you cant write about philosophy so onward and upward with renewed spirits itll all work out because im determined to write yours anne m frank
4338408 it is right here in southeastern connecticut where the heart and should of americas submarine force lives
4338409 otis is the number one base for homeland defense on the entire east coast it simply makes no sense to close otis in the post 9 11 world
4338410 it is a travesty and a strategic blunder of epic proportions on the part of the defense department
4338411 it is entirely beyond me as to the basis on which they made their recommendations but it certainly wasnt logic or reason clearly in arriving at these inexplicable decisions the defense department and the navy must have been operating in a fog so thick they couldnt even see the facts in front of them
4338412 the state indiana stronghold of the ku klux klan has a horrible history
4338413 if we build this pile of rubbish the terrorists will have won
4338414 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4338415 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4338416 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
4338417 im just asking them to sit and watch because youre going to eat your words
4338418 the suspects brought the victim to the hinterlands of salvador and sapad leaving the tamaraw fx they used as getaway vehicle in barangay village mamaanun in sapad
4338419 look at how many times our swimmers have been tested i assure you that this is a clean team
4338420 why do they accuse us every time we are doing well why dont they look at those times when we are not good
4338421 this isnt over yet we expect more harassment and bombing
4338422 im not worried about state owned companies like some people are
4338423 many of the major corporations in south korea that already have investments in australia are state owned
4338424 over many years weve had many countries invest in australia that are essentially state owned
4338425 but also theres a number of other factors relating to the mining the strength of the company which is the worlds largest and clearly a very solid foundation
4338426 we have the federal government in south australia saying oh we made short term decisions without long term knowledge in terms of water resources and now were going to have to rectify that
4338427 this is a great program though which our young professionals and would be professionals could be trained on their potential future permanent jobs in australia this would be another competitive advantage of them over job aspirants from other countries who had not undergone such training
4338428 however our mission in australia has not yet maximized the program which many countries have been benefiting from for a long time already
4338429 these major developments in other countries should serve as a wake up call on our government to work aggressively to tap the work and holiday visa program and maximize its benefits for our young countrymen such great opportunity for our people should not be left untapped just because our officials have been sleeping on their job

4338435 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4338436 weve heard the reports and we continue to monitor it
4338437 there are all sorts of rumors but the general sense is that yes he is resigning
4338438 we say his trial if it all is the prerogative of parliament to decide

4338441 was nicht vermeidbar ist kann aber ganz unterschiedlich interpretiert werden
4338442 hoffen wir mal dass er eine ehrliche antwort erh lt
4338443 die hersteller wissen oft selbst nicht was die ausgangsstoffe ihrer produkte sind
4338444 es ist extrem teuer und langwierig das hinterher analytisch festzustellen
4338445 es ist nicht wichtig wer in dieser situation pr sident ist
4338446 es sind zuvor nicht alle diplomatischen m glichkeiten ausgesch pft worden und niemand in georgien glaubt im ernst dass man einen krieg gegen russland gewinnen kann
4338447 ich werde den pr sidenten nicht aus paris kritisieren jetzt ist nicht die zeit und dies ist nicht der ort jetzt m ssen wir alles tun um georgiens wirtschaftliche und politische unabh ngigkeit zu verteidigen
4338448 wie wahnsinnig muss man sein einen krieg gegen russland zu beginnen

4338450 es geht nicht darum ob ich f r saakaschwili bin er ist jetzt mein pr sident und es geht um das schicksal unseres heimatland
4338451 aber nat rlich war es ein fehler die milit rische l sung zu suchen jetzt haben wir so viele opfer zu beklagen das war es nicht wert
4338452 europa will eben auch im winter in warmen stuben sitzen
4338453 europa und amerika werden niemals f r demokratie und freiheit k mpfen das haben wir jetzt gesehen sie haben ja schon bei unseren wahlen beide augen fest geschlossen
4338454 saakaschwili wird keine ernsthaften probleme bekommen solange es keine alternativen zu ihm gibt n mlich politiker von format
4338455 wir haben es seit der revolution nicht geschafft die formel f r einen demokratischen staat zu verwirklichen und diese formel hei t balance durch gewaltenteilung

4338457 no evidence suggests that ache is insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency to justify the appointment of a receiver to take control of the entire corporation and all of its assets
4338458 the county has merely shown that ache might lose one of its funding sources
4338459 the opinion says the ruling by pat sebesta is improper and they are back in charge at ache
4338460 it will be a lot of work but i am looking forward to putting ache back together and being here for another 38 years
4338461 the county has shown only that while one of the board members was on a brief sick leave the board had eight rather than the required nine members
4338462 this showing does not support brazoria countys contention that the board was therefore illegally constituted in general
4338463 this is for the patients and the people of brazoria county who need medical care
4338464 im not the slightest bit concerned with respect to handling ache
4338465 learning is collaborative we cannot just sit inside our classrooms and teach the way we always have the world is connected now and we must be connected too
4338466 its kinda crazy because im going to be one of the first guamanians to tour around with someone big like that but its cool hopefully hes a real chill person

4338468 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly

4338470 our study is the first demonstration showing that dietary intervention can help to control iop and increase ocular blood flow in asymptomatic subjects and if taken in time may prevent an evolution to higher pressure and symptomatic glaucoma
4338471 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4338472 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4338473 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4338474 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4338475 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4338476 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4338477 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4338478 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage
4338479 in our business world when a lot of people talk about monitoring theyre actually doing a reactive call center
4338480 but things are moving in real time the idea of sending data to a marketing and ad network is a lot more stringent its a need to be there type of situation we decided that the only way we could become what would be considered a fully monitored network was to find world class networking software

4338483 if you put the two together you have a good combination of managing and monitoring virtualized environments
4338484 in a lot of our networks theyre giving affidavits to their companies and theyre expecting us to hand them those reports so they can turn it into an advertising affidavit
4338485 we dont feel like weve been put into some box
4338486 we feel like theyre highly interested in us and believe they will be there to work with us i think thats important for companies that are small to medium sized and growing
4338487 to get bigger we need a software provider thats willing to roll up their shirtsleeves and work with us
4338488 but nimsoft can be a little more nimble in embracing new technologies with ibm hp and bmc it can take a little bit longer to get it out of the labs theres more bureaucracy to deal with
4338489 youre not sure what the end game is going to be
4338490 is it going to go public in a couple years will someone buy them and then youre looking at a migration

4338503 we began with one ap course in 2002 2003 and have expanded to ten course offerings for 2008 2009
4338504 our graduates are fully prepared for success in college they can compete on an even playing field with students from much larger districts because of the programs available to them at wakulla high school
4338505 we have added more and more advanced placement courses and college dual enrollment opportunities over the years to give our students every advantage
4338506 it makes me sad that i cant use our national flag in the stadium
4338507 this way is better its the right thing to do
4338508 they try to be good hosts and try to treat us like family but i think some people dont feel that way
4338509 the government is determined to keep our fisheries strong as such various policy amendments and subsidies will be used to help fishermen
4338510 as the state agency whose mission is to manage fish and wildlife resources for their long term well being and the benefit of people it is our responsibility to predict what could happen to the resources we have been charged to conserve it is what people expect of us
4338511 our scientists and managers have crunched the numbers for the wildlife 2060 report and assessed what might happen to fish and wildlife if growth continues on its same course
4338512 the development of 7 million acres represents a substantial loss of habitat and exceeds the size of vermont
4338513 continuing the current trend clearly would be detrimental to wildlife but it also would be detrimental to people fishing hunting bird watching all kinds of outdoor activities which brought many of us to florida in the first place would be greatly diminished this affects our quality of life and our economy
4338514 natural habitats could become islands in a sea of development
4338515 corridors for some animals to move about the state will be cut off by roads subdivisions and shopping malls
4338516 on the contrary i have confidence that floridians will band together to ensure that we do the right thing for our fish and wildlife while boosting our economic growth and quality of life
4338517 but we must bring the best out in people to reach solutions and we must bring virtually all interests to the table to make that happen
4338518 get involved in land use planning and decision making and become good stewards of the land
4338519 become educated about what to vote for and encourage your policymakers to support initiatives that help wildlife provide incentives for private land conservation and encourage smart growth i am confident the future for our wildlife is bright
4338520 were certainly trying to send a message to those people that choose to harm police officers that we will not be assaulted this way and that we will provide justice
4338521 cell phones guns and knives have to be left here

4338524 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness because i dont know if im worthy
4338525 i have done some horrible things i ask the lord to please forgive me i gained nothing but just brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people

4338554 tomar una decisi n en segunda votaci n aprobada con un voto favorable de la mayor a absoluta y es lo que ocurri ayer
4338555 veremos de qu se trata la denuncia pero el secretario general ha jugado dentro de los c nones y lo digo con toda la tranquilidad de lo que marca la normativa andina
4338556 lo que pasa es que normalmente uno busca los consensos y ayer la verdad era imposible porque ya vamos busc ndolos desde el mes de enero per se ha ido acomodando inclusive modificando los textos a pedido de bolivia y llev bamos los textos que ya se hab an aprobado de manera informal y dec an no no puedo votar
4338557 la posici n era imponer a otros tres pa ses miembros una decisi n particular sobre tres pa ses soberanos que est n en posici n de buscar una soluci n
4338558 cualquier cambio que se haga porque no obedece a los intereses particulares de este pa s termina siendo bloqueado
4338559 no plantea flexibilidad para las negociaciones por ejemplo per quiere llevar un tema que considera fundamental que es la defensa de los conocimientos gen ticos y tradicionales de nuestros pueblos y ellos consideran que esa postura no la podemos llevar
4338560 they moved the final two pieces of the house which are now laying next to the bottom floor they had to do a lot of reframing and other work due to rot and damage to the original house and theres still a few more things to do before they can lift the last two pieces on top

4338562 what i found out after i took the pastoral action with governor sebelius is that senator obama had her on his advisory committee for catholics

4338585 those who are against this recommendation have argued mainly from the premise that it would have an adverse impact on freedom of speech and investigative journalism however these arguments quickly move on to the potential consequences for the continued publication of celebrity tittle tattle and paparazzi photos
4338586 look all im saying is if these big stars didnt want people going through their garbage and saying theyre gay then they shouldnt have tried to express themselves creatively
4338587 the focus of the commission was more on the private sphere than the mainstream media and related to the protection of ordinary citizens rather than celebrities

4338592 the next generation srx is the result of the continued exploration and refining of cadillac design language with the goal of creating dramatic presence in the luxury crossover space
4338593 it sort of takes the work we do on a weekly basis with the girls and sends a very confusing signal to them
4338594 we talk about media images the differences the reality and how media can create images that arent necessarily realistic
4338595 we try to give them internal strength to respond to those mixed messages and images
4338596 actually what was being portrayed in the opening ceremony swap is an unfortunate thing that happens more than we want to admit in our society
4338597 certainly the words attractive or pretty can do a job on kids self esteem and can make them feel less adequate and really does send a poor message
4338598 we want every woman out there to realize they have potential and we want to portray those women in our advertising
4338599 clearly theres an interest in opening that conversation and finding a way to help girls deal with media images and the confusion ms garfinkel said
4338600 everyone wants to look back on their life as a life well lived

4338638 the city council would have to change the ordinance for us to be able to benefit from this
4338639 even if we were to change the ordinance it would have zero impact
4338640 the city ordinance has to be changed before we can collectively bargain it
4338641 the gas electric and phone companies simply pass the costs of details on to their customers
4338642 we as a city council should absolutely look at this
4338643 there should be no sacred cows that get in the way of deciding how best to use taxpayer money

4338910 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4338911 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4338912 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4338913 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4338914 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4338915 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4338916 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4338917 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4338918 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4338919 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4338920 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4338921 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4338922 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4338923 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4338924 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4338925 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4338926 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4338927 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4338928 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4338929 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4338930 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4338931 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4338932 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4338933 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4338934 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4338935 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4338936 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4338937 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4338938 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4338939 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4338940 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4338941 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4338942 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4338943 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4338944 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4338945 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4338946 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4338947 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4338948 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4338949 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4338950 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4338951 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4338952 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4338953 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4338954 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4338955 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4338956 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4338957 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4338958 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4338959 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4338960 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4338961 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4338962 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4338963 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4338964 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4338965 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4338966 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4338967 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4338968 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4338969 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4338970 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4338971 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4338972 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4338973 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4338974 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4338975 perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry but by demonstrating that all peoples cry laugh eat worry and die it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other we may even become friends
4338976 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4338977 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4338978 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4338979 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4338980 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4338981 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4338982 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4338983 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4338984 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4338985 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4338986 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4338987 who are open to doing something on the production side
4338988 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4338989 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4338990 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4338991 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4338992 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4338993 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4338994 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4338995 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4338996 property prices have more than doubled since march one house is going for 90 000 a threefold increase
4338997 the uk is getting close to what we set out to achieve
4338998 there is a view the militia is going to come back its not going to happen we are not going to see parts of basra going back to militia control
4338999 in the long term iran wants a stable democracy in iraq a stable neighbour with a shia majority in the short term it is totally legitimate that there is iranian influence in southern iraq culturally and religious
4339000 the assassinations are back especially in the last two weeks just like before
4339001 two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone the militiamen and some of the commanders of the mahdi army are still there they dont carry weapons in public but they are still there a few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the mahdi army officials who controlled the port now the iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now there is no work apart from collecting garbage it doesnt matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate and you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper
4339002 the mahdi army doesnt exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed though less than before the militiamen are wearing government uniforms
4339003 the army raids remind us of what the baathists and saddams mukhabarat secret police used to do we thought that after saddam we would be living in a new iraq but the same system is back for example now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia theyve started replacing headteachers with their own men
4339004 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets there are so many of them they cant arrest them if they did theyd have to arrest half of basra if you are a state employee then life is good but if you dont have a fixed salary then things are very hard

4339006 no it is our custom during mating season when indian men see a cave they holler wooooo wooooo wooooo into the opening if they get an answer back it means theres a beautiful squaw in there waiting for us
4339007 sure and begorrah look at the size of this cave its even bigger than those the indians found there must be a really big fine woman in this cave

4339012 the air force on monday suspended all efforts related to development of a program to become the dominant service in cyberspace
4339013 if and when that happens then we will address it
4339014 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4339015 whatever moves they plan on making itll be whats best for the team
4339016 hes just a hard tenacious hitter hes a big guy and he brings it every time he makes a tackle so hes a tempo setter
4339017 i hate to lose him you hate to lose anybody
4339018 but when youve done it for as long as weve all done it it happens every year so somebody else has just got to step in and take his place
4339019 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4339020 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4339021 we have to get cueto out of that first inning with a lower pitch count
4339022 and their lineup rolls around quicker and you face the big boys again in the second or third instead of the fourth
4339023 if he has as 1 2 3 first inning who knows how deep he might go into a game
4339024 im just glad he got the win because he has been pitching great
4339025 this guy is a competitor he competes he wants it
4339026 it is refreshing to see him on the mound and he is controlling his emotions a little better and im excited for him and us and his future
4339027 thats what young people are supposed to do and he brought some speed the way he covers ground and runs the bases
4339028 it was so exciting i just dont know what to say i felt really comfortable and worked out all the jitters
4339029 we have a little verbal confirmation and at the time berry didnt know if i understood what he said
4339030 i got the sign from the git go and i was geared up because i know keppinger is a good bunter as soon as he made the call i knew wed get an automatic run
4339031 i got good pitches to hit and thats all you can ask for
4339032 i was able to put a pretty good swing on things
4339033 youd like to fast forward the clock two years but were fortunate to be here in the process
4339034 we were not looking to trade tifu he wanted to be traded
4339035 we are however very pleased with what we got in return
4339036 i have all the respect in the world for yannick and i hate to see him go but if he doesnt want to play here he doesnt want to play here and my job is to take care of the dayton bombers
4339037 im looking for young players with energy and character and i think we got that in these guys
4339038 we were aware of what tifu was capable of and we were aware of his interest
4339039 we also know theres a big risk associated with the trade no question about it because were giving up some quality players and tifu could be called up at any time
4339040 but were not a team to hold anyone back so were willing to take the risk and hope that hes here long enough to contribute to our team
4339041 matt is under the care of a team of top cardio pulmonary and infection specialists here in hong kong who have diagnosed matt with severe pneumonia and believe he is making gradual progress
4339042 we have been so moved by the concern shown for matts safety and well being both in china and australia
4339043 your combined efforts ensured that the severity of matts condition was identified early and that he received and is racing appropriate treatment
4339044 we all talk to people who talk to people and there are people close to the obama campaign in the course of conversations who made clear to me that there was very high level discussions the obama people expect powell to endorse him
4339045 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4339046 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4339047 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4339048 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4339049 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
4339050 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
4339051 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
4339052 for me the decision was quite an easy one in the end because the warning signs were there for me early michael said
4339053 i was getting to friday afternoon and i felt pretty sore and tired from the previous week i was waking up on saturday and hoping id be right for the weekends game
4339054 i think once you start doing that youve got to have a serious look at your future

4339074 the aircraft is an active contributor to the actual apprehension of these criminals
4339075 its hard to imagine combat today without uavs the aircrafts capabilities are continuously improving and they are beginning to do a lot of the same missions as our manned aircraft
4339076 our guys fly them out hand them off to the brigade combat teams in theatre and at that time the specific brigade tuav elements actually fly the missions
4339077 at the conclusion of a shadow mission the brigades route the aircraft back into our airspace and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
4339078 everything we do in terms of maintaining the aircraft is annotated by inputting information into our computer system we keep track of just about anything you can think from actual flight hours to required services and inspections
4339079 the uavs can provide at least 70 percent of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
4339080 the operators can observe perform route reconnaissance and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial reconnaissance methods its very helpful
4339081 the shadow provides coverage for a lot of raids we do road scans for roadside bombs and have actually caught terrorists in the act of implanting these bombs in the road the uav mission is imperative to todays combat operations
4339082 when the infantry troops are going into a certain area to clear buildings well go in ahead of time and scan the area and well be able to report to them exact grids of potential enemies in the area

4339138 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4339139 were retired and you can see it in the grocery stores
4339140 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent

4339142 if this administration were competing in the bad economic policy olympics theyd receive four gold medals today
4339143 it will take some time for the economy to turn around
4339144 obamanomics is lavish government spending that must be paid for by new tax increases on a struggling economy
4339145 its every part of the housing market thats getting whacked right now
4339146 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4339147 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4339148 haces tu trabajo y jam s piensas que un d a estar s en el hall es un a adido m s a las otras cosas que he conseguido pero esto es algo muy diferente es algo honorable y muy especial
4339149 they saw something black and white it was a panda
4339150 the obvious thing that comes to mind was the hgh thing in the morning that was a really tough day for me
4339151 the other thing was the tough loss with the red sox celebrating on the field we had a 3 1 lead in the series going into the locker room and having grown men crying
4339152 im excited to be going to a team with a lot of pressure the alternative is going to a team where the games dont count im excited i love the pressure i want to pitch in a world series ive never pitched in a world series
4339153 i started praying i wanted to stay in the game

4339159 i was looking for that pitch and i got it
4339160 ive been working with hitting coach brian daubach in the cages and i feel comfortable now nice and balanced and have been working hard at it
4339161 we deny claims in the recent suits and will vigorously defend against any and all allegations
4339162 in the meantime management continues to remain focused on executing its business strategy
4339163 in each fiscal year we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial part of our sales and revenue
4339164 we had a 1 3 billion order backlog of which 769 million was attributable to three customers without naming those customers there is a risk that existing customers will elect not to do business with us in the future
4339165 in light of the critical importance of ldk solar as a customer of gt solar gt solar had to have had constant communications with ldk regarding sales to ldk of dss furnaces and other products
4339166 based upon those communications if ldk was preparing to enter into or had entered into a contract to purchase dss furnaces from jyt corporation and to publicly disclose that contract on july 25 2008 then gt solar would have known those facts
4339167 delays in shipments which threatened gt solars relationship with its most important customer
4339168 belatedly revealed that new orders from ldk had materially slowed or stopped
4339169 they just said if i needed some closure to talk to the pitching coordinator former met pitcher jon matlack i called him up and he said it was a numbers thing he just said they needed to make room and had to let me go
4339170 i threw 90 91 the rest of that game and i started the ncaa regionals in miami against st bonaventure and i kept saying im going to throw to prove that im healthy but it was down to 86 88 terrible timing
4339171 they figured with my size and how hard i was throwing theyd give me a shot to rehab after surgery
4339172 i mean i did pretty well i was an all star a month ago if they dont think you can pitch in the big leagues right now theyre going to give other guys a shot
4339173 obviously he was a florida state league all star this year
4339174 if you look at his career numbers 25 10 3
4339175 obviously the other night he wasnt lucky but in his first start he kept the ball down
4339176 that first start i had a little bit better command of the strike zone
4339177 the umpire had a down strike zone and i was hitting those spots well the other night the home plate ump wasnt giving me the down strike and i had to adjust a little bit left a couple of balls up that i shouldnt have left up id like to think if there was a little bit bigger zone things would have turned out different
4339178 my theory is i need to have a good month and hopefully get invited somewhere for spring training
4339179 theres always room for improvement i just need to be more consistent from start to start for the whole year work with my pitches work on my two seamer a little more and define my splitty split finger fastball as my out pitch get more swings and misses on that
4339180 you just have to go out and do the best you can
4339181 dont put any extra pressure on yourself things can only get better
4339182 aunt jess dont you think the jonas brothers are the cutest boys ever
4339183 i am really excited to get the chance to race in koni challenge in a german car with mark white and apr motorsport i have spent a lot of time with the apr motorsport team as well as mark over the years including spending some time this past spring on the nordschleife in a gti race car we all developed a great amount of respect and friendship for one another and i hope to do a good job for team as filling randy pobst s seat is not easy

4339200 when people understand the world of opportunity they can find through computers and the internet they are inspired to learn 21st century technology skills
4339201 many of the communities we visit are initially hesitant to embrace information technology but we remove this barrier by tailoring our programs to meet local economic health and educational needs and ensuring our approach aligns with the indigenous cultures in which we work
4339202 thanks to vasconcelos support and the increased access to technology in our community we are making education in our schools more effective and meaningful for our children
4339203 vasconcelos is transforming peoples lives by bringing information knowledge and hope to communities
4339204 its work is providing new opportunities for people young and old to improve the quality of their lives and ensure a better future for their families i hope vasconcelos example will encourage more organizations and governments to provide greater access to information and technology for those most in need

4339209 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009

4339215 these matches will help us progress in the end we may have lost now but these defeats will make us stronger

4339224 if youre calling regarding the recycling contract i voted against changing from waste management to eureka when the issue comes to the council on august 26 i will vote against the contract
4339225 back to sorting your recyclables more time and effort for the resident for a program that costs more
4339226 to contemplate 400 000 over three years just because this company in st paul says it is more responsible more green its just too much
4339227 result in a higher quality material being sent to market
4339228 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so

4339231 having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage sic
4339232 there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
4339233 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat
4339234 and that process takes 10 or 12 years from the time a breeder starts to make crosses to the time a new variety comes out and so were about halfway through that process
4339235 last year in august the total tax collection in the state was rs 650 crores rs 6 5 billion and by the 13th of this month itself the tough stand taken by the taxes department has seen tax collection touch rs 649 crores rs 6 49 billion

4339241 i cant wait to sit on one of those seats in the new arena
4339242 for a responsible canadian foreign policy and solidarity with the oppressed
4339243 i felt really relaxed out there kept the nerves in check and tried not to do anything stupid and just bided my time
4339244 i thought the gap wasnt going to appear and i was just squeezing through i did get bumped and even drew blood on a cut finger
4339245 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
4339246 we will not discuss issues related to sharia law this will not happen
4339247 we dont want these non government pf trusts to get saddled with illiquid stocks non government pf trusts are being allowed to invest in high liquidity shares and so the linkage to derivatives we have now allowed for greater exposure of 15 per cent as against the earlier planned 10 per cent
4339248 street gangs pose a growing public safety threat to communities throughout minnesota
4339249 its made an impact and its helping us gather additional information on the gangs and the gang members and as long as theyre locked up theyre not shooting anyone
4339250 imagine your government got together and decided that you werent cute
4339251 it is better to know less than to know too much that isnt so
4339252 to search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good italian restaurant
4339253 if we claim something there will be data to back it up
4339254 chosen as the avenue by which it is assumed contact is likely to occur meanwhile there are people all over the world psychics shamans mystics schizophrenics whose heads are filled with information but it has been ruled a priori irrelevant incoherent or mad only that which is validated through consensus via certain sanctioned instrumentalities will be accepted as a signal
4339255 you want me to find a thousand fasteners and washers

4339259 thats stupid ok gotta go sell a case of magic bullets right now
4339260 naw i think i can make five points on the deal
4339261 this case cries out for the statutory maximum term of imprisonment as well as a substantial fine because of the seriousness of defendant snipes crimes and because of the singular opportunity this case presents to deter tax crime nationwide
4339262 sentences appear to be harsher and more severe for racial minorities than others as a result of this law the current penalty structure results in a perception of unfairness and inconsistency
4339263 hey do you mind if we spread some human and industrial waste on your yard to see how bad it screws you up
4339264 it will be a strange feeling after all this time i came to cumbria with the intention of staying two years but then fell in love with the place it is hard to think of a place that rivals it for its landscape and moods
4339265 ive covered most of the major news stories during my time with border tv and they tend to stay in the memory when i got to lockerbie for instance it was another 24 hours before i got home
4339266 it was an unbelievable experience one of the first things i came across was a car park with a large hole in it
4339267 i looked down and there was a jumbo jet engine at the bottom of it
4339268 then i remember driving up to tundergarth and there was the cockpit in the middle of a field quite unreal
4339269 when the floods hit carlisle i got a call from the newsdesk at 4 30am i went down to the sands at first and it was already like a river i moved on to denton holme and got the shot of the ambulance under water which proved to be the iconic image of the floods
4339270 but i get just as much satisfaction out of doing a feature ive been to hundreds of homes in the county and met so many interesting people with fascinating tales to tell i treat every job the same
4339271 that was climbing up the severn bridge then climbing down the cables before the road was put up
4339272 jean and myself have a motor home and well be getting away in that whenever possible we never make plans we just head wherever the sun might be shining
4339273 we have been to every corner of england scotland wales and ireland now i think well be spending more time abroad
4339274 tallene viser at regeringen har v ret alt for bl jet i forhold til at hente udenlandske studerende til danmark og de indikerer desv rre ogs at en ny lem for illegal indvandring er bnet
4339275 med s mange frafaldne fra tredjeverdenslande er det desv rre meget muligt at de bliver her illegalt
4339276 der er nok arbejde for dem at f s rligt med reng ring arbejdsgiverne er fuldst ndigt ligeglade med om de er her ulovligt
4339277 a day without 20 catnaps is a day without sunshine
4339278 nella fede risplende il volto di maria e la bont di dio
4339279 so bene che il primo servizio che posso rendere alla chiesa e allumanit quello della preghiera chi crede non perde mai la speranza
4339280 im all in favour of the practice building up to date premises but not on clarks field
4339281 it is a valuable green space which is heavily used by sports people youngsters and dog walkers it would be ridiculous to think of building there when there is a much better site just a few hundred yards away
4339282 the belah school site has much better access and would be the ideal location for a new surgery in that part of the city
4339283 our priority is to find somewhere convenient for our patients with good access
4339284 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross
4339285 the early indications are that cumbrias a level performance is going from strength to strength
4339286 id like to send my congratulations to all the students and schools who have worked so hard in achieving their goals were starting a new era of secondary education in cumbria with the academies programme and im confident that the new generation of schools were creating will lift performance even further
4339287 a level students in this county have shown a sustained improvement over the last five years and this reflects the hard work put in by pupils parents teaching staff and our school improvement team
4339288 this programme is of lifelong benefit both to the participants and to their employers
4339289 rotary is keen to support the development of harmonious communities and this exchange will provide a special opportunity to help achieve this
4339290 if these charges come into effect they will knock our business for six well do everything possible to stop them being introduced and our members have pledged their support
4339291 curves is a worldwide franchise and one pre requisite of being awarded one is finding premises with free car parking we did that and signed a 10 year lease
4339292 we now find that the council is planning to start charging for spaces around here which is bound to put our members off coming here ive worked out it could cost them 30 per cent more each month
4339293 at the moment they come three times each week for 29 a month if they are having to pay 80p or 1 for parking each time they come then that is really going to mount up
4339294 the whole point of our gym is to provide a fitness and exercise regime at affordable prices
4339295 that is something the government and councils should be encouraging
4339296 there are only a handful of spaces in corporation road and they will be taken up by residents the one hours free parking that exists now is perfect for our members the circuits they do take up half an hour
4339297 a proposal to introduce pay and display parking in three car parking areas two at the back end of corporation road and one on lowther street has been approved by the carlisle local committee following a request from the city council
4339298 at the moment these parking areas are disc zones where waiting is limited to one hour most people would rather park for more than an hour and therefore these parking areas are relatively underused compared with the pay and display system used at the civic centre
4339299 when introducing a pay and display system it will also be covered by cctv which will make the car parks safer and cut down on antisocial behaviour which has been a problem for these areas
4339300 we are very proud of that i think the people who work here and there are 460 of them feel like they are part of a family
4339301 we might be a small centre but we actually deliver to 155 000 addresses in the ca postcode area pick up from 1 268 boxes and have 234 delivery vehicles
4339302 i think we do a great job but we could do better if people printed addresses on envelopes used postcodes and put stamps in the right place
4339303 there have been a lot of changes and more are coming but i would still recommend the job
4339304 i dont think this has been fun at all for him i think if he went back to green bay he would be in a familiar environment and would have been comfortable
4339305 even if he went to minnesota he would be inspired by his vindictive nature to go back and prove something against green bay going to new york was a void filler
4339306 any doubt in your mind at this level can be very detrimental not only to your game but also to your health i think this is a disaster for brett favre i know he wants to play but i dont think in his heart hes really where he wanted to be and therefore i dont think its going to be one of those situations that can be positive they open with miami then they get new england then get san diego and then they get arizona at home the first month of the season will tell us a lot about how brett feels his arm is sore his legs are sore its going to be a limited offense i just dont see it as a positive for him
4339307 when youre trying to recover affordability levels from 24 year lows youre going to need quite some period of time of sustained improvement to make it easier for first time buyers
4339308 im all in favour of the practice building up to date premises but not on clarks field
4339309 it is a valuable green space which is heavily used by sports people youngsters and dog walkers it would be ridiculous to think of building there when there is a much better site just a few hundred yards away
4339310 the belah school site has much better access and would be the ideal location for a new surgery in that part of the city
4339311 there are two possibilities one is to simply knock down the old school and built it on that piece of land the other is to build it on open land there and then to knock the school down to replace the green space i would much prefer to see a medical centre on that site rather then housing and i think its a way for the county council to give something back to the community
4339312 our priority is to find somewhere convenient for our patients with good access
4339313 discussions are taking place between ourselves potential developers and other interested parties but there are commercial sensitivities and no site has been earmarked
4339314 its going to be our main surgery but the other two practices are going to use it as a branch surgery for their patients in this area the other two practices will retain their main premises and use the proposed building as branch surgeries
4339315 a plant label acknowledging the contribution made by people in carlisle is given to local community orchards when the trees are planted
4339316 this was an idea from one of the ripple team who said how great it would be if people in the rural malawian villages felt a connection to the communities in the uk which had helped them so much by providing the fruit trees
4339317 we want carlisle residents to carry on recycling even more aluminium cans and foil their efforts have already exceeded our expectations
4339318 the city has one of the uks best recycling rates and the scheme which runs until next june provides another reason to recycle even more
4339319 street gangs pose a growing public safety threat to communities throughout minnesota
4339320 its made an impact and its helping us gather additional information on the gangs and the gang members and as long as theyre locked up theyre not shooting anyone
4339321 for years civil rights and consumer protection groups have been arguing that the modern subprime mortgage lending system is fundamentally flawed that countless numbers of irresponsible and abusive loans were being made and that the consequences for both borrowers and our economy at large would be drastic
4339322 it has long been clear to our groups that america has a separate and unequal lending system and that african american latino and other minority consumers disproportionately secure credit from an unscrupulous and unregulated lending market
4339323 you are jewish we are jewish you are not christian

4339332 i think youll find that this is the real deal
4339333 we have located a family of bigfoot and besides the clear photo and video we have something even more shocking a body please bear with us at this time we have hired legal help history is in the making
4339334 they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4339335 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4339336 i think that quite clearly qantas themselves regret any disruption that occurs but it is important also to put this in perspective
4339337 australia has a second to none safety system and it is certainly in australias national interest for qantas to not be talked down
4339338 there is always hope only because its the one thing that no one has figured out how to kill yet

4339342 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
4339343 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
4339344 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
4339345 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
4339346 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
4339347 in a way this whole study can be summed up by asking how many trees does a wolf represent
4339348 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved
4339349 stable isotopes ecological integration and environmental change wolves record atmospheric carbon isotope trend better than tree rings

4339379 just the fact that a 9 year old girl could be so selfless she penned this letter to us and made fliers to hang around her neighborhood we were so moved by it

4339399 as we were walking in the dog park we saw a huge mastiff assume an aggressive position so we stopped walking and stood about 40 feet away
4339400 shirley was hitting it with a stick i got out a leash and was whopping it in the face trying to get the dog out of its mouth
4339401 finally he did and there she dropped she was so mangled
4339402 as the people were trying to intervene in the dog attack its pretty lucky that someone wasnt bitten
4339403 we impounded the dog then but released it back to its owner under the provisions that whenever the dog was outside of his residence that it had to be muzzled and on a leash
4339404 it wasnt even with its owner his owner was down the path a different direction
4339405 she was so timid that when they came out of their house she freaked and ran away again
4339406 i used to think all dogs were wonderful sahara did too

4339412 something real to hold onto in a state all broken out with man
4339413 she controls what happens along that river we havent diked it dammed it ditched it or bermed it so what you see in many parts of the river is how it has been for many many years that to me is what makes the suwannee such an incredible natural resource
4339414 theyre just amazed that we have all this nature still available
4339415 where theyre coming from their lakes and rivers are so developed that they have no place to go all you see is houses and backyards they come here and theyre just amazed that they can come 10 or 15 miles down the river and not see a house
4339416 mirage florida and the vanishing water of the eastern u s
4339417 i do wonder if stephen foster helped bring the suwannee some of its luck by writing that song and giving floridians a sense that this is our river
4339418 this region simply doesnt have the political power of a central florida or a south florida and water supply always comes down to power

4339435 prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the united states from any foreign kingdom place or country
4339436 you have to come up with an energy policy that will be long term and remove us from dependency on foreign oil to do that you need to explore
4339437 it seems like were bringing a lot of foreign oil and if it gives us an opportunity to drill off our shores as other countries already are doing and lower our fuel prices to help us out that would be a good thing at this point in time
4339438 they should be able to drill where ever to get the oil we need
4339439 you can drill closer and get a chance of getting more oil for us and lower the price of the fuel and crude oil

4339443 there is no act of court or congress that can make these relationships the same as the coupling between a man and a woman
4339444 there is no natural method by which two males or two females can create offspring in which both partners contribute genetically
4339445 that many individuals suffer from sex role dysfunctions does not change the fact that only heterosexual mating can result in families where a father and a mother collaborate in rearing children that share a genetic contribution from both parents

4339449 its the athleticism and the footwork and the balance that i got from dancing i think that will help me in football
4339450 football is more of a power game dancing is a lot more core work its all finesse and agility foot eye coordination and balance its eight nine hours a day of doing aerobics basically
4339451 you see a lot of athletes whether its kristi yamaguchi or brazilian race car driver h lio castroneves do well on the show because i think that competitive mindset helps drive them to be good at dancing
4339452 youre still pushing yourself in your mind learning to dance is more about your mind than it is your body you have to teach yourself to dance
4339453 youre athletic enough to move but you have to get over the mental hurdles of figuring out what youre doing and pushing yourself through it
4339454 yes theyre going to judge you but its made for tv so theyre going to say what they want to say i mean im not supposed to be a good dancer so what they say is not going to hurt my feelings
4339455 people would say oh she used to dance on ice
4339456 but she had to work as hard as we did maybe it came more naturally for her but she deserved to win the first day we knew she was the best dancer out there we were just trying to catch up
4339457 there are a lot of people who wouldnt have recognized me before if it werent for that show especially women and of all ages too
4339458 there are a lot of motivations for playing this game
4339459 some people do it for money or fame which are all great but the reason i play is to win
4339460 clear signs that the economy is responding to the less accommodative monetary policy stance
4339461 partly as a result of the reweighting and rebasing effects
4339462 in my opinion her honour did not err as alleged
4339463 her honour did not as the appellant suggested pay mere lip service to the requirement to compare the two offenders by referring to the principle only to ignore it
4339464 rather she made a comprehensive comparative analysis of all relevant circumstances and concluded the offenders were not like in any respect apt to attract the parity principle
4339465 they had been involved in a relationship for some time prior to her murder
4339466 mr bracks finds that the industry needs to continue embracing global competition but also acknowledges the challenges it faces not least climate change
4339467 a range of new technology is being developed to meet demands for low emissions pure efficient vehicles and no one can say which technologies will succeed
4339468 in particular some smaller firms supplying automotive components will need to achieve larger economies of scale and become more export oriented in a highly competitive market
4339469 the review has come at an urgent time for the australian automotive industry
4339470 now is the time to commit to changes in the way we handle automotive policy so that we can create a more successful and sustainable industry
4339471 central to this needs to be a vision to produce one million cars here by 2020 mainly for export and to secure reciprocal obligations that deliver genuine opportunities for local sourcing
4339472 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks
4339473 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs
4339474 china india malaysia are not doing it and neither are canada and the european union
4339475 we are pleased to see that hes picked up part of our submission and that is to double the green fund from 500 million to one billion dollars
4339476 we see that as a critical part of the future of the industry and its important that we act sooner rather than later to position our industry not only domestically but to make us internationally competitive as well
4339477 we acknowledge that there will be significant restructuring in the auto components sector we want to ensure that any worker will have their entitlements 100 per cent guaranteed
4339478 the whole process of this report has been a positive process
4339479 this is one of the worlds deadliest viruses we know a percentage of recovered animals continue to carry the virus but we dont know what proportion that is
4339480 but we certainly know that it happens and there have been reappearances of the virus and that is a real risk
4339481 my horse would not have contracted the virus if the clinic had followed the correct system
4339482 it was put in the same stable three hours after a horse died of the virus
4339483 im asking the dpi for an inquiry to find out who is accountable
4339484 theres no doubt that the police investigating the police is not a satisfactory way forward
4339485 im not worried about state owned companies like some people are
4339486 many of the major corporations in south korea that already have investments in australia are state owned
4339487 over many years weve had many countries invest in australia that are essentially state owned
4339488 but also theres a number of other factors relating to the mining the strength of the company which is the worlds largest and clearly a very solid foundation
4339489 we have the federal government in south australia saying oh we made short term decisions without long term knowledge in terms of water resources and now were going to have to rectify that

4339493 im actually supporting and calling for much greater accountability and transparency and performance indicators that tell us how often these kind of things are happening
4339494 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same

4339497 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
4339498 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible

4339509 ddi makes it easy for faculty and students to experiment with technologies they may not have used through that experimentation they can find out what is most useful for enhancing education both in and outside of the classroom
4339510 with all of the new emerging technologies appearing at an unprecedented rate and being used by our students before they come to our university ddi is a way of finding out the most effective uses of these technologies to enhance learning instruction and the life of our students on campus
4339511 weve done that with portable media devices such as the ipod they are now a part of what we do and were doing the same thing with other technologies as we explore them
4339512 allowed us to do things in our class that we wanted to do but werent able to do on our own
4339513 the lake elmo landfill has been a complete and total failure from the beginning
4339514 i think its morally reprehensible that our generation is not paying its own way with respect to pollution

4339733 what they did is they brought in a second spreader so they can work on both ends of the city at the same time
4339734 one thing people should know is sunday morning bright and early 8 a m theyre going to be tearing up mount bernard avenue
4339735 there is mass sunday morning at holy redeemer on mount bernard
4339736 weve notified the church as well but not everybody will know this before sunday but if mount bernards barred maybe they can use the school board access for the buses most people use that to get to church anyway the entrance to the church parking lot will be disrupted during the day
4339737 the games will be over by then the idea is to get it torn up and put back as quickly
4339738 that equipment is smaller equipment its not meant to pave roads
4339739 its meant to cut water lines and patch it so we dont have to wait a month for a contractor
4339740 its pretty amazing that she would book a trip to do what is a very intensive hike
4339741 the mayor her work schedule wouldnt allow her to come
4339742 i got a call and it was probably about a quarter to 12
4339743 me and the town manager maxine hayden took the opportunity to come and to welcome him to deer lake and to give him the invitation to come back again
4339744 if his wife enjoyed her trip so much as she told us she enjoyed her trip i say theyll be back again
4339745 the guy who was guiding her on her hike invited her back to his house for a home cooked meal with his family
4339746 she did the four day hike of the western gorge and that its a hard hike
4339747 she said that her husband probably wouldnt be able to do what she did
4339748 like i said its just totally different from what theyre probably used to
4339749 in gros morne national park i mean theres peace and quiet and nothing and nobody around you
4339750 i dont know what about the description of this movie would make you want to come out and see this
4339751 are you kidding theres no way they are going to sucker me into this
4339752 ok the same scene but you are not thinking about your own life you are thinking about buying a hybrid car
4339753 this is looking like one of these things where the last part is that he woke up
4339754 its stupid i didnt think they were allowed to do that
4339755 what kind of policy do they have you think he would take it back to the vehicle and throw a card in the mail box to have you come and pick it up i called the manager and he said they dont have a policy like that and they can drop it off anywhere they want to you dont have sign for it or anything
4339756 if thats not their policy the driver shouldnt be working there he should be fired or something
4339757 if it was a money making venture they newfoundnv wouldnt be changing their business model
4339758 no doubt there are challenges with charter flights its a very expensive proposition and it needs to be sustainable in order to make it sustainable there has to be in conjunction with flights a significant marketing campaign to ensure the flights are meeting the yields required to make them self sufficient
4339759 whoever derives a benefit from the international tourism market should be playing a role in the marketing effort
4339760 the charter flight was subsidized by humber valley resort so you can see the business decision there if they were losing money
4339761 overall there needs to be more marketing in europe the provincial government has focused a lot on ontario and quebec in the last number of years trying to draw in expatriate newfoundlanders and people who have never been here before but there is a niche market in western newfoundland with the european market and we need to spend some money and market this area of the province
4339762 when youre trying to recover affordability levels from 24 year lows youre going to need quite some period of time of sustained improvement to make it easier for first time buyers
4339763 while we believe that potential accc issues can be resolved they may come at a price to bg and possibly to qgc if bg has to exit its 20 per cent stake in qgcs tenements credit suisse said in a client note
4339764 all this spells delay or an adverse finding by the accc with bg forced to go back to the accc with its solution which we do not believe is the best outcome for bg
4339765 provide treatmeant to ill relatives who are a genetic match
4339766 well now i have to buy all of my supplies there
4339767 were going to offer this much if you dont like the offer stop us now before we waste our time
4339768 i guess they won their super bowl rings in training camp because they didnt win it last year
4339769 play the role of the underdog as well as anyone
4339770 when i went into it the choice i was trying to make was what team could i make
4339771 i felt dallas gave me the best opportunity i loved denver denver was right there at the end
4339772 that is something i would like to accomplish i understand a lot of things have to come together for me to accomplish that goal so if it comes to pass its going to be great
4339773 early on i understood that my life and the cards i was dealt wasnt all aces and spades
4339774 so i had to deal with what i was dealt with and the obstacles that came and overcome those things for a person like myself to get in college coming from poverty and from a neighborhood where guys dont even understand what college is i feel like i was ahead of the curve
4339775 selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity
4339776 anytime you get a scholarship and are averaging about 5 5 to 6 yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here
4339777 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better
4339778 i want to play football for as long as i possibly can im excited to be in the huddle again
4339779 it was day to day stuff going back to the spring i tried to be oblivious to last year i wanted to see what he could do
4339780 its a lot of fun to be in this offense and the amount of stuff we can do the different formations and moving people around it really gives us a lot of options
4339781 in explaining it to stephen i said youve got two guys behind you who want your job
4339782 and if we struggle at times during the season we may go in that direction its your job today and youve just got to keep holding onto it
4339783 nothing is just set in stone other than the fact that he is the starter in the first ballgame
4339784 i just have to go out there have fun and be me
4339785 i think i am ready to lead the team when called upon that doesnt change my mindset at all im just trying to be the best quarterback i can be every day
4339786 we know were a talented group but you can be the most talented group and not play hard and not be as good as the other groups
4339787 we just have to play hard and if we do that well be one of the best defensive lines out there
4339788 theres a new challenge every single day whether its an x and o challenge or a personnel challenge or a relationship challenge with the players
4339789 youve got to be able to come up with an answer and youve got to be able to do it fast
4339790 when you change the culture you have to change peoples behaviors
4339791 everybody in this building administrators everybody weve told about changing the culture
4339792 it can get easy to get comfortable losing and easy to say its not my fault
4339793 when i look at it and see the team starting to come together and starting to form a personality and maybe the personality its taking on is a little bit of the head coach i start to say hey we really are doing this
4339794 i think you either live up to it or youll be shipped out thats kind of the way its going to be
4339795 the aussie is really struggling to breathe at the moment it appears mr botros said
4339796 the us dollar has been rallying one more day of this and weve confirmed a fortnights worth of us dollar strength across the board mr botros said
4339797 there does seem to be an unwinding of carry trades mr botros said

4339799 csr advises shareholders to beware of any unsolicited offer they may receive it said
4339800 csr recommends that if shareholders receive an unsolicited offer for their shares they should read the documentation carefully and seek independent financial advice before making any decisions
4339801 i came here to play defense but after all the moving around offense to defense defense to offense i wasnt happy at all and i thought about leaving for a little bit
4339802 i sat down and talked it over with my parents and coach
4339803 coach joe paterno was very honest with me he said look you could be an nfl player as a nose guard but i think you could be a 10 year guy at center i took his word i trusted him
4339804 i knew it was a place i could help the team i knew it was a place where i could get on the field more i knew it was a place i could start im glad i listened i actually love offense about 10 times more than defense now
4339805 shipley wasnt happy about it at the time he was a natural nose guard i think its worked out and i think hes happy with it
4339806 it was a good move for the team because shipley has become a real strong leader hes a bright kid good worker and we needed some leadership on offense
4339807 this is one of the meanest offensive lines ive seen here and it all starts with a q
4339808 were feeling good were very excited for the season to get under way we think we can do some big things this year
4339809 you only go as far as the offensive line takes you
4339810 c mo hace el perro c mo hace el gato
4339811 nicta has a strategy to push into the ict life sciences area and biomedical engineering where it wants to develop a core competency in ict for life sciences and active implantables
4339812 nicta is an ideal environment to carry out these sorts of projects as it provides the scale and critical mass that is required to develop truly breakthrough technologies
4339813 there are a couple of nicta projects looking at feasibility around the bionic eye but our view is that the science is not quite there yet to contribute an ict level design for such a device yet
4339814 dont do that i want to see your beautiful eyes
4339815 so i am just going to say it will you go out with me
4339816 we suffer from hopeless romanticism well be taking donations and hey why dont we set up one of those walks for a cure
4339817 this is a death blow to government and education access
4339818 the biggest thing for me is for people to have a voice this is one of the biggest tools nonprofits have and as the recession gets worse nonprofits need to reach out to the community for what they need
4339819 i have shows where we have saved peoples lives we do a show of whats called erasing the stigma of mental illness
4339820 this is the only forum available to ordinary mortals to provide ideas to the community
4339821 partisan ethics complaints such as this one that are based on nothing more than wild hearsay and unsupported accusations and designed to do nothing more than grab cheap headlines and damage the reputations of public officials
4339822 wanted to get ahead with a fastball and expand the zone with my off speed stuff
4339823 if i dont know a pitcher im not going to swing at the first pitch in the first couple at bats so i can see what hes going to throw me sometimes that does set him up for later in game
4339824 its frustrating for a pitcher whos trying to paint the corners and a guy is not swinging and hes getting ball one ball two ball three
4339825 so the pitcher says im going to throw this first one for a strike and boom home run you have a better chance of doing that if youre patient
4339826 if you take your walks and swing at strikes then you have your base
4339827 if you fish if you swing at the pitchers pitch then you really dont have a plan and youre up there swinging at anything
4339828 we must resist the tendency to regard right to freedom of speech as self subsistent or absolute a line must therefore be drawn between the right to freedom of speech and sedition w hen does free political criticism end and sedition begin in my view the right to free speech ceases at the point where it comes within the mischief of section 3 of the sedition act

4339835 the boys and girls club of fond du lac is a very important part of the community and it normally serves more 400 young people a day and has over 1 100 registered members
4339836 the alliant energy foundation wants help the group get back on its feet as quickly as possible so it can continue to provide critical services to the youth of fond du lac

4339839 hes a very physical player head coach norv turner said
4339840 he is compact and gets under guys pads he got off to a good start
4339841 in high school they said i was undersized to be linebacker and i made all america at college they said i was undersized to be a fullback now they say im undersized to play in the nfl im going to bust my tail harder than anyone else
4339842 i had offers from georgia tech but i couldnt get the sat scores
4339843 i had offers from ole miss and rutgers i had a 3 3 gpa but were talking about some big time academic schools coastal carolina felt like the perfect place for me and im really glad i got to play there
4339844 i got offers from other teams that already had two or three fullbacks
4339845 when i got the call from the chargers it made sense lorenzo neal had just been released andrew had just had knee surgery and they drafted jacob as more of a hybrid guy they really didnt have a pounder im more than willing to come be that for any ball club but i loved the chargers to have a chance to play here and play with lt was too much
4339846 one thing i have noticed is its not too big for him
4339847 a lot of times you get guys running with the first team and its too big for them and they cant handle the pressure but not mike
4339848 hes not trying to piddy paddy you he is trying to hit you and i like that about him
4339849 i had a plan that i was going to work hard and make the team
4339850 ive been fortunate that things have gone well for me and ive gotten a lot of opportunities im not going to let it slip away ill do whatever i can to show my coaches how i can help them win and hopefully my work ethic and my play will speak for itself
4339851 mike hes the kid of guy who likes to show off
4339852 im bitter at the system bitter at the laws change some laws
4339853 we need the fines to be high enough and the penalties large enough so theyll absolutely change their behavior
4339854 they need to stop so other stuff like this doesnt happen

4339882 we make a prosthetic foot that closely matches the function of the human foot and ankle designed to relieve an amputees metabolic stress associated with most other foot prosthetics allowing them to be more efficient and subsequently more energetic

4339887 we say his trial if it all is the prerogative of parliament to decide
4339888 this year we hope to send an indian spacecraft chandrayaan to the moon
4339889 the thing that really confuses me is i thought ron paul was diggs favorite politician what happened to that
4339890 i thought ron paul was diggs favorite politician what happened to that
4339891 the support base for those stories would be so flimsy and homogeneous that a few well aimed buries couldve been enough to knock them down
4339892 if a county is not positioned and has its strategy developed to manage those contingencies its going to be a very difficult year
4339893 meanwhile we have all the usual groups who are going to be pressing us for larger commitments of local funding
4339894 a double or tripling of skilled immigrants would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence stabilize prices
4339895 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4339896 theyve told us that we are the gold standard lets get back to proving it
4339897 frankly we have better and more important things to do we havent been able to pay enough attention to running the schools as much as we would like
4339898 theyve told us that we are the gold standard lets get back to proving it
4339899 we were the explicit model for the creation of this reorganization structure
4339900 what we have now is not perfect but its the best that we know how to do
4339901 local control has been preserved thats been the priority all along yeah there are wishes and wants from one town or another shall we say but i support this plan
4339902 i dont think anybody should come away with the position that we think that we have the perfect operating model we have consistently improved and consistently looked for ways to save money and do things more efficiently and effectively i hope that we are developing a structure here that allows for these locally centered and locally structured improvements
4339903 it will be one book with nine separate chapters one of the most important things we were interested in preserving was local control and from now on the state is only going to recognize one entity so nancy is going have a harder job
4339904 well respect the aspirations of the nepali people for peace
4339905 and well work for the preparation of a new constitution and for the forward looking transformation of the society
4339906 well try to bring other political parties on board as well
4339907 so what youre doing is giving up access rights in one location to get them in another location
4339908 and the maintain and gain policy says that were going to have no net loss and preferably a net gain of public shoreline
4339909 due to the very small area affected by the proposed boat dock facility and ramp and due to the amount of unencumbered shoreline remaining on the adjacent properties approval of this proposal would have a minimum impact on the wildlife and other environmental considerations
4339910 fronts a shallow shoreline and is essentially a mud flat during a large portion of the year this situation renders the shore inaccessible to the back lying property except at the summer pool elevation area b is steep and inaccessible
