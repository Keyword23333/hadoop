5020188 im really concerned with the new principle that the college is promulgating and that is that doctors do not have the right to be guided in the conduct of the practice by their conscience
5020189 thats a sweeping broad principle to establish and once youve established it the field is wide open for further changes
5020190 there are a lot of doctors who feel uncomfortable with this and think its detrimental to the childs welfare down the road the way were reading this draft document is a doctor could be hit with a misconduct
5020191 physicians should be aware that decisions to restrict medical services offered or to end physician patient relationships that are based on moral or religious belief may contravene the code and or constitute professional misconduct
5020192 tell patients about their right to see another physician with whom they can discuss their situation and ensure they have sufficient information to exercise that right if patients or potential patients cannot readily make their own arrangements to see another doctor physicians must ensure arrangements are made without delay for another doctor to take over the case
5020193 this would put a burden on physicians like myself to conform to a view that basically puts my conscience under somebodys elses power
5020194 and the key aspect is moral integrity and the right of physicians to act in a way that does not harm the patient
5020195 if this was just a matter of cautioning members of the college that there may be some problems in exercising their conscience that would be fair
5020196 they seem to go from that into a discussion about professional misconduct and then setting out guidelines about what is misconduct and that becomes very problematic to us because i dont think you can make a sweeping declaration that a doctor or any professional has to ignore matters of conscience in the conduct of their affairs i dont think this has been thought through
5020197 justifying space exploration because we get non stick frying pans is like justifying music because it is good exercise for the violinists right arm
5020198 there are however exceptions to this reliance on feelings as evidence of truth if for instance your feelings lead to disbelief instead of belief theyre apt to be dismissed as some form of denial
5020199 the position i have always adopted is that much of animal nature is indeed altruistic cooperative and even attended by benevolent subjective emotions but that this follows from rather than contradicts selfishness at the genetic level
5020200 the habit of religion is oppressive an easy way out of thought

5020230 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him

5020348 i find it strange that an acclaimed investigative reporter who claims to present the whole truth to his viewers would skip that premise on the day that he gets arrested the man could have killed someone is that not newsworthy
5020349 it is almost like the pot calling the kettle black
5020350 the viewers are supposed to believe that he is honest filled with integrity and worthy of the viewers trust but he was a potential killer that night and his own station acted as if it never happened in my opinion jeff burnside should be reprimanded suspended and forced to attend a 12 step program and then do a feature on alcoholism and driving under the influence before he is allowed back on the air
5020351 mixing alcohol with driving is always a stupid idea latest reporter to make this mistake is miami nbc6s jeff burnside over in miami beach early sunday morning after a police officer noticed the headlights to his jaguar were turned off

5020410 it was the right call at the right time and there were several opportunities
5020411 much of u s medical care particularly the everyday business of preventing and treating routine illnesses is inferior in quality wastefully dispensed and inequitably financed
5020412 the time has come for radical change the management of medical care is too important to leave to doctors who are after all not managers to begin with
5020413 those who talked about health care planning in the 1970s now talk about health care marketing
5020414 the organizational culture of medicine used to be dominated by the ideals of professionalism and voluntarism which softened the underlying acquisitive activity
5020415 the restraints exercised by those ideals now grow weaker the health center of one era is the profit center of the next
5020416 we have heard that but were not sure how to handle it
5020417 developing a licensure process for leaders of health care organizations licensing doctors and health professionals has been going on for a long time but now leaders of health care organizations from hospitals to drug companies have as much if not more influence over health care and hence the health and safety of patients as do doctors yet
5020418 there are no requirements that leaders of health care organizations have any particular educational background knowledge commitment to health care values or for that matter that they have not committed crimes given the scope of bad leadership discussed on health care renewal maybe a licensing process for health care executives would at least ensure that they have not served time in the brig for theft
5020419 as the pendulum swings back from lay leader to clinician leader there is a strong and appropriate opportunity for physicians to reinsert themselves into a leadership role
5020420 in fact the time has perhaps never been more appropriate than today in a health care system that is complex troubled and challenging the physician ceo brings a unique set of skills to the business of medicine the successful physician leader however must understand the business of medicine as well as or better than he or she understands the practice of medicine training developing and equipping our future physician leaders with the necessary skill sets will be one of medicines many challenges as it expands into the 21st century

5020428 the channel simply used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
5020429 pravda ru journalists concluded that the footage of destruction fires and crying civilians used by sky news in its gori report was identical to the footage aired by russian tv channel zvezda star when it reported about tskhinvali
5020430 on wednesday sky news made a report about russian tanks supposedly advancing towards georgias gori the information was subsequently rebutted the company aired the footage which showed that the small town had been destroyed
5020431 georgian authorities and western media outlets previously said that the russian aviation had bombed gori which led to numerous casualties russia strongly rejected those statements
5020432 the footage aired by the british tv channel was preceded with a picture of a road sign displaying the name of the town gori written in georgian and english languages the report also said that a sky news correspondent was reporting from the georgian town
5020433 however the footage that followed the picture of the road sign was fake
5020434 russia s tv channel zvezda which has five camera crews working in tskhinvali aired the same footage two days before on monday sky news showed its report with no sound whereas the people showed in the russian report could be heard speaking russian and ossetian languages the crying people shown in the report were heard cursing georgian president saakashvili for destructions and manslaughter

5020443 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5020444 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5020445 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5020446 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5020447 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5020448 we lost some key leaders but they did well in showing the younger players how to lead
5020449 that they passed it on has been quite a blessing for us
5020450 they demonstrated the work ethic it takes in order for us to play at a higher level
5020451 that these guys learned that speaks volume about their character
5020452 we worked hard during the off season and it shows
5020453 were not quite as big but i think were stronger and more athletic than we were last year
5020454 we run a true double wing so we need a couple strong durable running backs but were also able to spread things out and throw the ball around
5020455 he knows what ive been through so we communicate really well
5020456 i really want to cut down on my turnovers and hes helped me tremendously
5020457 we count on our front eight to shut everything down
5020458 our safeties and cornerbacks run anything down that gets through
5020459 i think its going to be an awful lot of fun
5020460 i have to admit i get a little nervous when i look at our schedule
5020461 in most seasons we have at least one game we could pretty much count as a win i dont know if we can say that this year
5020462 thats our senior night so its going to be another battle of dublin in our last regular season game
5020463 they have more experience in cross town games but were all very excited about it
5020464 i used to teach there and live right behind the field so i have a lot of ties there
5020465 they have a new coach and new turf on the field so were really looking forward to it
5020466 our offensive line has to be tougher and more focused
5020467 the second thing is we have to come together as a team we need to be committed to each other
5020468 tudo me l cito mas nem tudo me conv m
5020469 i have a really bad mouf and a bad attitude you might notice but it will change later
5020470 many of the worlds necessary interventions in the decade before the invasion of iraq in places like haiti and the balkans would seem impossible in todays climate
5020471 from the al ahram weekly online august 7 13 issue which began
5020472 our country has been undergoing the longest slowest economic transition in eastern europe
5020473 we have seen nothing of the grants and loans the west has given us the new transition laws have brought popular misery and raised the cost of living for many my company which has existed for 100 years has now ceased to exist but nobody cares
5020474 found his way into the valley and in time gained great influence at the rajas court
5020475 sikander was a gloomy ferocious bigot and his zeal in destroying temples and idols was so intense that he is remembered as the idol breaker he freely used the sword to propagate islam and succeeded in forcing the bulk of the population to conform outwardly to the muslim religion most of the brahmins refused to apostatise and many of them paid with their lives the penalty for their steadfastness many others were exiled and only a few conformed
5020476 he adopted the policy of universal toleration recalled the exiled brahmins repealed the jizya or poll tax on hindus and even permitted new temples to be built he abstained from eating flesh prohibited the slaughter of kine and was justly venerated as a saint he encouraged literature painting and music and caused many translations to be made of works composed in sanskrit arabic and other languages
5020477 constructed canals and built many mosques he was just and tolerant
5020478 some fugitive chiefs of the two local factions of the makri and the chakk invited mirza haidar dughlat a relation of babar to invade kashmir the country was conquered and the mirza held it nominally in name of humayan till 1551 when he was killed in a skirmish the line was restored for a few years until in 1559 a chakk leader ghazi shah usurped the throne and in the possession of his descendants it remained for nearly thirty years
5020479 if heaven exists it is here it is here it is here
5020480 the kashmiris remained secure in their inaccessible valley but they were given up to internal weakness and discord their political importance was gone
5020481 the delhi throne is beautiful indeed but does it compare with the mountains of kandahar
5020482 a period of storm and anarchy in which assassination was the rule
5020483 created by the military and administrative genius of one man it crumbled into powder when the spirit which gave it life was withdrawn and the inheritance of the khalsa passed into the hands of the english
5020484 often unscrupulous and cruel was a man of considerable ability and efficiency
5020485 found his small kingdom a troublesome charge but after ten years of constant struggles he and his two brothers became masters of most of the country between kashmir and the punjab
5020486 we have agreed that we have no ill feelings because of the past war the two kings will henceforth remain friends forever the relationship between maharajah gulab singh of kashmir and the lama guru of lhasa dalai lama is now established the maharajah sahib with god kunchok as his witness promises to recognise ancient boundaries which should be looked after by each side without resorting to warfare when the descendants of the early kings who fled from laddakh to tibet now return they will not be stopped by shri maharajah trade between laddakh and tibet will continue as usual tibetan government traders coming into laddakh will receive free transport and accommodations as before and the laddakhi envoy will in turn receive the same facilities in lhasa the laddakhis take an oath before god kunchok that they will not intrigue or create new troubles in tibetan territory we have agreed with god as witness that shri maharajah sahib and the lama guru of lhasa will live together as members of the same household
5020487 the king of laddakh reserves to himself the village of minsar in ngarees khor sum that he may be independent there and he sets aside its revenue for the purpose of meeting the expense involved in keeping up the sacrificial lights at kangree kailas and the holy lakes of mansarovar and rakas tal
5020488 to take a leading part in arranging conditions of peace
5020489 set forth that the british government having demanded in addition to a certain assignment of territory a payment of a crore and a half of rupees and the sikh government being unable to pay the whole
5020490 should cede as equivalent to one crore the hill country belonging to the punjab between the beas and the indus including kashmir and the hazara
5020491 on the other hand the ceded tracts comprised the whole of the hereditary possessions of gulab singh who being eager to obtain an indefeasible title to them came forward and offered to pay the war indemnity on condition that he was made the independent ruler of jammu amp kashmir a separate treaty embodying this arrangement was thus concluded between the british and gulab singh at amritsar on 16 march 1846
5020492 one horse twelve shawl goats of approved breed and three pairs of kashmir shawls this arrangement was later altered the annual presentation made by the kashmir state was confined to two kashmir shawls and three romals handkerchiefs
5020493 put gulab singh as maharaja in possession of all the hill country between the indus and the ravi including kashmir jammu laddakh and gilgit but excluding lahoul kulu and some areas including chamba which for strategic purposes it was considered advisable by the british to retain and for which a remission of rs 25 lakhs was made from the crore demanded leaving rs 75 lakhs as the final amount to be paid by gulab singh
5020494 would become extinct in a short time if it were not kept alive by the esprit de corps of the sikh regiments

5020496 the dards were located by ptolemy with surprising accuracy on the west of the upper indus beyond the headwaters of the swat river greek soastus and north of the gandarae i e kandahar who occupied peshawar and the country north of it this region was traversed by two chinese pilgrims fa hsien coming from the north about ad 400 and hsuan tsiang ascending from swat in ad 629 and both left records of their journeys
5020497 was desolated by successive invasions of neighbouring rulers and in the 20 or 30 years ending with 1842 there had been five dynastic revolutions the sikhs entered gilgit about 1842 and kept a garrison there
5020498 the gilgit claims were transferred with it and a boundary commission was sent
5020499 returned to gilgit and took yasin twice but did not hold it they also in 1866 invaded darel one of the most secluded dard states to the south of the gilgit basin but withdrew again
5020500 in 1889 in order to guard against the advance of russia the british government acting as the suzerain power of kashmir established the gilgit agency
5020501 it comprised the gilgit wazarat the state of hunza and nagar the punial jagir the governorships of yasin kuh ghizr and ishkoman and chilas
5020502 all the officers of the british government had opted for service in pakistan
5020503 in the use of mortars rocket grenades ground to air missiles
5020504 mujahideen had been promised two stingers for every soviet aircraft brought down operators who failed to aim correctly were given additional training by 1986 the united states was so deeply involved in the afghan war that soviet aircraft were being brought down under the supervision of american experts
5020505 for the first time in history a senior state department official publicly admitted the possibility of concluding a military alliance between the united states and china
5020506 china is flying large supplies of arms and ammunition to the insurgents in afghanistan according to diplomatic reports supplies have arrived in pakistan from china via the karakoram highway a major build up of chinese involvement is underway in the past few days scores of chinese instructors have arrived at the shola e javed camps
5020507 there were eight training camps near the afghan border operated by the chinese in sinkiang province
5020508 with a variety of weapons including 40 000 rpg 7 and 20 000 rpg ii anti tank rocket launchers
5020509 china did not publicly admit its involvement in the afghan conflict in 1985 the chinese mission at the un distributed a letter denying that china was extending any kind of help to the afghan rebels
5020510 the saudi and gulf rulers became the financial patrons of the afghan rebels from the very start of the conflict
5020511 keen to claim credit for his role in afghanistan by joining the afghanistan jihad sadat could re establish his islamic credentials or so he believed he could thus not only please the muslim nations but also place the usa and israel in his debt
5020512 army camps have been opened for the training of afghan rebels they are being supplied with weapons from egypt
5020513 that for the last twenty one months the usa had been buying arms from egypt for the afghan rebels he said he had been approached by the usa in december 1979 and he had decided to open my stores he further disclosed that these arms were being flown to pakistan from egypt by american aircraft egypt had vast supplies of sam 7 and rpg 7 anti aircraft and anti tank weapons which sadat agreed to supply to afghanistan in exchange for new american arms the soviet weapons being light were ideally suited to guerrilla warfare the mujahideen could easily claim to have captured them from soviet and afghan troops in battle khomeinis iran got embroiled in war against iraq otherwise kabul would also have had to contend with the full might of the islamic revolutionaries
5020514 turns today to the peoples of the east and says to them brothers we summon you to a holy war first of all against british imperialism at this there were cries of jehad jehad and much brandishing of picturesque oriental weapons
5020515 we helped you when you wished to see the soviet union defeated and withdrawing in afghanistan
5020516 now you must help us in our wish to see india defeated and withdrawing in kashmir
5020517 i prefer the personal touch you only get with hired goons
5020518 escuchar el himno en los juegos es m s especial
5020519 era una final y el equipo ha dado lo m ximo
5020520 ojal podamos jugar otro partido contra estados unidos seguro que no ser de sta manera
5020521 lo m s formidable ha sido demostrar que nada es imposible
5020522 le web 2 0 peut il contribu au d veloppement internet
5020523 you know i have not forgotten that last year you insulted me
5020524 i dont think sticking so close to me is the best thing
5020525 all ive found out is that everyone in the world seems to be better looking that me
5020526 none of the girls have fancied me in here so how can i expect any of the women on the outside to like me
5020527 ich wusste dass das rennen heute sehr schwierig werden w rde casey hat stark angefangen er fuhr unglaublich gut ich verlor etwas zeit auf ihn als mich john hopkins anm d red in der ersten kurve berholte ich konnte das tempo von stoner mitgehen und startete die aufholjagd ich wusste dass mein motorrad und meine reifen gut funktionieren w rden ich h tte casey bestimmt auch im zweikampf schlagen k nnen aber leider ist er gest rzt und ich hatte elf sekunden vorsprung ich bin mir sicher es w re spannend zwischen uns geworden
5020528 bis jetzt war es eine sehr schwierige saison aber die situation nderte sich am sachsenring in laguna seca machte ich leider einen fehler aber ich wusste dass es m glich ist hier auf das podium zu fahren im training lief es nicht ganz nach plan und deshalb musste ich dem feld hinterherjagen ich berholte viele piloten und in den letzten sieben runden konnte ich ein gutes tempo gehen
5020529 ich bin absolut gl cklich nach barcelona kamen wir nicht so recht in gang und konnten keine guten rennen fahren drei wochen und der sommerpause bin ich nun wieder fit der platz auf dem podium ist absolut fantastisch nicht nur f r mich sondern auch f r das gesamte team die neue saison beginnt f r mich morgen dann werde ich hier mein neues motorrad testen
5020530 our plan is to deliver a solid multiplayer experience both online and lan
5020531 he has been part of the perth arts community on and off for 25 years
5020532 in terms of the tangible impact he had on a number of peoples careers and the number of people who have started under his tutelage is immense but his support of local writing and local artists has always been strong
5020533 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5020534 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the lanch of the communications satellite omid hope from irans space station
5020535 the second launch of the safir ambassador rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5020536 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5020537 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5020538 i cant believe i actually won nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure
5020539 im so excited i really am i cant wait to get home
5020540 to be silver medalist im really happy it was a challenging time coming to these olympics
5020541 its about time weve been waiting for this so many great athletes have come so close and we were able to pull it off tonight
5020542 itll be alright it was just one of those days
5020543 good non slutty i like you but i dont want you to think i am a whore
5020544 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5020545 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
5020546 it could be argued that excess junk food consumption is effectively normalised at an early age by the sheer volume of advertising pitched at children
5020547 smoking rates in australia dropped markedly when broadcast advertising of tobacco was phased out in the mid 1970s
5020548 no we do not live in a communist country but we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and stability of both fiscal and monetary policy
5020549 when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households and ultimately on businesses and it does put a bit of a handbrake on the economy
5020550 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down that rates set by the banks come down as well
5020551 its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down then borrowing costs should follow
5020552 if those costs were to come down on a sustained basis then there would be no justification for the banks maintaining that margin that they put in there when costs were up
5020553 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion dollars of that to come to account so i think while thats hanging over the markets we are not going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
5020554 weve done what weve done today with virtually no funding except the help of the community
5020555 if all goes well we will open up there in early 2012
5020556 it makes such good sense with the resource center being up there and the annex being up there
5020557 itll be alright it was just one of those days
5020558 ainda h um grande desconhecimento do brasil em rela o china em alguns casos at desinteresse o processo de internacionaliza o ainda recente no brasil e atingiu um n mero muito pequeno de empresas
5020559 se percebe uma mudan a radical nesse incentivo o foco deles agora receber investimentos nos setores de alta tecnologia de pesquisa e desenvolvimento
5020560 as empresas que eles querem atrair para essas zonas hoje s o empresas de alta tecnologia e biotecnologia isso passou a ser uma prioridade nacional
5020561 em alguns setores identificados como de grande mercado na china talvez seja interessante ter investimentos conjuntos esse tipo de parceria pode ser importante at para aumentar a capacidade produtiva e o brasil se tornar um fornecedor estrat gico desse produto para a china
5020562 essas oportunidades existem n o s em com rcio mas em investimentos a gente que precisa se colocar estrategicamente para aproveit las
5020563 a china ainda tem muitas reas a serem expandidas muitas pessoas querem melhorar a qualidade de vida e isso certamente vai abrir muitas oportunidades
5020564 por meio das olimp adas as pessoas certamente ter o uma nova opini o sobre a china ver o que ela n o algo transit rio mas sim um pa s que est crescendo h mais de 20 anos e vai continuar crescendo nos pr ximos 20
5020565 a journal for recording the wondrous uniqueness of every bowel movement
5020566 what should the penalty be for a woman who has an illegal abortion
5020567 terminate the life on an entire unique living human being
5020568 what good is an abortion ban if theres no penalty for the mother
5020569 i think hillary clinton has been very gracious i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
5020570 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
5020571 all of the programs are tied to the fact that you need consumption
5020572 the problem is you are still encouraging a bad behavior the savings becomes the good behavior that becomes an excuse to use the card
5020573 do you want to purchase a home or a new car are you saving for retirement or for education figure out how much it costs then set aside a little bit every month
5020574 uh what she said except uh ah uh incoherent ramblings which continue for 10 minutes uninterrupted by the fawning campbell brown heck insert any msm host there
5020575 my mother was a poor single mother and i grew up without a daddy
5020576 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5020577 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5020578 this ones it this is the one where i will reveal all tell it like it is and just babble
5020579 that these financial difficulties had the potential to linger into the future
5020580 proved to us our core technology it didnt prove we can scale it up to a commercial level thats click on image to enlarge what the next phase is for
5020581 my concern is that they arent recognizing how geographically compact the oil shale resource is there is this idea that theres 800 billion barrels of recoverable resource but about half of that is in the piceance basin
5020582 this is sort of frightening because you could really mess things up here you get the wrong people all of the sudden youre choking on the air quality in a class 1 pristine area
5020583 we actually have a philosophy that is relatively consistent with gov ritters and ken salazars
5020584 we want to make sure that our technology is prudently and cautiously developed and that it results in something that is economically viable environmentally responsible and socially sustainable
5020585 development of oil shale in colorado could significantly affect the councils ability to serve existing customers and the future growth projected for the front range of colorado
5020586 even though the benefits of oil shale are nationwide in terms of the impact on overall oil prices the environmental impacts of oil shale are almost 100 percent colorado
5020587 they say around here that you talk over whiskey and fight over water we will dig our heels in when it comes to our water
5020588 het is nog niet te zeggen hoe ernstig het is maar ik wilde in deze wedstrijd geen risico nemen we moeten bekijken of hij tegen pakistan weer kan spelen
5020589 ik hoop dat we hem daarmee weer op de been kunnen krijgen
5020590 een sporter wordt thuis geprepareerd fysiek emotioneel tactisch en mentaal ik zie geen reden om dat te veranderen
5020591 een judoka die je met de hand de tatami op en af moet brengen wint echt geen medaille
5020592 het zal bij een aantal sporters misschien zo zijn dat kan ook niet anders in een groep van ruim 240 sporters ik heb ook niet de illusie dat 240 atleten optimaal op het mentale vlak zijn begeleid als je niet direct de oorzaak weet van het falen schuiven mensen het vaak op mentale oorzaken er zullen ook coaches zijn die dat onderdeel niet helemaal in hun vingers hebben als je mentale begeleiders meeneemt moet je ook andere experts meenemen op de spelen heb je te maken met beperkingen je moet keuzes maken mijn mening is hier in peking niet veranderd
5020593 we moeten niet denken dat alleen nederland en australi kunnen hockeyen maar wij hebben de afgelopen tijd de prijzen niet gehaald en daarom is dit een goed resultaat
5020594 groot brittanni moet dan met een nulletje of zes van australi winnen dat zie ik niet gebeuren bovendien gaan we ook tegen pakistan voor de winst want ik wil het ritme niet onderbreken
5020595 he is so without artifice he speaks directly from the heart
5020596 the supreme court of india ordered google microsoft and yahoo to stop serving up adverts for sites that promote sex selection services
5020597 we take local laws extremely seriously and will review the petition carefully
5020598 stop making me look bad im not a wife who does everything for a man
5020599 pienso en un club con f tbol a la sudamericana y organizaci n europea me gusta la idea de un deportista que sabe lo que es manejar un club al estilo de beckenbauer
5020600 los socios de river me dir n si me ven como una opci n importante para eso lo que hago d a a d a es prepararme y no es f cil me lleva la vida
5020601 pero lo creo posible y creer posible algo es hacerlo cierto

5020603 el ambiente de la villa me ha dado una energ a extra con los compa eros siempre cerca y con otros atletas espa oles anim ndote cada d a no ha sido como es habitual en un hotel todos ellos me han servido de una gran ayuda aunque ellos no los sepan gracias a ellos tengo una medalla
5020604 no me hab a imaginado estar en el podio pero es especial he o do alguna vez o r el himno espa ol como cuando gan roland garros y alguna otra vez pero nada como aqu en los juegos ol mpicos es especial
5020605 supongo que colocar la medalla en el mismo lugar que el resto de trofeos estoy feliz por ser campe n ol mpico y haberlo logrado es un gran placer
5020606 no me dijo nada especial s lo que disfrute de este momento y me felicit porque he jugado muy bien toda la semana

5020615 los entrenadores me indicaron qu era lo que ten a que hacer para corregir algunos defectos en la manera de sacar los pu os y eso me ayudo

5020623 de mi pr ximo rival estoy seguro que los entrenadores sabr n todo
5020624 estar en una final en juegos ol mpicos es algo muy dif cil algo emocionante
5020625 mi meta era hacer 340 puntos y no logr y estoy triste por eso
5020626 voy a terminar de estudiar me hace falta un a o para terminar mi carrera
5020627 estoy contento tras doce a os de hacer sacado medallas en juegos ol mpics y mundiales y haber logrado el r cord del mundo
5020628 la identidad de un pa s y la cultura de una gente
5020629 nunca me va a saber una plata a oro cuando cruzas segundo es distinto a cuando cruzas en cabeza porque cuando cruzas segundo ves al primero
5020630 estamos en el medallero y ya somos parte de la historia de este evento s lo hay 50 pa ses en el medallero de estos juegos
5020631 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5020632 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state next week
5020633 better to make yourself briefly unpopular than to become permanently compromised
5020634 after athens she has waited four years and she had to say to herself that she has to be strong because she wanted to win a medal
5020635 it was very difficult for her but it was the only way for her to help him and competing put her in good mind
5020636 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures
5020637 i said damn they might pull a jones on me
5020638 it was no disrespect to the fighter but there was no point for me to be in there
5020639 i had some pressure because it was going to be the first medal for cuba here but the team prepares me very well
5020640 im prepared to beat the olympic champion or the world champion
5020641 el gonz lez perdi su chance en el segundo set
5020642 si federer lo ha hecho yo tambi n deber a poder hacerlo y contar con toda esa gama de golpes
5020643 t cnicamente y ten sticamente federer es y ha sido el mejor de la historia el m s completo
5020644 ma ana ser el n mero uno pero igual habr torneos donde estar de segundo y es seguro que otra vez estar segundo en el r nking en alg n momento
5020645 pero no tengo tiempo para celebrar quiz s despu s de nueva york donde jugar ahora el u s open y de la copa davis
5020646 es que una fotograf a que nos tomaron juntos sali un poco corrida y ojal lo pueda volver a ver para tomar otra
5020647 lo que est haciendo es una monstruosidad y s de lo que hablo de lo dif cil que es ganar
5020648 no me sent nervioso ni con presi n a pesar de que le abr el camino a mis compa eros
5020649 no hice una gran pelea pero mi rival tampoco se prest para boxear
5020650 creo que tir muchos m s golpes y el castigo que le hicieron con los puntos estuvo justificado
5020651 la verdad es que no hemos tenido mucha suerte pero este triunfo se lo dedico a todos los compa eros con los que tanto hemos trabajado
5020652 ver una puntuaci n final de 11 9 favorable a mi rival cuando lo m ximo que hizo son cuatro es para abandonar el cuadril tero sin que se tratase de ofender a nadie simplemente no ten a que continuar all
5020653 le met todos los golpes del mundo lo dej tocado y le hicieron cuenta de protecci n y al final pierdo la pelea
5020654 lanc m s de 20 golpes en cada asalto y llegaron claros al cuerpo de mi rival pero nada serv a para los jueces
5020655 no pienso que perd la pelea y lo mismo me paso en los juegos panamericanos por lo que considero que en la vida muchas veces hay cosas que son equivocadas
5020656 tan mala suerte para m que una peg en el poste y hay que asimilarlo y tratar de llegar bien al pr ximo partido
5020657 este tipo de derrotas calan hondo puesto que fue atlas quien hizo la mayor a del gasto jugamos al cien por ciento dimos todo en la cancha creo que en ese aspecto nos vamos contentos pero ellos convirtieron el gol tuvieron la ocasi n y lo hicieron
5020658 es el puntero del torneo san luis no nos dej luch hasta el final y bueno nosotros tambi n tuvimos nuestras ocasiones yo tuve unas cuantas y las malogr pero eso se trabajar en la semana para estar bien
5020659 i like you so much better when you re naked
5020660 manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the republic of the philippines
5020661 i started pretty well but then struggled on the back nine the same as yesterday
5020662 what a day if my chiropractor had been here he might have told me to pull out so im glad he wasnt
5020663 after all ive been through i was going to finish no matter what
5020664 i just see it as a challenge and its fun to be in this position trying to make others angry its getting really tight but im enjoying it
5020665 perhaps history this century thought eigenvalue is rippled with gathers in its fabric such that if we are situated as stencil seemed to be at the bottom of a fold its impossible to determine warp woof or pattern anywhere else by virtue however of existing in one gather it is assumed there are others compartmented off into sinuous cycles each of which had come to assume greater importance than the weave itself and destroy any continuity thus it is that we are charmed by the funny looking automobiles of the 1930s the curious fashions of the 1920s the particular moral habits of our grandparents we produce and attend musical comedies about them and are conned into a false memory a phony nostalgia about what they were we are accordingly lost to any sense of a continuous tradition perhaps if we lived on a crest things would be different we could at least see

5020668 politicians try to express a view out of the mainstream their words are pounced on and quoted out of context by hostile media and political opponents now it seems politicians must feel obliged to dissociate themselves from reports published by independent bodies which they have not commissioned and whose authors may not even belong to their political party
5020669 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
5020670 my old daddys got a brand new way to love
5020671 they gave it an old time feel and experimented by putting it in the middle of a downtown environment
5020672 to me whats so amazing about the number is that other ballparks that have been built since are not on pace to reach 50 million in 17 seasons
5020673 its a ballpark that attracts tourists from other parts of the country and while theyre here they spend money in baltimore
5020674 therefore i still contend with you declares the lord and with your childrens children i will contend 10 for cross to the coasts of cyprus and see or send to kedar and examine with care see if there has been such a thing 11 has a nation changed its gods even though they are no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit 12 be appalled o heavens at this be shocked be utterly desolate declares the lord 13 for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed out cisterns for themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water
5020675 he just wasnt there mentally and i didnt prepare myself
5020676 its a great opportunity to share a slice of life in small town america in the midst of an engaging democratic process
5020677 im sure well learn a lot in the process and so will arabs about us
5020678 the u s government does not like al jazeera because theres a sense they feed into anti u s sentiment
5020679 its mission is to represent the arab streets to the rest of the world and present the rest of the world to the arab streets
5020680 its not what you want at an olympics but thats what happens in sports
5020681 so you go out there do your best and you look at it and evaluate and get better

5020683 you come into it wanting to see the best and see what you can do
5020684 im going to go back and learn from it then hopefully in four years you will see me here again
5020685 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
5020686 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
5020687 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country

5020694 it is believed mr rahemtula wants the supreme court library to take over the justice and attorney general jag department library which currently serves 87 magistrates scattered across the state
5020695 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5020696 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5020697 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
5020698 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

5020713 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
5020714 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
5020715 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
5020716 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

5020722 honour killings are accepted in some middle eastern cultures but not accepted in iranian culture
5020723 they sometimes happen in remote areas of iran but there are no cases of iranians doing this in the us
5020724 while we believe strongly in freedom of expression we also believe in the importance of constructive dialogue between artists and the communities they seek to portray
5020725 the iranian american community should engage in dialogue with directors and producers in hollywood to ensure that the depiction of iranian americans

5020731 i had a difficult youth my father wasnt in the house ive written about this there were times where i experimented with drugs i drank in my teenage years and what i traced this to is a certain selfishness on my part i was so obsessed with me and the reasons that i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people

5020737 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5020738 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5020739 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5020741 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5020742 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5020743 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily

5020746 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5020747 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5020748 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5020749 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5020750 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5020751 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5020752 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5020753 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5020754 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5020755 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5020756 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5020757 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5020758 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5020759 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5020760 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5020761 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5020762 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5020763 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5020764 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration

5020782 the very wealthy have the means to avoid this tax
5020783 knowing that the estate tax as it is now is due to expire in 2010 is of a great concern because none of us know what it will be replaced with
5020784 overall we need to get some closure on this one badly
5020785 what were doing is hanging onto a sunsetting provision which makes planning really difficult for everybody
5020786 by exempting all estates under 7 million obamas plan will shield all but about 100 estates with small business income from any estate taxation
5020787 senator obamas plan would completely exempt 99 7 of estates from taxation
5020788 the goal is to allow small business to grow and expand
5020789 theres ample room in the spending side to undo the explosion of spending seen in the past eight years

5020856 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5020857 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5020858 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5020859 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5020860 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5020861 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5020862 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5020863 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5020864 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5020865 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5020866 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5020867 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5020868 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5020869 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5020870 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5020871 hey peter the sales for this particular title are flagging what can we do to raise things up
5020872 okay that incarnation of the hulk seems to be running its course time to come up with something else
5020873 oh theyre doing something new and different with the hulk lets see
5020874 it was great to hear one of my favorite writers talk honestly about his work
5020875 this cat does extensive research i mean he puts in the kind of research that like james lipton would have his crew do on largehearted boy
5020876 i was interviewed by a very bright and engaging fellow
5020877 wow do i tell him things i wouldnt expect to say in an interview hes that good its the closest ive come to being on pamela ribon
5020878 very seldom do i get to say all these things because im not asked about them and i appreciate your asking
5020879 hes a funny smart guy and asked a lot of good questions
5020880 one of the great literary interviewers of our time listen for how often his subjects are struck by his discovery of an unknown to them pattern of imagery or tic of diction
5020881 that should have been my first warning when you first said ill give you a softball question like theres going to be a hardball but what
5020882 i know who you are i know exactly what you do
5020883 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
5020884 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
5020885 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever
5020886 i cannot believe she would question the importance of the bat segundo show
5020887 really a matt segundo who is vamping it up with a vampire accent
5020888 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts
5020889 a terrific literary podcast that boasts some absolutely stellar author interviews
5020890 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5020891 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5020892 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5020893 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5020894 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5020895 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5020896 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5020897 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5020898 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5020899 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5020900 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5020901 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5020902 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5020903 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5020904 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5020905 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5020906 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5020907 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5020908 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5020909 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5020910 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5020911 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5020912 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5020913 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5020914 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5020915 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5020916 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5020917 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5020918 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5020919 ich sehe eine sp rbare abschw chung aber noch keinen absturz der deutschen wirtschaft der die bezeichnung rezession rechtfertigen w rde
5020920 ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people and in our case weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help
5020921 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5020922 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5020923 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5020924 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5020929 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5020930 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5020931 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5020932 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5020933 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5020934 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5020935 era dif cil conseguir a medalha mas estou feliz pois cumpri meu objetivo de chegar final sobrou for a no exerc cio por isso pisei fora se n o fosse isso acredito que terminaria na 4 ou 5 coloca o independente disso encerro minha participa o em jogos ol mpicos satisfeita por tudo que conquistei acho que fiz minha parte consegui quebrar barreiras e colocar o brasil em lugares nunca antes alcan ados

5020987 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric probably very empty rhetoric
5020988 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5020989 by putting up interceptors poland is placing itself at risk in terms of priority such targets are the first to be destroyed
5020990 this is in some ways a real throwback to the pre 1991 days to the old soviet union
5020991 we are obviously going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia
5020992 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past

5021009 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5021010 is good news for strategic planners in the automotive business that have spent the last 18 months on hold pending this merger

5021015 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5021016 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5021017 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5021018 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5021019 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5021020 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5021021 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5021022 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5021023 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5021024 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5021025 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5021026 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5021027 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5021028 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5021029 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5021030 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5021031 the current recession and risks of a systemic financial crisis
5021032 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5021033 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5021034 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5021035 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5021036 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5021037 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5021038 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5021039 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5021040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5021041 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5021042 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5021043 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5021044 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5021045 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5021046 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5021047 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5021048 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5021049 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5021050 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5021051 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5021052 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5021053 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5021054 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5021055 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5021056 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5021057 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5021058 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5021059 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5021060 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5021061 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5021062 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5021063 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5021064 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5021065 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

5021072 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5021073 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5021074 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5021076 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5021077 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5021078 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5021079 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5021091 i think were all devastated im proud of what weve done in the last few years but the gold was what we came for weve failed to meet our own standards we always said that silver wouldnt be good enough for us
5021092 its bizarre the rational side of my brain is saying i cant be upset with a silver but the emotional side is still very raw because we were capable of winning gold
5021093 my rational side has got to wrest control because im probably only going to stand on an olympic medal podium once in my life so ive got to make sure i enjoy it
5021094 this may sound strange but a big positive is that weve seen guys win silver medals and theyre far from ecstatic about it thats a strong sign of what were aiming for

5021132 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
5021133 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

5021149 now we start to really follow what we need to go quicker
5021150 like i said yesterday our bike is really not too bad but we lose a couple of tenths and this couple of tenths is not so easy to find thats why were going to test a different chassis
5021151 i know suzuki are still working really hard on the engine side and on the dyno in japan i dont really know when we can test the engine but maybe after motegi we have a lot of new things but suzuki are pretty open i can see them working really hard to make many different products
5021152 for me this is like a victory because ive really enjoyed working for suzuki all season
5021153 im talking about the future but at this moment im not signed with suzuki id say our agreement is nearly done but im not signed yet
5021154 for sure i really love working with suzuki and im saying that not because i finished on the podium today but because a couple of races ago when i was not in good condition suzuki stayed really close to me and supported me
5021155 this is really good its really nice to have people believe me this is why im ready to do everything for suzuki because my dream is to fight for victory again and i know we can
5021156 we know we made a little step on the settings but the problem was on saturday we had shit conditions and rain and we could do nothing
5021157 this morning in the warm up we tried to change a lot on the bike but unfortunately the weather was so cold that the tyres didnt work in the right way and we also lost time this morning this was why we decided to go back to the settings we used on friday
5021158 for sure we lost time because this year weve never fought well all weekend
5021159 casey pushed very hard on the first lap a lot more than laguna seca because he expected me to attack and i ended the first lap with a one second disadvantage already
5021160 but after one lap i understood that today it was possible
5021161 i had a great pace and my tyre choice was the right one after the warm up we found some improvements in the bike and on the last lap before the stoner crashed i gained 1 3s on him and i was very confident i could take him
5021162 but the race is very long so i was thinking i can i can i can and then i saw the red bike sliding away and i thought ah easier
5021163 it is an important advantage but it is too early there are still six races to go
5021164 so i have to continue like this i try to beat him but if it is not possible then i will finish behind no worse than second

5021177 the goods are registered by a camera integrated in the scales an image evaluation algorithm compares the image with stored data and thus automatically recognizes which type of fruit this is says voth even the cloudy plastic bags in which the fruit may be packaged at the counter are no problem for the scales the image evaluation system recognizes the various types of fruit and vegetable anyway
5021178 many types of fruit are a different color depending how ripe they are bananas for instance range from a uniform green to yellow or even spotted brown other types of fruit such as apples and pears come in numerous varieties that can likewise vary widely in color the new scales are very tolerant to fluctuations in color and brightness the module can be employed under many different kinds of illumination and with different kinds of camera supermarket employees can of course extend the selection of fruit recognized by the scales to make it include new varieties says voth

5021201 okay but i do know the theme song to the short lived early seventies sitcom lotsa luck wanna hear it
5021202 no its not a yes im not interested in the insular framework youve created here outside of this site youre an ineffectual nobody a magnet for disdain i fart in your general direction and yeah thats an original line so dont go using it when im not around or so help me ill get the lawyers involved in a joking kind of way of course still dont im serious
5021203 okay i dont want to get on your bad side youre like a feral cat i admire your animal ways the musk of your matted mange its invigorating
5021204 you know what your problem is besides being dull uncreative unfunny unimaginative unintelligible unintelligent and a fraud who steals other peoples ingenious talking beaver gags youre thin skinned to point of psy cho sis brother you need help
5021205 well you would wouldnt you because you cant take criticism tell me have you ever stepped back and taken a look at yourself because trust me youre a fucking headcase
5021206 interesting so what youre saying then is less me more

5021216 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5021217 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5021218 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5021219 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5021220 the social role of sport is to provide an outlet for intelligent people to behave like brainless people
5021221 intelligent people also recognise the costs of sport severe and permanent injuries which burden our hospitals every weekend but sport is a sanctioned release from responsible thinking and all these scruples are put aside the whole point of sport is to insulate you from the things that matter
5021222 the habit of getting excited and screaming for no good reason creates a momentary dome of ignorance its a hallowed asylum of folly a carnivalesque institution of mania against the onus of wisdom
5021223 i was therefore sceptical of the basil sellers art prize why conceive a lucrative prize around sport sport is the antithesis of art because art is all about the purpose beyond the work art engenders speculation a portal to new insights and imaginative growth like music science and philosophy art promotes an intoxicating wonder for where the mind can reach sport offers no similar transcendence because it lacks any admirable purpose beyond its own arbitrary exertions

5021228 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5021229 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5021230 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5021231 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5021232 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5021233 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5021234 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5021235 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5021236 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5021237 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5021238 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5021239 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5021240 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5021241 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5021242 we have to consider what else happened in the markets and that is precisely as most of the experts had suggested once the executive ban on oil drilling offshore had been lifted we have seen a huge decline of approximately 13 percent decline in the price of crude oil and gasoline prices actually begin to roll back over the course of 11 days which is remarkable isnt it
5021243 it is certainly remarkable and the vast majority of americans do support offshore oil drilling they support anything anything that will give them relief from high gas prices
5021244 bushs move to end the moratorium in place since 1992 wont have any effect until a separate congressional prohibition expires or is overturned
5021245 point to two distinct trends that may take the wind out of this years price spike an easing of tensions over iran and evidence that demand for oil in the u
5021246 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
5021247 the average field size in the pacific and atlantic regions tends to be smaller than the average in the gulf of mexico implying that a significant portion of the additional resource would not be economically attractive to develop at the reference case prices
5021248 theres abundant resources in the view of the people who are in the business that could be exploited within a period of months so offshore drilling is something we have to do
5021249 five republicans in name only rinos are siding with the no new drilling crowd in congress and basically
5021250 youve probably already heard the news five rinos are trying to strike a deal with the devil and theyre calling it a compromise
5021251 but like last years so called attempted compromise on amnesty for 12 20 million illegal aliens it is no such thing
5021252 eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees
5021253 essentially there is a gang of ten senators five republicans led by lindsey graham john thune saxby chambliss bob corker and johnny isaakson they joined five democrats to craft an energy bill in the senate that is exactly what barack obama wants
5021254 thats not compromise thats essentially the same scam liberals have been perpetrating on the american people all along
5021255 and make no mistake right now at this very minute these ten senators are advancing their treacherous case

5021278 she always wanted to know the details the context and the history nothing escaped her interest this was the only way she ever experienced life and she expected the same of her children

5021481 i feel the player loses value if he is not eligible for the champions league you cannot sell a player at the same price every club will consider that i have a shortlist but the list was always short
5021482 jillian can you hear me or are you deaf because if you can hear me and are thinking of an answer say dr im thinking of the answer to at least acknowledge the fact that i asked you a question
5021483 you are answering this question painfully slow to the point of putting me to sleep
5021484 es algo que no hay que tener en el olvido
5021485 ante la situaci n cr tica energ tica que hay en todo el mundo puede que tengamos que replantear algunas pol ticas de energ a nuclear
5021486 es el estado el que debe hacer frente a ese tipo de pol ticas
5021487 seguramente la uni n europea tambi n tendr que marcar unas directrices sobre ese tipo de pol ticas
5021488 una cifra importante para la comunitat y nada para el gobierno de espa a quien tiene la competencia pero no se hace cargo
5021489 garantiza la asistencia urgente a todos los extranjeros aunque no est n empadronados
5021490 si a esto le a adimos la falta de facultativos y la sobrecarga de las urgencias aunque las consultas sean m s r pidas y m s modernas podr amos decir que la situaci n se ha desbordado
5021491 en verano estas caracter sticas vigentes en la sanidad se duplican en las zonas tur sticas
5021492 780 000 turistas hacen uso del sistema valenciano de salud de los que el gobierno de espa a cobra de los respectivos pa ses de origen pero no lo revierte al consell que es quien se hace cargo de los gastos ocasionados
5021493 los grandes problemas sanitarios de la comunitat valenciana pasan por una financiaci n inadecuada y que con la ley de aseguramiento sanitario se pone orden para saber a qui n facturar
5021494 no nos cansamos de pedir m s dinero hasta que se revise el modelo de financiaci n vigente porque a diferencia del gobierno de espa a a adi el de francisco camps no permite que haya un mill n de valencianos contribuyentes sin beneficiarse de la sanidad las pol ticas de bienestar social y la educaci n los tres pilares fundamentales para una sociedad moderna como es la nuestra
5021495 los socialistas y concretamente los valencianos est n de acuerdo en que se atienda a los pacientes que cada d a acuden a los centros de la salud valencianos en condiciones de primera o de segunda porque parece que les da igual
5021496 no intervienen por los intereses de los valencianos ya que los han apartado para centrarse en sus intereses partidistas respecto a sus ambiciones de cara a su congreso
5021497 destina el 40 por ciento de su presupuesto a sanidad
5021498 si recibi ramos el dinero que se nos debe y el que nos pertenece la sanidad ir a mucho mejor
5021499 debe a la generalitat 227 millones de euros m s por los servicios prestados a los 36 000 funcionarios del estado
5021500 las mutuas que pagan al ministerio pero ste no las paga a la generalitat
5021501 es urgente tambi n por parte del gobierno central la revisi n del c digo penal en el que se debe considerar las agresiones al personal sanitario como delito y no como falta como se contempla hasta el momento
5021502 las personas no pueden temer por su seguridad ya que supone un obst culo a la hora de desempe ar su trabajo

5021504 it is obvious that india needs to substantially increase its per capita energy consumption to provide a minimally acceptable level of wellbeing to its people india is determined that its per capita greenhouse gas emissions will at no point exceed those of developed countries
5021505 means india wont stop its per capita emissions now at 1 02 t from growing until they match those of countries such as the us now at 20 t

5021517 yet the honda cbr1000rr fireblade is also idiot proof docile and real world responsive too
5021518 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5021519 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5021520 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5021521 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5021522 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5021523 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5021524 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5021525 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5021526 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5021527 sais tu que tu entres en mon me plus souvent que toute autre pens e
5021528 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5021529 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5021530 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5021531 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5021532 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5021533 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5021534 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5021535 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5021536 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5021537 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5021538 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5021539 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5021540 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5021541 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5021542 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5021543 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5021544 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5021545 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5021546 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5021547 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5021548 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5021549 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5021550 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5021551 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5021552 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5021553 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5021554 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5021555 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5021556 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5021557 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5021558 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5021559 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5021560 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5021561 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5021562 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5021563 who are open to doing something on the production side
5021564 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5021565 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5021566 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5021567 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5021568 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5021569 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5021570 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5021571 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5021572 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5021573 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5021574 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5021575 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5021576 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5021577 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5021578 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5021579 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5021580 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5021581 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5021582 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5021583 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5021584 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5021585 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5021586 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5021587 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5021588 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5021589 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5021590 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5021591 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5021592 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5021593 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5021594 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5021595 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5021596 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5021597 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5021598 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5021599 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5021600 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5021601 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5021602 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5021603 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5021604 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5021605 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5021606 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5021607 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5021609 gerne weise ich darauf hin da die brights sich als naturalisten aber nicht unbedingt als atheisten verstehen
5021610 unter naturalismus versteht man die auffassung da es nichts als den inhalt unseres raum zeit systems gibt das hei t da es nur materielles gibt
5021611 es gibt demnach zum beispiel keine geister keine seelen keine nichtmaterielle energie keine platonischen ideen und keinen gott
5021612 das weltbild eines bright ist frei von bernat rlichen und mystischen elementen
5021613 wenn es lehre der brights ist da der naturalismus wahr sei da der atheismus aber nicht zur lehre der brights geh re ist die lehre der brights selbstwiderspr chlich
5021614 was ist ein bright ein bright ist eine person mit einem naturalistischen weltbild frei von bernat rlichem wir brights glauben nicht an geister elfen oder den osterhasen oder an gott
5021615 die gemeinschaft der brights schlie t verschiedene naturalistische perspektiven und kategorien mit ein dazu geh ren auch einige auspr gungen pantheistischen gottesglaubens die bewegung ist keine atheistische bewegung

5021619 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
5021620 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5021621 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5021622 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5021623 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5021624 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
5021625 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to

5021814 we have a transparent country a free press even though anti government newspapers have suffered on the revenue side and self censorship is evident in the past few years we must look at these things carefully because when we lose it the effect would be large
5021815 i believe its important that hong kong does not become another chinese city our cost is from a few times higher in some categories to being 20 times higher in other categories such as low end labour so its extremely important that we maintain our edge
5021816 if achieving the hong kong dream becomes a vanishing hope then our society will suffer
5021817 what would the hong kong dream be its no different from the american dream whereby an everyday man on the street who works hard would be able to make good savings and use those savings as equity for their future small business
5021818 we had been busy building up fibre infrastructure under the ground in hong kong and underneath the homes of people so when we launched iptv it was relatively smoother sailing than in other territories

5021829 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5021830 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
5021831 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
5021832 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule
5021833 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

5021860 thats what we kind of envisioned during the first part of the race where we just wanted to think about us for what we could do i made a call for the 1984 girls and were gonna do them proud and we just started motoring to the finish line
5021861 the first thing you want to do is jump out of the boat and jump out of your skin but you dont have enough energy left to do it
5021862 we kept trying really hard until the end and it feels great
5021863 but theyve just able to focus on what they need to do theyre very professional but the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear they came down smiling to the boat house which was a good sign
5021864 we were streamlined we just looked straight ahead i cant really remember any other boats out there to be honest because it was all about how fast we could go it was the most beautiful peace
5021865 our goal was to not lose any ground we just wanted to row our race and we did we got faster every 500 it felt like we got faster but i dont know it got harder every 500 put it that way
5021866 and i just started smiling everybody smiled because this was a sweet rhythm and it just gives them confidence i mean i was almost having to be the calming aspect because they were ramping it up and we just needed to let that hunter go and just force that rhythm and just let that rhythm go and it was nice
5021867 thats the great thing about being in that bow seat you can see everybody ahead of you and if they were making a move gosh dang it im gonna make a move harder than that so it was fun it was fun being back there watching all that unfold we saw romania push we saw netherlands push but i think we had an answer

5021874 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
5021875 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
5021876 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens

5021909 no hay ning n avance en el futuro con respecto a los problemas que tenemos en la actualidad
5021910 es una especie de exageraci n grotesca de la vida normal de cuatro personas en una oficina el capit n se cree tocado por un destino divino y todos los que lo rodean saben que es un pobre hombre como en toda oficina trabaja la t pica chica que est buen sima pero a la que no tienes acceso y ah est siempre ese individuo superaplicado que intenta hacerlo todo bien y no consigue llevar adelante nada

5021912 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5021913 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5021914 we would as part of our ongoing crackdown on hoon driving consider this
5021915 anything that protects the community from the scourge of hoon drivers the liberal party would support
5021916 the evidentiary value of it may be negligible unless its integrity can be assured
5021917 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5021918 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5021919 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5021920 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5021921 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5021922 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5021923 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5021924 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5021925 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5021926 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely
5021927 im shocked by the comments because theres lots of sexy cowboys and cowgirls up there
5021928 the 2006 census shows where there is an imbalance its not an extreme one
5021929 i am concerned about the gender imbalance but not issues such as looks thats pretty superficial
5021930 the departments review of overtime identified it exceeded budget by 23 million

5021933 i want to solve the situation in the hills in a friendly environment
5021934 we must solve the problem that has risen in the darjeeling hills in a peaceful and friendly environment i have full faith in solving problems through dialogue
5021935 the formation of newer states does not arise we can discuss on the darjeeling gorkha hill council which is a fully functional and powerful setup we have already met twice with the representatives of gorkha janmukti morcha they have demanded for a tripartite meeting we are now discussing on the possibility of holding tripartite meets at principal secretary level however we have not yet been able come up with a date but the fact still remains that gorkhaland is not possible even the gorkha janmukti morcha leadership must have by now realized that gorkhaland is not possible
5021936 it is a known fact that the grass root level cadres have been living and operating in the most inhumane of conditions this condition cannot exist for long its end is near
5021937 we should not come under the influence of racial pride and retaliate or resort to violence peace between the hills and the plains must be maintained at all cost we will not tolerate any racial or ethnic overtures made by organizations in the plains if organizations like janjagaran manch instigate ethnic strife and tension we will take adequate measures against them we will also not give in to politics of blackmail being pursued by gorkha janmukti morcha in the hills all attempts to install parallel governance will be frustrated gorkha janmukti morcha has been issuing farmans and verdicts including those forcing the people to change the vehicle registration plates the west bengal government will not accept these
5021938 the problem in the hills cannot be solved by deploying the police and by enforcing a police regime we have to be patient and insist on dialogue
5021939 for she is indeed a complicated individual thats full of surprises as seen from her interest for just about anything

5021995 whether youre a new or seasoned dater love sex lies is in my view the first and last book that you will ever need to read to truly understand the online dating scene thanks to yvonne rices depth of research coupled with her wry sense of humour this book provides a clear accurate and immensely well balanced view of the good the bad and the ugly sides of internet dating in all of its forms she exposes the truth warts and all but still leaves you with a real optimism that internet dating is and will continue to be an enormously positive and fun experience and an essential part of our everyday lives
5021996 yvonne rice really opened my eyes to what really happens on online dating sites her depth of research is amazing people who already are dating online or who plan to give it a try owe it to themselves to read this book yvonne rice prepares her readers for any obstacle they might encounter when dating and socializing on the internet she also proves that the internet is the best and most effective way to begin a romantic relationship in this hectic high tech times in which we live

5022044 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
5022045 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
5022046 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
5022047 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they might tend to listen to that advice more

5022050 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking

5022057 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
5022058 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
5022059 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
5022060 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart

5022104 there are many talented singers who aspire to make a career in singing but cant fulfil their dreams because of various reasons we will be producing albums for those talented singers
5022105 in spite of having enormous talent people opt for other profession to support their family the company will provide a platform to those individuals with talent as the sole criterion
5022106 we plan to give away free cds of the new artistes with every cd of the established singers we will use the popularity of these renowned artistes to promote the album of the new singers
5022107 we are not doing it for any professional gain it is a service to those talented artistes living in india and abroad who could not fulfil their dreams because life did not give them the opportunity
5022108 the decision of the licensor dot in this regard shall be final and binding
5022109 we wanted to have a mechanism where a common person can get a sim card without any hassles and other security concerns are also met
5022110 the truth is that since the last year or so i havent got good film offers at all trash was coming to me in the name of scripts i am not insecure that i would go for any role im in a position now that i dont need to compromise
5022111 i took a sabbatical for a year and a half and that is when people in the industry realised my worth i have some good films now both as an actor and a producer and i am very happy
5022112 popcorn motion pictures is my obsession i started my career as a businessman with a restaurant and garment business but suniel shetty the businessman can take over only movies and not any other venture
5022113 action has risen to a different level today it is mostly special effects we used to perform our stunts on our own and today the actors use all kinds of props there lies a difference between men and boys now
5022114 after watching the show i think guys should stop talking about action and start getting inspired from women
5022115 ive learnt a lot today i understand my character i have tried my hand at everything from action romance to comedy im the only actor to have worked with over 90 directors and different roles

5022125 would you like six or 15 pieces of bacon with your eggs
5022126 i grew up on the he man cartoon and watched he man six days a week the notion that i think we most took from the cartoon are the characters and trying to find a way that is true to them
5022127 now at the same time we had to come up with why that is the way it is i mean youre talking about sword and sandal meets science fiction meets fantasy meets everything and how does that all kind of blend into the same world and so we had to come up with very specific rules that explained why trapjaw looks the way he looks and why cyclops who is awesome looks the way he looks
5022128 the script is very true to the characters were not talking about putting nipples on the trapjaw suit but we had to come up with a reason again why trapjaw would actually not just be something thats totally absurd but why he would need those bionic parts added to him
5022129 which gives a sort of sense of where the movie is going in some way
5022130 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
5022131 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
5022132 i see him as the jason bourne of superheroes a guy who exists with his own sort of set of tricks and i think the difference between ollie queen and a guy like bruce wayne theyre both rich they both have their things but batman is about his equipment and is about his theatricality and about his detective skills and green arrow is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type
5022133 totalmente congruente con el pacto que el sindicato nacional de trabajadores de la educaci n encabezado por elba esther gordillo mantienen con los gobiernos de derecha sean de pan o pri
5022134 mantiene un manejo del sistema educativo como si fuera un consorcio empresarial en el cual la secretaria de educaci n p blica no es m s que una sociedad an nima donde es la socia mayoritaria que puede pactar chantajear o presionar al presidente en turno y a los gobernadores
5022135 se hace presente el profundo choque entre dos grandes propuestas respecto de la educaci n y su mejor a por un lado el caudal de experiencias diversas que maestros y escuelas han generado a lo largo de la historia de la educaci n y por otra la iniciativa de capacitaci n para el trabajo que hacen empresarios y un gobierno privatizador dispuestos a entregar el petr leo y la educaci n a las fuerzas del mercado
5022136 capitalistas de enorme peso como alfredo harp hel ex presidente de banamex y mar a asunci n aramburuzabala due a de la cervecer a modelo
5022137 decorativos la alianza se inscribe dentro de un discurso ret rico en el que se afirma que el mayor inter s es por los ni os y la calidad de la educaci n pero el fondo real de su contenido no deja dudas estamos ante un estado evaluador entendida la evaluaci n como intervenci n
5022138 y no de las condiciones sociales que puedan influir en el proceso educativo es decir se lleva el proceso de maquilizaci n productiva a la escuela donde el alumno es visto como un producto mercantil lo que genera una pr ctica perversa
5022139 desobediencia e insurgencia magisterial que puede desembocar en un proceso similar o superior al de 1989
5022140 se da un golpe mortal al normalismo porque pr cticamente se dice que su curr cula su forma de ense anza y su pr ctica en el aula no sirven lo que abre todos los espacios a la formaci n del magisterio en instituciones privadas

5022142 we had a lot of shots and the game would have been lopsided if it wasnt for him he was big and challenged the shooter so well
5022143 he was a threat when he was on the ice but i see him as more of a set up guy than a shooter big kid and skates well
5022144 he was a solid player who excelled in all three zones
5022145 a big player who can skate but he really didnt get as much ice time as he should have
5022146 sweden always has a tendency to underplay their best players for some reason like nicklas backstrom when he was at the world juniors
5022147 there are athletes and east palestine graduates among the hall of fame members
5022148 but the recognition is also extended to other people who live here have moved into the area or who have lived here at one time people who have ties here those people who have dedicated themselves to making a difference in the community
5022149 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan

5022164 call off the proposed peoples march tomorrow to the unmogip
5022165 as there were some highly sensitive offices and installations in the vicinity of the unmogip headquarters in the uptown sonawar area of the city
5022166 the two leaders told the representatives of the administration their request would be deliberated upon during the joint co ordination committees meeting today
5022167 we shall go ahead with our proposed public rally to the unmogip office tomorrow the source said
5022168 we have also appealed to the people to call off the ongoing shutdown from tuesday for three days after which the people will march to eidgah grounds on thursday and offer the friday prayers there
5022169 further programme of the joint co ordination committee would be announced at eidgah grounds on friday
5022170 but for the three days beginning tuesday people have been asked to resume normal activities of life
5022171 all vehicles private or public would move during these three days displaying black flags shops would remain open and go about their businesses as usual but each shop would display a black flag and office goers must wear black bands around their arms during duty hours
5022172 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
5022173 just the place for a snark i have said it twice

5022177 the festival has been very safe and the revellers are enjoying themselves in a good natured way
5022178 we have a highly visible police presence at the festival but have not had to intervene on many occasions
5022179 our only warning is regarding alcohol consumption just reminding revellers that excess drinking makes them vulnerable and they should take care of their possessions and look out for each other
5022180 all nine persons were active in the mumbai navi mumbai thane belt and used to steal cars only on demand a senior official said on saturday
5022181 but we are sure that none of these thieves is connected to the terror plot the official added some of the nine criminals are from mumbai and its neighbourhood but some are from gujarat and rajasthan
5022182 it was revealed during interrogation that one gang from madhya pradesh was very active here he said adding
5022183 pakistan is not a new member of uno but a successor to a member state which was one of the founders of the organisation
5022184 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5022185 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5022186 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5022187 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5022188 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5022189 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5022190 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5022191 quer a literalmente hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes sin la ayuda de mis compa eros no hubiese sido posible vinimos todos juntos como una unidad

5022195 revelation is always a concept denoting an act the word refers to the act in which god shows himself not to the objectified result of this act
5022196 and because this is so the receiving subject is always also a part of the concept of revelation where there is no one to perceive revelation no re vel ation has occurred because no veil has been removed by definition revelation requires a someone who apprehends it revelation precedes scripture and becomes deposited in scripture but is not simply identical with it
5022197 it is very important for us to stick to experience without disconnecting ourselves from this immediate perception for even an instant as soon as we disconnect ourselves we being a discourse that is pasted on to life and we no longer understand anything what fr giussani taught us is a look that passes from appearances to the you the ultimate depth of everything of reality and therefore it is through what you do that you realize that you are lacking something that the desire for something other is reawakened this is what i mean when i say that the idea of mystery is lacking it is not because i do something religious like saying morning prayer for example that the mystery comes in
5022198 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5022199 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5022200 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5022201 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5022202 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5022203 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5022204 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5022205 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5022206 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5022207 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5022208 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5022209 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5022210 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5022211 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5022212 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5022213 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5022214 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5022215 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5022216 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5022217 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5022218 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5022219 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5022220 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5022221 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5022222 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5022223 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5022224 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5022225 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5022226 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5022227 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5022228 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5022229 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5022230 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5022231 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5022232 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5022233 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5022234 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5022235 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5022236 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5022237 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5022238 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5022239 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5022240 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5022241 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5022242 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5022243 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5022244 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5022245 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5022246 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5022247 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5022248 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5022249 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5022250 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5022251 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5022252 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5022253 sollen wichtige entscheidungen auf eu ebene wie z b t rkei beitritt reformvertrag in sterreich einer volksabstimmung unterzogen werden auch wenn ein derartiges referendum nicht eu weit stattfindet
5022254 sollen die namen von sexualstraft tern und sexualstraft terinnen in sterreich in einem eigenen register aufgezeichnet und ver ffentlicht werden
5022255 justizministerin maria berger arbeitet an einer sexualstraft terdatei in die polizei und jugendamt einblick haben sollen
5022256 we have found there was another inconsistency in the police report that was given to us six weeks later and on the instruction of the minister
5022257 we have no comment to make until the legal team meets and deliberates on the report
5022258 i have seen the first medical report and privy to the second medical report based on that there is no case for me to answer
5022259 you can see the dirty campaign and the sheer hypocrisy of those who are both corrupt and immoral in using religion and the quran in this election
5022260 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5022261 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5022262 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5022263 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5022264 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5022265 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5022266 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5022267 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5022268 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5022269 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5022270 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5022271 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5022272 this is a planning took where all things are going
5022273 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5022274 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5022275 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5022276 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5022277 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5022278 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5022279 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5022280 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5022281 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5022282 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5022283 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5022284 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5022285 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5022286 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5022287 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5022288 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5022289 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5022290 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5022291 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5022292 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5022293 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5022294 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5022295 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5022296 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5022297 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5022298 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5022299 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5022300 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5022301 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5022302 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly

5022311 if we are going to install an additional 5 million servers before 2010 senior it executives had better understand the true cost of server ownership in order to make the right investment decisions it power consumption is going up so rapidly that data centers which used to cost 20 million to build now can cost 100 million and some are in the 500 million range excluding hardware and network costs
5022312 russian president dmitry medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5022313 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5022314 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5022315 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5022316 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5022317 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them

5022328 we need to be very consistent after the world cup we lacked a bit of consistency probably lack of form and a few personal changes but no excuses
5022329 we didnt consistently maintain our standards in the asia cup we managed to turn things around we were very consistent with the bat ball and in the field thats the toughest thing for most of the international teams to consistently be in that competitive level we need to do the hard work that we have done

5022340 justifying what the kgb people are doing in my country
5022341 when it comes to apportioning blame for the latest flareup in the caucasus theres plenty to go around the russians were clearly itching for a fight but the behaviour of georgian president mikhail saakashvili has been erratic and provocative the united states may have stoked the conflict by encouraging saakashvili to believe that he enjoyed american protection when the wests ability to impose its will in this part of the world is actually quite limited it is difficult to explain why kosovo should have the right to unilaterally declare its independence from serbia while the same right should be denied to places such as south ossetia and abkhazia
5022342 given how overt the kremlins aims are the fiery nationalist president of georgia mikheil saakashvili blundered grievously when he responded to small scale violence from local separatists in south ossetia by sending georgian troops to shell and assault the breakaway regions capital city
5022343 even the most ardent adversaries of moscow have no choice but to accept it was georgian military forces that attacked the separatist pro russian province of south ossetia bombarding its capital and killing russian peacekeepers who had been there for 15 years following the un decision to maintain peace from the moment bush became president he has wanted russia to be isolated both economically and geographically he must think there is no difference between yesterdays soviet union and todays russia for a moment putin believed in bushs friendship and tried to provide some gauge of good will wasnt it him who removed russian military bases from cuba and vietnam has he not joined the osce and thats despite the disillusion and anger when the us installed military bases in central asia georgia the czech republic and poland

5022505 ges voglio conoscerti personalmente grazie davere sacrificato la tua vita per me affinch io possa essere giustificato davanti a dio desidero che tu entri nella mia vita accetto che tu sei il solo che possa darmi il potere di cambiare e di salvarmi da uneternit senza dio grazie per il perdono che viene per mezzo tuo ges e per avermi dato la vita eterna con dio prendi il controllo della mia vita fa di me la persona che volevi che io fossi quando mi hai creato

5022508 io sono venuto affinch abbiano la vita e labbiano in abbondanza
5022509 poich tutti hanno peccato e sono privi della gloria di dio
5022510 ma le vostre iniquit hanno prodotto una separazione fra voi e il vostro dio
5022511 ma dio manifesta il suo amore verso di noi in questo che mentre eravamo ancora peccatori cristo morto per noi
5022512 questo ges dio lo ha resuscitato e di questo noi tutti siamo testimoni
5022513 io sono la via la verit e la vita nessuno viene al padre se non per mezzo di me
5022514 voi infatti siete salvati per grazia mediante la fede e ci non viene da voi il dono di dio non per opere perch nessuno si glori
5022515 ecco io sto alla porta e busso se qualcuno ode la mia voce ed apre la porta io entrer da lui e cener con lui ed egli con me

5022520 the 1 6 liter four cylinder engine is surprisingly smooth and quiet and while gas mileage isnt great for a car this small its pretty darn good an epa rated 25 mpg in the city 34 mpg on the highway in our test car
5022521 headroom in the aveo5 is generous and rear seat room isnt that bad unless you have some long legged people in the front seat that room comes at the expense of luggage space in the back but the rear seat folds down
5022522 inside for the most part the aveo looked and felt surprisingly upscale but there were a few tipoffs to the fact that this is an inexpensive car while the flip down sun visors had vanity mirrors the mirrors were uncovered meaning that when the visors were down they reflected you and everything behind the car it was annoying enough that id have to use a strip of duct tape to cover them if i owned the car

5022531 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5022532 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5022533 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5022534 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5022535 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5022536 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5022543 if raffles was born in 1819 he was 7 years old when he died after marrying several wives fathering several children and catching syphilis
5022544 there could be a bit of a backlash for me because a lot of people are actually disappointed the liberals brought an outsider into the area in jamie briggs and hes a career politician and not really a representative of the community
5022545 thats hardly what you want for a clever innovative country
5022546 take away the rolls royces the bentleys the 100 000 plus vehicles were talking about carsof the sort that first introduced anti lock braking systems and airbags
5022547 manufacturers develop initiatives that are then used by others and trickle down if those initiatives are seen as luxuries rather than a great step forward for safety the luxury car tax is in fact a tax on innovation
5022548 mr bracks was astoundingly silent in relation to the luxury car tax
5022549 we do believe in liberalising trade we have one of the best records in the world when it comes to the fundamental structural adjustment
5022550 but part and parcel of that has been to provide transitional assistance as we bring down tariffs and thats what the governments going to do
5022551 what were doing is encouraging them to produce vehicles the rest of the world doesnt want to buy
5022552 if we want to be serious players in the export market then youve got to be making cars people want to buy
5022553 to the extent that a luxury tax increases the price of vehicles most of which are imported you would have to see it as a form of protection for the local industry
5022554 that may have been one reason why mr bracks didnt recommend any changes to the planned reduction of tariffs
5022555 a liberal government will give tough justice to the people who deserve it but try to help people that can be helped
5022556 this 40 million 80 bed young offender prison will not be for violent offenders but for those offenders that do not pose a risk to the public
5022557 it will mean these offenders will not have to mix with harder criminals and be corrupted it will free up beds in medium to maximum security prisons
5022558 there will also be a focus on helping offenders better prepare themselves for release and successful resettlement into the community
5022559 labors solution to the prison overcrowding crisis is to retain weak sentencing laws that release prisoners back into society before they are fully rehabilitated putting the community at risk
5022560 a liberal government will deliver tough laws and imprison offenders who break those laws
5022561 the polling shows the situation is evenly balanced and it nearly always is in western australia
5022562 youve got to make sure that you give people a reason to support you
5022563 theyre going to be focusing on climate change policy looking first at the two domestic emissions trading schemes and looking for similarities and differences
5022564 i expect theyll be exploring the potential for linking the two schemes
5022565 weve been saying we should really link to an australian ets market if we can because it enhances the range of least cost abatement opportunities and creates a bigger market
5022566 the bottom line here is that this is all about changing behaviour
5022567 linking us to new zealand might give us a backdoor exposure to the price of permits in europe
5022568 if european permits are more expensive than australian ones it becomes a way that puts pressure on the price of permits here the economic issues around this are very complicated in the rudd governments climate change green paper we didnt get a lot of the economics theyre still to come this clearly has to be very carefully handled

5022576 the only way in my mind that you can get new water into the murray
5022577 they want to be sure its not enough for it just to be likely its still too early for us to expect a change in auction results
5022578 if they do drop we will see a revival in the market for sure but it might take a while for it to change the results for domestic property
5022579 they dont account for off the plan our research shows the market has fared really well in this regard over the last quarter
5022580 this is a very good time for investors and smart investors are already making the most of the expected rates cut
5022581 lots of home buyers dont realise that it is a case of a tale of two sydneys

5022583 jenny is a special needs elephant shes unique shes afflicted with crippling depression the elephant sanctuary is the right choice
5022584 this is the first time government support of industry has been targeted at green cars
5022585 previously packages had been aimed at selling more cars whether or not they had lower greenhouse emissions
5022586 if we can arrange the uptake of alternative fuels such as lpg cng and ethanol that will reduce greenhouse gases if done properly
5022587 the aim of the project is to help make hydrogen a real alternative to fuels that emit carbon dioxide ultimately this is about opening up new markets for low cost fuel efficient hydrogen powered engines
5022588 it will be interesting to see the report given the criticism by the government of the regional partnerships program given that not one of the better regions grants has gone through any probity checks and balances and every single one of them was a pre election promise in labor and marginal seats
5022589 the proposed audit would examine the implementation and administration of the better regions program including the processes through which projects have been assessed and approved the delivery of approved projects and the financial management and accountability arrangements put in place
5022590 i still believe its critical to look at personal stories emotional circumstances and private histories in the study of suicide not just the biology and pharmacology of suicide and depression

5022623 na minha opini o ele putin o verdadeiro patr o da r ssia neste momento
5022624 as medidas que ele tomou na transi o de presidente a primeiro ministro nestas ltimas semanas e agora na ge rgia provam que putin quem manda na r ssia
5022625 penso que a rela o entre ele e medvedev mais complexa do que imagin vamos
5022626 penso que v amos eles como parceiros e putin tinha dado v rios sinais de que ia deixar o poder seguir seu curso e ficar com a presid ncia de que medvedev seria o verdadeiro respons vel por dirigir a r ssia
5022627 usam uma ret rica remanescente da uni o sovi tica
5022628 queremos que os russos que est o prontos para contemplar o futuro russos como talvez o presidente medvedev comecem a exercer uma maior influ ncia e consigam controlar a ret rica de certas pessoas
5022629 ele foi uma grande influ ncia na m sica e a primeira m sica que ouvi quando era garoto nossas fam lias eram bem amigas dorival era como um segundo pai para mim assim como meu pai era um segundo pai para dori a calma a tranqulidade e o ritmo lento de dorival era uma li o de vida porque tudo isso muito dif cil hoje em dia
5022630 todos n s somos imortais porque permanecemos na mem ria daqueles que gostam de n s o que vai acontecer com caymmi vou lembrar eternamente de caymmi pelo amigo pelas m sicas e pelo tempo de brasilidade caymmi e a mangueira s o um casamento perfeito a academis brasileira de letras que me desculpe mas para ser imortal basta fazer m sica poema pintura e jogar bola
5022631 lamento porque menos um bom brasileiro o dorival fazia m sicas f ceis de cantar que n o era preciso recorrer a dicion rios de filosofia ou de grego como as m sicas de hoje sou muito amigo de dori e de nana mas que n o tinha muito contato com dorival porque tinha medo de chegar perto desse mo o sagrado dorival faz jus s piadas de baiano porque era muito tranq ilo e uma figura encantadora muitas vezes v o embora as pessoas boas e permanecem as pragas que podiam ser levadas
5022632 vai com o caymmi muito da hist ria da m sica brasileira dorival era um buda baiano e uma lenda brasileira
5022633 complicado para n s para a m sica popular brasileira para o brasil e para f s a obra dele enorme e fica dif cil achar alguma m sica ruim ele foi um pai maravilhoso que me ajudava muito tamb m no mbito profissional sempre que tinha alguma d vida corria para pedir sua opini o ele era um grande pai amigo e parceiro l em cima deve estar a maior festa agora vai ter muito acaraj conhaque e chope por aqueles lados
5022634 liguei para dorival h tr s semanas queria fazer uma homenagem ainda em vida ao dorival foi uma alegria poder conviver com essa pe a fundamental da mpb o amor que tenho pelo meu pa s o mesmo que tenho por ele n o d para pensar em samba bahia e brasil sem ele
5022635 na poca ele ficou muito feliz com essa homenagem a m sica
5022636 meu av era muito amoroso sabia apreciar a beleza da vida e era silencioso ao compor
5022637 o brasil perdeu um grande mestre mas pessoas como caymmi n o morrem seguem encantados na vida e no imagin rio do povo brasileiro sua obra mostrava a hist ria de um povo e da mesti a na o brasileira em can es extremamente simples mas altamente sofisticadas por revelarem as sutilezas e as ra zes de uma na o oculta sublime complexa matriz da nossa utopia tantos s o os g nios que aqui tivemos mas caymmi g nio do brasil irresistivelmente brasileiro porque sua genialidade a express o do nosso povo
5022638 dorival caymmi um dos fundadores da m sica popular brasileira patriarca de uma linhagem de m sicos de talento suas can es praieiras e seus sambas can o s o patrim nio da cultura nacional brilhou e inovou como compositor m sico e cantor sua m sica uma completa tradu o da bahia foi com tristeza que recebi a not cia de sua morte meus sinceros p sames a sua esposa stella maris e a seus filhos nana dori e danilo sua obra permanecer sempre viva na mem ria dos brasileiros iluminando a todos com a gra a e a alegria de suas m sicas

5022942 quer a hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes
5022943 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
5022944 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
5022945 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
5022946 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5022947 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5022948 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5022949 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5022950 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5022951 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5022952 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5022953 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5022954 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
5022955 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5022956 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5022957 things are great and were moving on to the good stuff
5022958 weve both learned a lot and know that our family comes first and thats the main thing for both of us

5022964 over the past ten years we have taken control of our own lives we could not allow terrorists to dictate to us we will continue to do what is right for us
5022965 if i was with you today i would ask you to do one thing and that is to look to the future a new generation is growing up in omagh and it is to them that we should be looking

5022973 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5022974 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5023001 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5023006 its been a matter of state law that has been our tradition now lets break it down the reason that people that think there needs to be a constitutional amendment some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage

5023030 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes
5023031 generally speaking chinese athletes are not strong contenders in many events in the second half of the games

5023041 if since you love me you will keep my commandments
5023042 this point is a very fundamental cornerstone of our interaction with god the person who does not thoroughly understand that the relationship with god is built on a foundation of
5023043 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
5023044 that man does not live on bread alone but by the utterance of mouth does man live

5023070 the 17th street canal the source of most of the water swamping new orleans
5023071 officials and army corps engineers said that after they had found the widening gap in the concrete wall on the eastern side of the canal they had no quick response plan to repair it
5023072 along a section that was just upgraded it did not have an earthen levee it had a vertical concrete wall several feet thick
5023073 after failing to close a 300 foot break in the canal through which most of the floodwater entered the city federal engineers decided last night august 31st to take the battle with lake pontchartrain to the lakefront
5023074 there were still no clear hints why the main breach in the flood barriers occurred along the 17th street canal normally a conduit for vast streams of water pumped out of the perpetually waterlogged city each day and which did not take the main force of the waves roiling the lake he said that a low spot marked on survey charts of the levees near the spot that ruptured was unrelated and that the depression was where a new bridge crossed the narrow canal near the lakefront
5023075 theyve killed off the black vote base of the south
5023076 the 17th street levee was bombed by the army corps of engineers to save the more valuable real estate in the city to keep the french quarter protected the ninth ward was sacrificed people are afraid to speak out everyone who was near there heard the bombings they bombed seven times thats why they didnt fix the levees 20 feet of water gators people dying in water they let the parishes go not the city center tourist trap was saved over human life a six year old girl was raped in here 9 year old boy killed a man in the shower beaten no hot food no help for elderly

5023081 just months before hurricane katrina hit judah hertz made a big bet on new orleans real estate
5023082 the president of hertz investment group a santa monica calif real estate firm bought one downtown office tower in may for 45 million and another in july for 49 million making him the citys largest owner of high quality office buildings the two deals culminated a three year buying spree in which he snapped up roughly 200 million worth of commercial real estate in new orleans
5023083 he says insurance will cover the repairs and hes hired a restoration team that has begun assessing the damage and planning renovations
5023084 call him the larry silverstein of new orleans a new york real estate developer mr silverstein famously signed a 99 year lease on the office buildings at the world trade center just weeks before the 9 11 attacks four years ago even though mr silverstein received billions of dollars in insurance payments the conflicting demands of the site have made rebuilding a struggle
5023085 hurricane katrina might have battered new orleans and the gulf coast as a considerably weaker system than the category 4 tempest initially reported
5023086 new preliminary information compiled by hurricane researchers suggests the system struck southeast louisiana on aug 29 with peak sustained winds of 115 mph that would have made it a category 3 storm still a major hurricane but a step down from the enormous destructive force of a category 4
5023087 katrina might have further downgraded to a strong category 1 system with 95 mph winds when it punched water through new orleans levees severely flooding most of the city and killing hundreds the levees were designed to withstand a category 3 storm
5023088 powell said the new data show that katrina packed 95 mph winds over the east end of lake pontchartrain and about 65 mph over the west end
5023089 in downtown new orleans the winds were barely hurricane strength because buildings disrupted the flow he said that is information he suspects new orleans residents dont want to hear
5023090 new orleans mayor on friday proposed building a casino zone near the historic french quarter to jump start the hurricane ravaged citys economy saying a bold move was needed to restore lost tax revenue
5023091 under nagins proposal a u shaped section encompassing several blocks of the citys downtown area would allow large hotels to covert part of their property into las vegas style casinos
5023092 in the aftermath of hurricane katrina through a hastily arranged deal with carnival cruise lines 236 million from u s taxpayers will flow to a tax exempt israeli founded corporation registered in panama
5023093 the deal reached on sept 2 2005 will pay carnival some 236 million for the use of 7 100 berths for six months this means that each berth will cost u s taxpayers 5 540 per month or more than 184 per night the cost per bed can actually be much higher because not all berths will be occupied for the entire 6 month period of the contract
5023094 usa today reported that most evacuees rejected the offer to stay on the carnival ships
5023095 carnival corp was started by the ted arison an israeli veteran of the 1948 war in palestine who came to the united states in the early 1950s as did michael chertoffs mother livia eisen in 1990 arison returned to israel and turned control of carnival corp over to his son micky

5023100 the largest group of people who bought it were classic cnc fans
5023101 if it didnt have the c amp c tag peoples expectations would have been different there wouldnt have been a lot of controversy and people would have appreciated the game for what it is rather then compared it to other cnc games
5023102 i hate generals coz its called c amp c and it aint no c amp c

5023107 the china team had a very good performance but i think they suffered from high stress and pressure to win

5023110 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go

5023112 its great to be one of the top two in the world
5023113 i was lying in bed when peter phoned me and asked if i could ride

5023124 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
5023125 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
5023126 i came over in march which was just just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
5023127 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading center for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
5023128 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
5023129 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
5023130 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
5023131 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
5023132 tu non fare il lamento non piangere non versare una lacrima sospira in silenzio e non fare il lutto dei morti avvolgiti il capo con
5023133 its very surprising that the unemployment level continues to decline even when the economic indicators are unfavorable
5023134 that which is slowing denmarks economic growth is the labor shortage
5023135 its very surprising that the unemployment level continues to decline even when the economic indicators are unfavorable a housing market under pressure high inflation and weak growth
5023136 a strong international economic cycle the flexibility of the labor market and a series of reforms that required the jobless to end their dependency on benefits have all largely contributed to this success
5023137 bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery
5023138 i was faced witht he challenge of making a great speech up here and thought that i have no idea what to say so i did what most people would do i hit the internet
5023139 after a few days i figured i had better get off of those sites and start to really do some research
5023140 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5023141 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5023142 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
5023143 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
5023144 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
5023145 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
5023146 it will be well into 2009 before the market works off all the excesses accumulated during the housing boom
5023147 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
5023148 it competes with charles de gaulle in paris it competes with dubai now and with schipol in amsterdam because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with the competition
5023149 i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up
5023150 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time monopolies do not help consumers ever it was almost as if baa had won the lottery without doing anything they have been in a position where essentially they could control how we travel
5023151 it may make sense because airlines know how to deliver to consumers
5023152 for this movie to do what it did in 30 days is truly amazing
5023153 this movie continues knocking down records left and right and its unparalleled in movie history

5023363 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
5023364 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
5023365 you feel terry will give 100 whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
5023366 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 in his game by being captain
5023367 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays
5023368 he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
5023369 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
5023370 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to croatia
5023371 this time lets not be intimidated by the opposition and play two strikers
5023372 for that to work in qualification it has to be tried against the czechs
5023373 if wayne rooney is still not 100 because of his virus maybe peter crouch and jermain defoe should be given a chance as club mates at portsmouth
5023374 i dont know what the situation is with rooney but id like to see him at the england team hotel for some of the time even if he isnt needed to play
5023375 not ill tell you without asking my master is the great rich capulet and if you be of the house of montagues ill pray come

5023378 an inconvenient truth he said that the atmosphere gets thicker therefore the heat of the sun is trapped on earth but then the ozone layer is getting thinner i just dont understand the concept of the greenhouse gases compared to the concept of the ozone layer
5023379 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5023380 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance

5023383 he was a scarecrow quarterback before he caught the boxing bug
5023384 he soon gained a reputation as a clever amateur boxer winning 32 of 38 bouts
5023385 he was the oldest of us four brothers eddie van rob and ray
5023386 he was outgoing and rough we were like the mark wahlberg movie four brothers it was an everyday thing that we fought among ourselves but out of the family if you messed with one of us you messed with all four of us
5023387 he didnt fear anyone and often boxed top rated fighters
5023388 eddie gave his all we were friends out of the ring
5023389 he lived a big life around baltimore people from canton greektown highlandtown and all the way to lansdowne in baltimore county loved him he was their guy
5023390 there was a time vankirk was considered as much a hell raiser out of the ring as in it recently married hes settled down and taken his training regimen more seriously
5023391 he was a nice person but if you got on his bad side watch out
5023392 he had a lot of ups and downs in his life
5023393 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5023394 laura and i are proud of you our family is proud of you but most importantly america is proud of you

5023396 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5023397 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5023398 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5023399 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5023400 canadians are working under the policy of america it is a big mistake

5023403 the colorado river compact allocates 7 5 million acre feet of water to california nevada and mccains home state of arizona anything leftover is split between colorado utah new mexico and wyoming
5023404 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
5023405 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue

5023420 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
5023421 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
5023422 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information

5023424 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease

5023435 alchemy of trading is a bit different from those weve reviewed before although stephen vita posts plenty of breaking market news and related charts vita who has an mba and has been trading professionally for 15 years presents a stream of consciousness in his multiple daily posts also shares commentary on his own portfolio and trades a better tool for experienced investors who can blend this conversation in with their own studied experience

5023447 wait and see how he is going to react when he gets fired by abc news without a reason just because he is skinny like a monkey
5023448 the reason for firing was that theyre changing formats which they didnt really
5023449 weve been there loyal with the company and they didnt change the music a lot
5023450 a company shouldnt be able to say a 36 year old fellow would do it better than the 52 year old fellow
5023451 ive fired several disc jockeys we are in a business of change many people on the radio station who have worked there 15 20 years dont fit there anymore they might not sound age wise proper theres ethics here but then theres reality

5023464 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5023465 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5023466 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5023467 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5023468 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5023469 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5023470 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5023471 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5023474 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5023475 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5023479 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5023480 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5023481 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5023482 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5023483 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5023484 there were two classes of men whom society keep inexorably at arms length those who prey upon it and those who protect it

5023510 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5023511 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5023512 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5023513 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5023514 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little picnic at the frontier culture museum
5023515 i can tell you this ive been running for office for the past 21 years i spent 10 years of the house of delegates and i represented part of augusta county ive never in my life seen a crowd like this in augusta county
5023516 i know in the valley sometimes its challenging for democrats but i think theres going to be a lot of independents and republicans who rally to our cause in this campaign
5023517 im proud to be a virginia democrat because its a new breed of democrat people like a mark warner these fiscally conservative business minded democrats who believe that government has a role but at the same time we need to be able to balance a budget these are the types of democrats that brought me into this proud party
5023518 this race to us comes down to a very very simple choice we can either continue for the next four years the past eight years or we can make a change im not talking about change for change sake im talking about middle class families who are struggling right now to afford health care folks right now who because of the price of gas are struggling to make their commute people are really really hurting in this economy
5023519 weve already seen what the other side is going to do theyre going to play commercials with britney spears and paris hilton to try to make this election about something completely different from what it is sen obama was absolutely correct when he asked john mccain is that the best youve got
5023520 this election is too important to get sidetracked on silly issues when we have so many important things to discuss and debate with your help when other issues like that come up youre going to spend five minutes talking to your neighbor talking to your friend talking about barack obama and given your testimony why they should come on board and support barack obama
5023521 there is something going on not just in america at large not just in virginia at large but in the valley
5023522 theyre tired of paying 4 a gallon for gasoline theyre tired of the engagement in the middle east that doesnt seem to have a whole lot of purpose theyre tired of an economy that sends tens of thousands of jobs overseas theyre tired of the uncertainty in our markets right now that have created foreclosure crises all over virginia and all over this country its time to restore hope its time to restore promise its time to restore opportunity
5023523 brava sara hai fatto la brava stasera nessuna figura di merda
5023524 ik klaag niet de vrijheid van meningsuiting aan ik beklaag alleen de domoren die geloven dat deze vrijheid een exprestrein is die naar de waarheid leidt zoals wij niet willen dat mensen zich ontlasten op de openbare weg zoals wij zelfs de eigenaars van honden beleefd verzoeken de excrementen van hun huisdier op te ruimen zo zouden wij ook niet moeten toestaan dat een willekeurige geesteszieke op een willekeurige straathoek het verbale equivalent van kak mag verspreiden van zachte kak nog wel en dat vind ik de smerigste

5023526 these movies would still be more successful if they were toned down and rated pg 13 since more people would be able to get in to see it
5023527 is it really i hate to always argue with some of chris statements but just because some trend was established years ago doesnt mean it wont change over time and obviously we as moviegoers have progressed the hollywood reporter article is generally more of a report from a
5023528 my guess would be that fandangos users tend to skew younger and more male than the general population
5023529 they are clinging to some glimmer of hope but are obviously distressed
5023530 ha so you shot off 36 exposures and got lucky once
5023531 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the lanch of the hope from irans space station
5023532 the second launch of the safir ambassador rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5023533 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5023534 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5023536 whos going to want to sit next to a stinky smelly river full of rubbish unfortunately most councils act in this similar manner how about doing what the community would really like to see and fix the yarras pollution problems
5023537 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5023538 honestly it was probably one of the easiest quarters of football i have ever played
5023539 will focus on new trends in the production of raw ingredients as well as the producers chefs and restaurateurs that embody this philosophy
5023540 as far as being negative though people should be reminded that both brad wall and roy romanow were acclaimed as leaders of their parties and went on to lead their parties to success
5023541 a framework for available operating models by creating a strong focus on consolidation and optimization of the shared service a move to function shared service can dramatically increase efficiency

5023543 the rbc band is gonna rock the seward county fair tonight at 8pm
5023544 er was niet veel nieuws maar de familie wil het eerst zelf verwerken dat is natuurlijk begrijpelijk
5023545 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5023546 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5023547 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5023548 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5023549 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5023550 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5023551 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5023552 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5023553 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5023554 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5023555 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5023556 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5023557 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5023558 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5023559 the rbc band will rock the seward county fair friday night at 8pm
5023560 the rbc band will rock the seward county fair this friday night at 8
5023561 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5023562 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5023563 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5023564 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5023565 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5023566 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5023567 the rbc band will rock the fair friday night at 8pm

5023571 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5023572 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire
5023573 have just this morning sunday announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5023574 this is the promise that the russian president has given to the french president i hope this time hell keep his word
5023575 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5023576 a roadside bomb struck a police vehicle there were 10 policemen in the car who were all killed
5023577 it was a dangerous gang which was trained in pakistan and was responsible for the killing of about 30 tribal chiefs in the past three or four years
5023578 offers up front and additional discounts if enough companies sign up
5023579 i actually just met a guy who does radio frequency identification
5023580 there are tons of companies in rochester too small to market so the best way to hear of them is to get out and meet people
5023581 not to promote the products and services they provide but about finding and growing their companies
5023582 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5023583 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
5023584 we want the palestinian people to understand that they can achieve far more for themselves through a process of dialogue through a process of negotiation through a process of reconciliation than the extremists can ever deliver for them
5023585 this government has blood on its hands because they release these murderers that will go tomorrow to do more terror attacks on israeli civilians and the blame will be on the government
5023586 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5023587 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5023588 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5023589 the canadian people when they express condolences for the death of two canadian women in logar in afghanistan and consider themselves grieved they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well
5023590 they said the formula is gone that it was already given away

5023604 we will be gone at the end of the year
5023605 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
5023606 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore
5023607 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
5023608 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course

5023612 we have some of the highest uv intensity in the world with drought and climate change finding ways to use water more efficiently is always important to us
5023613 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
5023614 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
5023615 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
5023616 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
5023617 now annalee told me that decor was very tacky and overdone there thats beautiful

5023628 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5023629 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
5023630 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record

5023634 we face a situation of economic stagnation and a steep slowdown
5023635 the government is working to make sure that the economy recovers as soon as possible
5023636 now weve made nine new life long friends thats the way it seems to be with our group
5023637 when you come to that line and you can hear the cheers especially when youre dead tired and can see all those maple leafs its fantastic
5023638 no one here has any problem arriving early in the pouring rain we would arrive 12 hours early if need be
5023639 the prime example is in britain where other parents are not happy when another child does well
5023640 a big part of that is the great support from the athletes and their families
5023641 an example would be the ice sheets if they once begin to collapse and slide into the ocean then its too late you cant reduce co2 and hope that youre going to stop them because its out of your control at that point and unfortunately we are almost certainly going to lose all of the ice in the arctic ocean
5023642 as you begin to melt the arctic sea ice it exposes darker ocean absorbs more sunlight and melts more ice
5023643 if we had put a carbon price a gradually increasing carbon price then the gasoline would probably be costing you 4 a gallon now but you would have vehicles that use half as much or less
5023644 that money should be given back 100 percent to the taxpayers on a per capita basis so the person who does better than average in terms of conserving his energy use and carbon emissions would actually gain money
5023645 what is really marvelous about the youth is theyre inclusive theyre not political they see this as a common issue and that i think is one of their biggest strengths they include both sides
5023646 the climate affects all of us we all live on this planet so its not a partisan issue at all i think its just a question of the timing are we going to invest the money to do it and the time is now our environment is getting in more critical condition
5023647 just because when we put our mind to it weve always accomplished what we need to accomplish this is an emergency and we need to focus all our energies on it
5023648 from our interactions in the community right now theres not a lot of support for the project so its not like this is some renegade type of effort this is really reflective of what a lot of people are feeling right now and i think a lot of it is justified when you think about the fact that that under the current plans people are losing access to transit
5023649 right now theres not a lot of support for the project
5023650 these concerns are absolutely understandable they happen in every community in which light rail is but at the end of the day light rail represents a huge investment in these communities so our commitment is that these issues as they are identified we will work through them
5023651 i was one of those community members who was saying id like to be able to cross my street
5023652 where i think it broke down was no one said here are your alternatives we can lose street parking which could have serious impacts on small businesses or restore pedestrian crossings which one is more important to you but rather we got the response well you told us to fix this problem so we fixed it what are you complaining about well we needed to be engaged in that solution not just be told what it is
5023653 i think its to the point now where theyre going to build the thing no matter what happens the train has left the station and its steaming down the tracks full speed and youre not going to stop it
5023654 on a case by case basis were working here and there to see what can be done but weve already gone through a lot of hearings i dont think wed ever move forward on any aspect on any project if you had to have 100 percent agreement on something and this may be one of those issues
5023655 in relation to the inclusion of elements from the older form of the roman liturgy when celebrating the newer form
5023656 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god
5023657 how does it make you feel do you enjoy it does it touch something in you then it is a great work of art
5023658 this one is flowers and flowers make me happy that one is a dude screaming and screams make me sad
5023659 a diet of nothing but classics is just as damaging as a diet of pop culture
5023660 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5023661 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5023662 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5023663 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5023664 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5023665 it is extremely worrying that last month malta had the highest inflation increase in the euro zone this actually means that the spending power of maltese salaries is being contnuously eroded with certain categories of workers not making it till the end of the month on their salaries
5023666 to begin with ad believes that government should seriously consider realistic compenstation for cost of living increases an increase in the minimum wage and in tax credits
5023667 ad believes that the government should not remain idle against inflation to the contrary we are proposing the strengthening of fair trading office so that it can take action against cartels and abusive practices government should also encourage increased production of commodities such as agricultural products and incentivise local markets to avoid artificial price increases by middlemen government should also make life easier for small and medium enterprises whilst avoiding extra costs resulting from bureaucracy and communications
5023668 during five years we were victims of the general violence in iraq but mainly from violence carried by islamic extremists who want us to follow their religious behaviors though we are from a different culture and belief
5023669 the idea to form militias was the only way to protect our families and friends from attacks because we are tired of waiting an action from the government which is preoccupied with politics and never look after us
5023670 i want to walk wearing what i want and eating when i want
5023671 during years we lived in peace in this land where i was born all muslims were happy to be part of our lives share our thoughts and respect our decisions
5023672 today we are seen as prostitutes for not wearing traditional clothes our husbands killed for not fasting or wearing shorts our children out from schools and colleges for security reasons and even our churches closed after constant attacks and threats
5023673 if they dont want to respect us for being human beings now they will have to esteem us because we can be as tough as they are to protect our loved ones
5023674 we didnt have a choice we cannot wait for an extremist to come and kill dozens just because we want to live according to our beliefs
5023675 sometimes it is better to close your eyes towards some facts because although it seams illegal it can save many lives
5023676 our new militias are the start of a possible new life for christians in iraq
5023677 unfortunately some people here today just respect others if they feel they can fight them with the same weapons and now we started and hope it can change our sad reality
5023678 we will have more chance to stand up and survive among the ongoing violence if we fight face to face and protect ourselves from attackers
5023679 some dignitaries have arrived here to mediate a saudi royal air force plane is parked at chaklala air base so the matter could be a day or two
5023680 a line has been drawn between democracy and dictatorship its a decisive moment so obviously i want to be on this side of the line
5023681 the draft has been given a final shape and by tomorrow or the day after itll be presented to the coalition leadership and hopefully an impeachment motion with charge sheet will be moved this week
5023682 i was able to imagine what a bat would think if it were a bat
5023683 it will not help to try to imagine that one has webbing on ones arms and that one spends the day hanging upside down by ones feet in an attic in so far as i can imagine this it tells me only what it would be like for me to behave as a bat behaves but that is not the question i want to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat
5023684 what would make a really large bright blip a wall of input to this bat
5023685 we used to watch our dad having a great time with his friends playing jazz at the house

5023704 and sad to say the concept of sin among many conservative christians has been essentially
5023705 pg 22 it is not a pretty picture of the church or of individual believers that is painted in this chapter
5023706 the acceptable sins are subtle in the sense that they deceive us into thinking they are not so bad or not thinking of them as sins or even worse not thinking of them at all
5023707 this means that all of our rebellion all of our despising of god and his law all of our grieving his holy spirit all of our presuming on his grace all of our sin is done openly in the very presence of god its as if we are acting out all of our sins before him as he sits on his royal throne
5023708 you are not as bad as you think you are you are worse
5023709 weve had one called zac a border collie who starts singing when he hears happy birthday and another called hollywood who sings along to hooray for hollywood

5023711 dogs sing together instinctively as part of a pack their sense of community
5023712 in swansea there are so many breeds with different characters and voices and all have a relationship like us with the place in which they live
5023713 i felt it a fitting homage to swansea jack whose instinct was to be a hero it is also about fun a celebration
5023714 we are going into the recording studio on 8 september and then the performance is a one off at the national waterfront museum in swansea on 5 october
5023715 when he would do something really good we would sing hooray for hollywood and he would join in
5023716 i would be over the moon for him if he got into the choir because he has a lovely nature
5023717 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it ive been dreaming about this moment since i was eight years old
5023718 having three russian girls left standing in the olympics is a huge moment for russia

5023740 urge my fellow practitioners to run not walk to purchase this remarkable new textbook
5023741 you just cant let it get to you there are other things way more important
5023742 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was i call it a freak of nature
5023743 we are in an era of opportunity for the city
5023744 weve invested in buildings weve invested in workforce but we havent invested in a way to connect all the investments
5023745 were talking about something that will allow us to remain competitive and thats why im for it
5023746 more revolves around economic development than it does around transit
5023747 its essentially a moving sidewalk a pleasurable experience it absolutely will attract more people downtown
5023748 streetcars will help to stimulate development because it will be operating 18 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year
5023749 that means more jobs more investment and helping to stabilize several of our neighborhoods
5023750 we invested 40 million plus in the convention center 40 million plus in fountain square and were talking about a 600 800 million dollar development on the waterfront
5023751 the streetcar has come out to be the number one issue that we all can agree is going to be a critical component to the future growth of this neighborhood
5023752 we fully understand that its critical to connect downtown with uptown
5023753 everyone else needs to understand that over the rhine is that connector
5023754 show that young professionals who become tomorrows ceos are choosing place over job
5023755 the global economy were trying to find our place in that
5023756 will the streetcar be the thing that does it no but its a great step in a direction to start this conversation
5023757 cincinnati used to compare itself to london to paris to vienna
5023758 somehow in the last twenty to thirty years we started comparing ourselves to indianapolis and lexington and pittsburgh if we frame this conversation in terms of where we fit relative to other cities our size weve already lost
5023759 the greenest and most environmentally sustainable region in the country
5023760 we will fare better than previous plans because were doing something thats never before been done in cincinnati modeling after northern kentucky
5023761 we have established genuine friendships with the leaders of vision 2015 a common purpose will undoubtedly yield increasing levels of collaboration in the future
5023762 we recognize that our long term success will be determined by our ability to keep working together for the greater good
5023763 the only people who see the river as a barrier are governments and newspapers
5023764 vision 2015 nailed it when they filled their leadership posts with intergenerational volunteers says maly who believes cincinnati is ahead of the nation in this regard they and ultimately agenda 360 leaders understood that in order to compete for the best and brightest a young professional initiative here and there doesnt even come close to cutting it this is the key difference between vision 2015 agenda 360 and past visioning efforts
5023765 we chose not to do as weve always done and as a result were not getting what weve always gotten
5023766 going into the second half i thought i could do it
5023767 i want to prove to the people i can race very well for this age
5023768 i was pushing very hard and wanted my gold medal
5023769 i came here to compete and im glad that i have done my best
5023770 i couldnt stand it i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
5023771 federal and local authorities are girding for huge protests mammoth traffic tie ups and civil disturbances
5023772 the city said they couldnt disclose information because the secret service wouldnt tell the city their plans but once we filed suit suddenly the started releasing information then the second phase of the suit was to challenge the constitutionality of the security arrangements which the judge of course upheld
5023773 mark cohen testified that the security conditions around the dnc will make demonstrators look like animals in a cage and that the delegates wont hear them he also said that the public demonstration zone is blocked by a media tent and other structures that limit sight and sound access to the delegates it is not the image of fellow citizens but rather prisoners in a cage with no clear connection to the purpose of their being there cohen said
5023774 before the trial started members of recreate 68 staged a quiet protest outside the u s district courthouse against the secret service and the city while wearing orange jail jumpsuits with the words dissent is not a crime yet they also placed silver duct tape over their mouths
5023775 we are going to file our appeal in the street
5023776 learned that a manufacturer of pepper ball guns had earned a contract with the city because the information was posted on the manufacturers website but the city has refused to say whether the purchase was made
5023777 reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
5023778 they hate our freedoms gee george w was right after all whoops wrong country
5023779 if an organization were to plan to hold hundreds of dogs in those cages the humane society would have to get involved
5023780 the center will have air conditioning water restrooms and medical staff as well as telephones for detainees to reach family and attorneys
5023781 colorado law requires that confidential attorney visits be accommodated at the temporary detention facility as well
5023782 the secret service the pentagon the federal bureau of investigation and scores of police departments are moving thousands of agents analysts officers and employees to denver for the aug 25 28 convention they will operate through a complex hierarchy of command centers steering committees and protocols to respond to disruptions the denver police department will nearly double in size according to federal officials involved in the planning the city is bringing in nearly 1 500 police officers from communities throughout colorado and beyond even inviting an eight person mounted unit from cheyenne wy
5023783 ignoring a city prohibition against the collection of first amendment related intelligence the denver police developed files on 208 organizations and 3 200 individuals the department appears to have continued its surveillance until the fall of 2002 despite the aclu lawsuit monitored groups included the american friends service committee a pacifist quaker group amnesty international and many others with no history of criminal activity documents obtained by the aclu describe how police intercepted e mails recorded the license plate numbers of vehicles at demonstrations and infiltrated advocacy group meetings
5023784 federal and state law enforcement officials in colorado plan to increase intelligence operations during the democratic national convention in denver and run a fusion center where intelligence analysts will collect and analyze reports of suspicious activity civil rights advocates fear the fusion center could enable unwarranted spying on protesters exercising their first amendment rights at the convention
5023785 these centers have very robust police powers and domestic intelligence collecting powers and what weve seen in the past is that when police agencies are given secret powers to spy they abuse those powers and where there is very unclear line of accountability the chances of something bad happening under that system were very high
5023786 meant to facilitate communications between federal state and local law enforcement agencies to share information about quote unquote suspicious activities which can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad when its defined by them
5023787 one of the precursor behaviors to terrorism thats identified in the order is taking video and we put in our report a couple of instances where people taking video were stopped by police officers simply for taking pictures or video and in some cases particularly where theyre taking photographs or video of police it actually resulted in arrests
5023788 watch them almost break all of the rules and get down and dirty order now and get your free at amp t telecom immunity tote bag
5023789 i cant even describe the nervousness and the fear of that last 50 meters my best analogy was if youre walking down the street and you turn down a dark alley and all of a sudden someone steps out of the shadows and pulls a knife or a gun youre in complete fear of your life then all of a sudden they rip their mask off and its your long lost buddy and hes like psyche thats what i went through
5023790 i dont think we ever expected her to reach this level
5023791 we knew she could be doing better than what she was doing but i dont think we saw her running as a true way to make a living and being big time and running in all of these european meets and going to the olympics were as surprised as anybody else to hear that someone who wasnt that good in high school and wasnt a star in college is now at the world class level
5023792 a lot of the competitors i race against they were really good high school and college caliber athletes some of them went pro right out of high school for me i had the opposite i had to learn how to be a better athlete and work harder and figure out my race strategy so i could hang with my competitors i learned how to do that
5023793 people actually knew who mary wineberg is i think people realized im not the same runner as i was three or four years ago when i was average mentally and physically i was stronger i was not afraid to be running against my competitors i saw myself as one of the best runners in the world it was really an interesting year it opened my eyes to so many different things
5023794 when i crossed the line on that night it was kind of unbelievable and i was in shock
5023795 but ive trained for four long years ive had some ups and some downs i knew going into this year that my times proved i could do it i just had to believe in myself even though i ran the wrong race i was still able to make the team
5023796 i bottled a couple bottles of the water from there and i brought it all the way over here sprinkled a little bit on everybodys fingers and legs i mean im not superstitious or anything i think the key was hard work but it might have helped a little bit
5023797 thats what we kind of envisioned during the first part of the race where we just wanted to think about us for what we could do i made a call for the 1984 girls and were gonna do them proud and we just started motoring to the finish line
5023798 the first thing you want to do is jump out of the boat and jump out of your skin but you dont have enough energy left to do it
5023799 we kept trying really hard until the end and it feels great
5023800 but theyve just able to focus on what they need to do theyre very professional but the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear they came down smiling to the boat house which was a good sign
5023801 we were streamlined we just looked straight ahead i cant really remember any other boats out there to be honest because it was all about how fast we could go it was the most beautiful peace
5023802 our goal was to not lose any ground we just wanted to row our race and we did we got faster every 500 it felt like we got faster but i dont know it got harder every 500 put it that way
5023803 and i just started smiling everybody smiled because this was a sweet rhythm and it just gives them confidence i mean i was almost having to be the calming aspect because they were ramping it up and we just needed to let that hunter go and just force that rhythm and just let that rhythm go and it was nice
5023804 thats the great thing about being in that bow seat you can see everybody ahead of you and if they were making a move gosh dang it im gonna make a move harder than that so it was fun it was fun being back there watching all that unfold we saw romania push we saw netherlands push but i think we had an answer
5023805 i think this medal is more his than mine i think its all my familys its not my medal i think i share it with a lot of people
5023806 hyde park has imperceptible evolution it is what it was and it is what it is its always evolving but at a hyde park pace it always seems to fit in
5023807 a landmark piece of architecture once complete i have every confidence that it will patina into the community and feel very much a part of it even in its uniqueness
5023808 they want that lifestyle but they dont want to leave the great state of 45208
5023809 its diverse it can be if you choose to live in an expensive home but there are reasonable places to live as well part of the charm is its not an exclusive enclave but an inclusive enclave it has a great mixture of architecture which makes it so charming and livable
5023810 there is not one chain store not a duplicated item of merchandise hyde park is one hundred percent unique were a place not a mall in addition to the merchant mix we have on going events that make us a great place to commune with friends family and neighbors having that sense of an extended family is pretty magical considering we live in a big city
5023811 every city there has that one special neighborhood that has an indescribable karma you just feel it when youre there and we happen to be that one special place in our city that has no equal
5023812 mopeds aesthetic its marginalized status in our society the friendly traveling easy stop communication and our ability to enjoy the trip as well as the destination
5023813 being a scooterist is a way of life it takes a different kind of mentality to take a 20 40 year old machine and use it everyday for transportation
5023814 most of us in the xyl group are into the restoration and mechanical aspect of our machines we like the fact that they require constant maintenance
5023815 there is never an end to fixing tuning and customizing these things its all part of the deal
5023816 way to stay in contact with the friends ive made in other branches its pretty amazing to go to another city and feel like you have a built in group of people who you already have a lot in common with and youve already built a relationship with via online forums and rallies its a bonding experience
5023817 my intent for the blog started out as mostly a way for me to spout off my ideas and vent at the poor local media of 2002 i started out mostly covering politics but we have evolved into a vehicle to spread the word out about the great places and events happening in the urban core most people in cincinnati want to get in touch with the vibrancy that exists in downtown otr and the surrounding neighborhoods but they dont know how because the local media far too often falls back upon 60 year old faux philosophy that success is only found outside of an urban setting
5023818 they may learn to hate every idea i write about but they are participating in the local community by reading my blog
5023819 the blog got started as a way for me to demonstrate my opinion on industry topics while keeping my technical and writing skills honed
5023820 cincinnatis best kept secret is its pride we are way too down on ourselves for example seven years after the riots we should be celebrating the return of the naacp convention and not using it as an opportunity to rehash the riots that said i love cincinnatis character and blogs like building cincinnati and make cincinnati weird remind me of how great our city is when others seem to forget
5023821 we decided to set it up because if you read the local blogs it seems to me the most interesting reading youll find about the city its really sort of a greedy thing we wanted to meet these people face to face because they seem so interesting
5023822 this is a chance to put a face to a name and to make sure everybodys on everybodys list so no one misses any of the interesting ideas that are being kicked around
5023823 i think it may even become an annual event who knows we just sort of made it up
5023824 what we strive to do is create jobs and when these conventions come here those dollars go to restaurants to retail shopping attractions to museums we infuse our economy with fresh dollars
5023825 2001 was a wake up call for cincinnati and it spoke clearly to disparities that exist between african americans and whites in this region
5023826 its taken regional leadership civic groups and city government to all agree that diversity and inclusion is an important part of a vibrant city
5023827 i think the city has come together its come full circle i think people realize this is a multicultural city we all live here and have to make this a better place
5023828 we were honest about our problems and are working to fix these issues
5023829 were playing to the mission of lulac it is weaker in this area lulac has been in dallas and orlando very many times
5023830 we might help the cause by focusing on this area
5023831 we have not seen in recent history this level of cooperation between public officials community based organizations and corporations weve never experienced working together like this in enhancing the citys image its resulted in a level collaboration i havent seen in a long time hopefully its set the framework for how we do this again and again
5023832 he joined filibusters to stop the constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage the bill to limit medical malpractice lawsuits and several judicial nominees he joined almost all other democrats in rejecting individual retirement accounts in social security he took a harder line stance on trade he voted not just against samuel alito but also against john roberts
5023833 we need to balance two critical things cool and feasible
5023834 the laws of physics say you cant do what were doing in one weekend
5023835 net every day and the 10 percent who use it to share their personal media
5023836 what we hope to build is a community of 100 people who go through a common experience of starting a company that six months from now we can have multiple companies
5023837 theres a tremendous amount of talent here that we need to unleash
5023838 es algo ins lito algo tremendo para una ciudad de 40 000 habitantes
5023839 la gente ha vibrado han venido de todas partes a ver el partido y todos se han emocionado
5023840 hoy es un d a grande no s lo para manacor para mallorca o para baleares sino para todo el pa s
5023841 this is our opportunity to show how our city has changed over the last five years
5023842 we are a microcosm of the rest of the country
5023843 we brought everyone into one room on this one there are a lot of people who genuinely want to progress this city everyone im working with is passionate about making cincinnati better as well as showing we are a metropolitan player
5023844 we know there are still issues that need to be worked on and we think we can help make a difference by being here to share our vision and to get people to understand how talking together and understanding each other will more likely lead to a real resolution
5023845 this years convention is a culmination and celebration of all the naacp represents
5023846 the conventions offerings underscore that the naacp has a place for everyone and every lifestyle
5023847 we had no ethnic meetings between 2001 and 2004 but a lot of work has been done by a lot of individuals and a lot of organizations
5023848 this is our opportunity to showcase our city if we can change cincinnati we can change the nation we can make room for a different kind of conversation
5023849 at studio endure we want to be the custom place if you want something different one of a kind thats where you go
5023850 the whole sneaker collecting thing is popular outside the us
5023851 youve got releases that only come out in europe only come out in asia people are combing the globe trying to find them
5023852 ive always been the kid in the class drawing god blesses us with talents and gifts i draw i paint i create
5023853 i was getting enough business that i had my moms basement full of peoples shoes
5023854 we decked out some shoes put them in the window and next thing you know we were running orders for custom shoes
5023855 the skys the limit i just did a portrait t shirt it was easily 120
5023856 ive outfitted entire nightclubs ive done theme rooms in peoples homes a few local art shows
5023857 this isnt just a black thing this isnt just a hood thing this isnt just a rap thing
5023858 i have a community focus i want to give back and actually create jobs and teach people
5023859 youve got knuckleheads in every neighborhood whether theyre knocking over mailboxes or knocking out people
5023860 its our first competition so im a little bit nervous
5023861 we look forward to showing them what were doing down here in cincinnati
5023862 i dont think i really have competition because im that good
5023863 we survived record theater media play circuit city peaches target and wal mart all in our backyard
5023864 almost everyday it seems some kid gets a laugh out of the pop up band members when you open jethro tulls stand up
5023865 my theory is it is a bit of technological backlash a reaction to nebulous mp3s that dont really exist
5023866 the idea of having a tangible object is very important
5023867 a lot of kids input the turntables right into their computer and burn the stuff to their i pods you can get an old led zeppelin album for 5 it might cost 8 12 to download it and kids say burning a record has a better warmer sound quality than if it was downloaded
5023868 i remember kids would come in to the store and wonder what that big cd was and where do you find a cd player that big
5023869 we would get boxes of each artist and they would sell out in one day
5023870 this is how we think of our country a nation of 50 states but its essentially become a network of metro areas and unless these places are healthy and vital our ability to compete globally is at risk
5023871 most of our customers shop for our product by phone and i wanted to make a good impression
5023872 number one you dont want someone to get a busy signal and i didnt want the person answering the phone to be the reservations clerk the driver a maintenance guy or the owner because that gives the wrong impression
5023873 how many businesses have you called and the receptionist was nasty or sounded like a moron nobody wants to pay a receptionist
5023874 especially when you first open a business its like a pack of hyenas on a dead carcass in the savannah
5023875 call em up they need credit card services they need a postage meter they need a copier they need furniture and they drive you out of your mind intelligent office will screen all of those calls for you and theyll deal with the headache of telling people to go away to me thats worth it right there
5023876 when were working with clients in coaching sessions we have our clients turn their phones and blackberries off
5023877 we turn ours off so were unavailable period its great to have mary paula and nicole to be able to answer the phones for us so that our clients have someone live to speak with that adds to our professionalism
5023878 we pay for the office space that we use rather than creating a long term lease which would reduce our profit margins
5023879 part of the attraction of our virtual packages is that we do put on that united front
5023880 maybe in the future it will make sense to hire a full time receptionist but right now its just more cost efficient to do this
5023881 this city has an interesting story around brand building and we can support it
5023882 its the most interesting creative class story in the city
5023883 who would think that type of thinking would come from a city in the heartland
5023884 todays opera companies have to play the middle ground between innovation and audience expectations
5023885 we the marketing department are responsible for communicating the voice of the company through research
5023886 but it works because it plays just below what people think about opera it taps into what we want in an emotional experience
5023887 as a marketing director milligan is an artistic directors dream because he understands the artistic merits of the art while providing his best advice backed up by research and how it will work he will agonize over the smallest subtleties but they make a difference they make people feel involved at music hall
5023888 chris starts with the idea that everyone in this company is a smart person this is not at all common in an opera company to have an open door policy for marketing
5023889 unlike some arts institutions we are not a refuge from people who cant perform we create an office environment that hopefully breeds creativity
5023890 no one wins for having the best idea rather we all have good ideas that we build into practical executions that help us to see the opera differently
5023891 im not ashamed to tell you i subscribe to vogue
5023892 one of my favorite ways to stay current for web based content is to visit which has the top 20 web videos that are featured on various blogs
5023893 opera produced at the level that we produce can be transformative it can touch an emotional core in an immediate and unexpected way
5023894 what keeps me coming back to madame butterfly is that it breaks my heart every time it makes me ultimately appreciate the people in my life and whats important to me people see opera and think everyone dies its so depressing but i see the opposite effect it reminds you that life is precious its a message about life its a message about how to live life and to cherish those things that are important to you
5023895 if its on the truck more than four hours its not local
5023896 if we dont make it easier for our farmers to farm theyll stop farming and the land will be developed
5023897 every dollar spent on local food generates twice as much economic impact the money tends to stay in the local economy longer
5023898 the idea is to have healthy soil not just dirt our soil is as alive as any ecosystem
5023899 atricure is making a tremendous impact on peoples lives through developing technology to treat the worlds most common heart irregularity
5023900 we can replicate the only surgical procedure for af thats been shown to have high success rates
5023901 we can penetrate this large unmet need of more than 2 5 million americans
5023902 as recently as 2000 we were a north american company focused on the telecommunications industry
5023903 their products are key to the industrialization of third world developing economies
5023904 youll want to do as good a job on the dissertation as you can so youll have less work to do when you turn it into a book
5023905 people that wouldnt necessarily spend 60 or 70 on a theatre ticket will spend 10 at the fringe to try it out
5023906 i love it when i hear other fringe artists telling their colleagues back home what a great time they had here in cincinnati were getting a bit of a reputation as a cool place to fringe
5023907 the fringe festival sounded more interesting than what we were looking at in chicago so we made a detour to check it out we ended up staying here the whole week
5023908 this project will bring the art out of the galleries and to the public
5023909 it will be something for all of cincinnati to be proud of
5023910 if we had been smart we would have opened by the mall
5023911 we wouldnt have done it if we realized how hard it is
5023912 we just decided that if we got to the end of our lives and we didnt do this it would be something we wish we had
5023913 its kind of hypocritical to say were doing something great for the local community but be ignorant to whats happening in communities where the coffees being grown
5023914 we may not be known as a huge coffee city
5023915 but the style of places that are opening is hugely unique
5023916 as long as it benefits this community well pay for it
5023917 basically the first friday of every month 6 9 p m participating businesses will have committed to be open during those hours waam is to unite any business in newport that features an artist has artwork hanging a book signing musicians or anything to do with the arts we also have theaters within two blocks so actors seemed to be a good fit and also another form of art that i think gets overlooked sometimes it tries to encompass all of the arts and offers extended hours for people who may not be able to make it to these places during normal business hours
5023918 the other events final friday second saturday they are fantastic events all of them but they are pretty much galleries we have two theaters and not movies that youre going to watch theyre actual plays put on by local organizations and you can walk around the corner to the southgate house where they have cd release parties and local bands all the time so its different in the sense that theres a lot more to offer in newport as far as diversity of the arts
5023919 with us trying to promote people who are taking risks with their art galleries and museums sometimes can tend to exclude people and be kind of stuffy thats what i think is good about this event theres so much and its such a down to earth kind of event if you want to see a punk rock band you can go down the street to the southgate house and then come up here on the same night and see something that would be considered fine art i think its just a broad spectrum of stuff no fan of any of these things is left out because theres so much for everybody
5023920 you might find at york street for instance a new show in the gallery upstairs and a band on the second level
5023921 traditional conceptions of language bound within the strict confines of grammar and the connotation of socially indoctrinated meanings completely turned inside out
5023922 the gallery didnt have to represent a specific type of art it wouldnt pigeonhole us
5023923 our mission is to support local art and original art theres so much stuff you can buy at target and walmart prints you can buy to decorate your home we want to stay focused on the local artists and to support any way we can the individuals around
5023924 we want to give artists that first exposure they need which a lot of galleries wont give them i feel we are set apart by that
5023925 yep what youre doing this search into who you really are and the full exploration of the extent and effects of your trauma is very difficult most people will go their entire lives just making do because its easier that actually facing and owning their shit not knowing where you will end up once you face your full truth can be a very intimidating and scary thing and yes it is a very lonely path at times

5023928 an amazing spectacle of profound significance to the world which however you regard national socialism must provoke reflections impossible to be ignored
5023929 the worst day there will ever be in their life
5023930 they anticipate a storm coming in tonight dropping another foot of snow
5023931 were just doing route searches along what could be their route were also processing cell phone data and radar data
5023932 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future and i wouldnt mind missing one or two tests
5023933 actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there is not one that i dont like
5023934 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed

5023937 youd better make sure the boys wash their hair tonight
5023938 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5
5023939 i couldnt have picked a better person to catch it from
5023940 hes really the most legendary player in the nfl right now i cant really explain the feeling
5023941 were going to have to get him to chip in with some of whatever hes getting from the jets to get us some new gloves
5023942 they gave us the looks we practiced pretty much all week because of that i think i was a step up on what they were doing in the game
5023943 but every time he has a performance like that it definitely opens some more opportunities
5023944 when they came out on that play he split out very wide so i figured they were going to do something with him
5023945 im sure they read about the 40 times and things like that coming out of the combine
5023946 but were playing football now its all about positioning i played my technique and got in good position in fact i think i should have caught it
5023947 im voting for senator mccain ill do what i can to help him ill do it as good governor we cut taxes were growing jobs lowest unemployment in 30 years but we have more work

5023956 many republican friends have contacted me and encouraged me to stand firm
5023957 the longer the present situation continues the more favorable for us i am regularly in touch with the nixon entourage
5023958 in the end though johnsons advisers decided it was too late and too potentially damaging to u s interests to uncover what had been going on
5023959 if nixon should emerge as the victor what would the chennault outrage do to his viability as an incoming president and what effect would it have on american opinion about the war
5023960 you couldnt surface it the country would be in terrible trouble

5023964 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5023965 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5023966 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5023967 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5023969 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5023970 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5023971 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5023972 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5023973 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5023974 i have come away with a clear idea about who i am and what i want from life i have a sense of purpose and a clear idea of what my next steps will be after a few weeks it now feels like i am moving in a much more positive direction and without the insecurities and fears that i have previously experienced

5023979 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5023980 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5023981 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5023982 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5023983 society demands that we succeed in this challenge that we end police corruption

5024068 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled

5024168 on this time scale climate could be dominated by internal variability arising from unforced natural changes in the climate system such as el ni o fluctuations in the thermohaline circulation and anomalies of ocean heat content

5024173 global climate models have been used to make predictions of climate change on decadal or longer time scales but these only accounted for projections of external forcing neglecting initial condition information needed to predict internal variability we examined the potential skill of decadal predictions using the newly developed decadal climate prediction system depresys based on the hadley centre coupled model version 3 hadcm3 a dynamical global climate model gcm depresys takes into account the observed state of the atmosphere and ocean in order to predict internal variability together with plausible changes in anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations and projected changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosol

5024187 always sisters becoming the princess you were created to be
5024188 when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
5024189 at first i thought it was funny and flattering but its tiresome now ive seen magazines where plastic surgeons are saying if you want a butt like this it has to be fake and im just like dude have you ever seen an armenian girl before
5024190 i think i finally made the right choice hes just a really sweet normal guy
5024191 im still in shock its like going to a yankee game and catching a foul ball hit by derek jeter
5024192 it had all the classics james brown aretha franklin michael jackson
5024193 wir haben allgemein den eindruck dass gypten nicht daran interessiert ist dass die hamas durch den handel gewinnt deshalb strengt es sich offenbar nicht besonders an um israel zu berreden unsere bedingungen f r den handel zu akzeptieren
5024194 we have a great relationship and theres no telling what will happen moving forward
5024195 theres no negative energy there now everybody feels positive we all feel connected
5024196 it feels really good in this economic climate for me as not only an artist but as a businessman to be able to present something to america that i know will make things a little easier for people
5024197 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
5024198 i dont think sticking so close to me is the best thing
5024199 all ive found out is that everyone in the world seems to be better looking that me
5024200 none of the girls have fancied me in here so how can i expect any of the women on the outside to like me

5024205 having three russian girls left standing in the olympics is a huge moment for russia
5024206 it was a very special and historic year and i want them to look back with pride when they look at the ring and remember the week to week approach

5024208 my quad man it was bad every week you get it better then you go out and play and hurt it again the quad would get weak i was taking those pills for the pain i was running around trying to make plays when its not there the quad is definitely back where it needs to be although i still have a little hole in there

5024232 i was mad but i know stuff like that happens its not like it was the mechanics fault but i thought for sure id lost the cup
5024233 i knew that if salom won i had to get fourth i was trying to think about it but not too much i didnt want to have my head full of a load of pressure going into the last race in the race i knew that he was ahead of me and i was trying to get past the guys around me but i also didnt want to crash the lap before it stopped the bike lost a bit of power but i didnt think too much of it then it just quit
5024234 i really had to push for it but i love this track and as its the last race of the season i didnt want to come away second
5024235 when matt caught me i followed him for a couple of laps and picked up a few lines i got back in front but i couldnt get away from him then i knew it would come down to the last lap i had the plan to pass him at the end of the front straight going onto the last lap and that is what i did
5024236 i knew that i was pretty good on the brakes into the last corners so i was happy to lead
5024237 he came past me up the inside into the last left hander but then ran wide i looked over and i knew that i could get him back at the right so i did
5024238 it was my last chance to win one and i just waited for him to brake and went later too late but at least i tried
5024239 what a weekend the crash yesterday and then third today third should be good but this wasnt good enough four wins this season but i wanted the cup

5024252 this is a wonderful day of course for the satmar community which is a largely represented by these new registrations but also for the greater williamsburg jewish community
5024253 i am positively delighted at the success of this non partisan voter registration drive under the auspices of rabbi david niederdman this is truly a great day for communities of north brooklyn and i congratulate the rabbi on his phenomenal success
5024254 this is tremendous day for all brooklyn communities in these tough economic times when resources are getting more and more scarce it is important for brooklyn to flex its muscles and show just by its sheer size alone that is has incredible strength in its communities this is a very great accomplishment for rabbi niederman ujo and the new voters who have just empowered themselves

5024257 looking at all the ways environmental issues affect a business can frame thinking and strategy in a new way by examining their business through an environmental lens managers can avoid expensive problems and create substantial value
5024258 examine the canon of green business the major business books articles and case studies that had discussed the business environment interface
5024259 everything they do in their value chain is aligned with their social value proposition not every company can build this in but every company can find a way to think about this strategically

5024262 there are well documented cases where western companies withdraw because of pressure from ngos and the follow up studies show how local populations may well end up in dire straits

5024264 the large company of today has reached the end of a defining period
5024265 superficiality fails whereas authenticity prevails companies that falsely approach corporate responsibility as a form of marketing pr or even philanthropy dont produce the most meaningful results in fact they often waste their money and create additional liabilities conversely companies that truly approach the practice of corporate responsibiity as a fully integrated business strategy wisely investing in profitable solutions to meet unmet social and environmental needs and problems find their performance greatly enhanced
5024266 right now the key question is not does corporate responsibility work but rather how does it work why does it work and under what specific conditions does it work the best these are the isssues that formed the original basis for my research and for this book
5024267 it is probably fair to say that leading professional services firms have made or are attempting to make the adjustment to an approach that recognizes just how little content mastery matters if the client does not trust us we would venture to say that truly great professional service firms havent just made the adjustment to that approach they are built upon it
5024268 there are additional skills involved ones that no one ever teaches you that are critical to your success
5024269 yes i really want these benefits what must i do to achieve them
5024270 eugenics had lost its credibility in the scientific community long before the nazis appropriated it for their own horrific purposes the science underpinning it was bogus and the social programs constructed upon it utterly reprehensible nevertheless by mid century the valid science of genetics human genetics in particular had a major public relations problem on its hands
5024271 my greatest fear was that this blooming public paranoia about molecular biology would result in draconian legislation
5024272 nor has the reception of gm foods been aided by the knee jerk politically craven attitudes and even scientific incompetence typical of governmental regulatory agencies in this country the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency epa when they have been confronted with these new technologies
5024273 have you noticed that in spite of differing intonation patterns the tones still remain clear and intact the relationship of tones to sentence intonation in our language can be likened to small ripples riding on large waves although the ripples may be larger than the waves the actual result is an algebraic sum of two kinds of waves where two pluses concur the result will be more plus when a plus meets a minus the algebraic addition will be an arithmetical subtraction however take care not to let the intonation mask the tone completely the tones should always be clear and distinct
5024274 all of the food looks delicious do they have crab rangoons there i could live there because i like crab rangoons

5024325 were honored that the candidates chose the saddleback civil forum on leadership and compassion for their first joint appearance an unprecedented opportunity for america to hear both men back to back on the same platform
5024326 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
5024327 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues while i know both men as friends and they recognize i will be frank but fair they also know i will be raising questions in these four areas beyond what political reporters typically ask this includes pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation such as poverty hiv aids climate and human rights
5024328 i was so obsessed with me and the reastions i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5024329 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5024330 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5024331 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5024332 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5024333 youre looking at three plus years for a principal to really make an impact in a building
5024334 were looking at getting principals placed in schools where we can start their longevity we dont look forward to having to make as many changes in the future
5024335 under a new principal progress can slow down a bit before it rebounds and goes back up
5024336 the staff the students and the parents are headed in the same direction and understand academically what youre trying to accomplish

5024339 teachers at the school recently imagined in the future how great it would be to have an administrator stay for several years and really make a difference
5024340 the idea of insurance is to protect people from catastrophic costs
5024341 at some point people arent going to consider themselves insured if theyre at risk for a huge amount out of pocket just because they have one disease rather than another
5024342 the reality is that this is where the pharmaceutical industry is focusing their research
5024343 the costs might be out of the ballpark but in the past without that drug the person might not be living or not living any type of quality of life
5024344 it gets to the fundamental question of what is insurance
5024345 at some point in our lives we may all join that small pool of users of high cost care
5024346 if i end up having to pay for those last two infusions i would have to file for bankruptcy
5024347 they want to keep employees and be good employers but there is a lot of pressure on the cost of health care right now
5024348 were trying to make sure that the benefit is kept affordable for the other 1 000 employees in the company
5024349 is a drug that costs 100 times more 100 times better
5024350 today we dont know because there is no independent entity that makes those comparisons
5024351 these tiering policies dont accomplish that they just stick it to the chronically ill
5024352 we have to recognize that we can only spend so much on health care
5024353 what are the options other than turn off the lights and say goodbye
5024354 in some instances manufacturers are charging exorbitant prices for single source drugs and prices keep increasing dramatically
5024355 i ask you how could the wealthiest nation in the world allow their disabled to go without medications specifically designed to promote their quality of life
5024356 this is going to go on until the day i die
5024357 ill be this 90 year old lady fighting for her copaxone
5024358 i felt the pilgrims pride arrests were justified and there should be even more enforcement of illegal workers in the u s along with stiffer penalties and quicker deportation
5024359 i was concerned and somewhat surprised that there were so many agencies and organizations rushing in to try to support the families of these criminals
5024360 maybe these organizations need to be concerned with the law abiding citizens and the families that are trying to work according to the laws of our land and still just barely making ends meet
5024361 its very clear that theres an unprecedented increase in deportations
5024362 i think what were seeing now is much more a political response than anything else to the fact that the republican congress and the president wanted stepped up enforcement because that was campaign promises they made
5024363 na minha opini o ele putin o verdadeiro patr o da r ssia neste momento
5024364 as medidas que ele tomou na transi o de presidente a primeiro ministro nestas ltimas semanas e agora na ge rgia provam que putin quem manda na r ssia
5024365 penso que a rela o entre ele e medvedev mais complexa do que imagin vamos
5024366 penso que v amos eles como parceiros e putin tinha dado v rios sinais de que ia deixar o poder seguir seu curso e ficar com a presid ncia de que medvedev seria o verdadeiro respons vel por dirigir a r ssia
5024367 usam uma ret rica remanescente da uni o sovi tica
5024368 queremos que os russos que est o prontos para contemplar o futuro russos como talvez o presidente medvedev comecem a exercer uma maior influ ncia e consigam controlar a ret rica de certas pessoas

5024375 hes growing up and i think a vote of confidence right about now might be something that can help him
5024376 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
5024377 we are being crucified on why the taser usage and our members actions at the preliminary stages
5024378 just watched the taser video on bbc tv in australia
5024379 and we hope that when more of the facts are made public it will present a clearer picture of truly what happened
5024380 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
5024381 it appears you have been caught in an outright lie
5024382 in the world of communications police have often been criticized for not giving details and or information regarding an incident resulting in allegations that we are hiding something
5024383 as for myself as a spokesperson in the future i will consider saying that we have no comment theres an ongoing investigation and weather the storm of media criticism that we are not forthcoming
5024384 we have to ensure that we have an open relationship with the media because we rely on the media to get the message out to the public
5024385 so how are you going to lie your way out of this one
5024386 when will charges of manslaughter be brought against the officers
5024387 seeing as there will be no proper action taken against the criminals i should hope a similar fate befalls their families
5024388 after the millions of good things that we have done it was very disheartening to see that level of backlash and anger from the public
5024389 i see on the news eight people have died in five years thats about 1 5 a year how many would have died if we didnt have the taser
5024390 of those eight how many had pre existing conditions that likely contributed if not were the cause of death
5024391 stand by for the autopsy results we might be in for a surprise like tasers didnt kill this guy pre existing medical conditions and or drugs in the system wait and see
5024392 in an unprecedented action and in contradiction to his request of the prior week
5024393 this left no legal basis for the videotape to be held

5024395 centralist establishes that the state will have exclusive control over everything and pushes us towards totalitarianism
5024396 this is an issue that is not on the table
5024397 president musharraf has been a good ally and everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was just to his word he took off his uniform it is now a democratic government in pakistan
5024398 i want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5024399 we have been supportive of their new democratic government as witnessed by the presidents meetings with prime minister gilani so this is a matter for pakistan to determine
5024400 because these terrorists are not just after the united states and after afghanistan they are also after pakistan as demonstrated by the fact that they killed mrs bhutto
5024401 that is what we are concentrating on and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy

5024443 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5024444 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5024445 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5024446 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5024447 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5024448 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5024449 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5024450 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely

5024459 i dont think that by studying science you 1 mg propecia finasteride to conclude that there must be a god obfuscate a christian coyne believes in the universe as in some sense a creation of god hence he says god must be reflected in that universe so far most of those in the science religion field have been working within a christian context but there is growing concern to bring into the dialog people from other faith traditions up until the eighteenth century most of those in europe studying science were indeed men deep religious faith many of them formally schooled in theology the courses run the spectrum from specifically historical courses to those dealing with the interface between evolution and religion genetics and religion ecology and religion cosmology and religion there are now a dozen centers around the world devoted to this dialog not until the eighteenth century do we see a fundamental break between science and religion obfuscate faith and reason

5024466 there is little if any evidence that increased corporate size in already large national and international firms produces greater technological innovation
5024467 to the contrary it probably leads to less given lower competitive pressures and the starving of research in debt burdened companies
5024468 after the dust has settled thousands of employees fired surplus executives generously pensioned off and a vast new debt accumulated the merged giant usually performs less well than did its major components formerly and the stock price goes down in recognition of less favorable prospects
5024469 consolidation has unleashed behavior for which the term robber baron seems too tame
5024470 many mergers appear designed more to create new opportunities for the enrichment of ceos and favored stock purchasers and to gratify testosterone fueled empire building rather than to shuck off excess capacity create new synergies or reap economies of scale
5024471 we have seen the shocking results in 2001 2002 as giant after giant reveals financial chicanery that enriched the managerial elite while looting the company to the severe disadvantage of workers pensioners stockholders and communities
5024472 a broad expectation among businesses and citizens that conspiracies in restraint of trade and other methods of unfair competition will be prosecuted
5024473 conceptualized almost solely in terms of the price of goods and services stripping away the broader democratic concerns that had once been at the center of antitrust philosophy
5024474 merger and monopoly case filings dropped to half the level of 1970 and only the most extreme horizontal mergers were now suspect vertical and conglomerate mergers were of little or no concern
5024475 it is time not to abandon it antitrust policy but to share it to reinforce the fledgling efforts of other nations to develop their own policies and to cooperate in the development of a tough international policy against economic concentration and corporate bullying
5024476 there is little if any evidence that increased corporate size in already large national and
5024477 is carried on behind closed doors in defiance of open meeting laws
5024478 because secrecy surrounds trustee selection confirmation and service citizens and voters have to determine in ignorance whether elected officials are putting the best people in positions of authority over educational institutions
5024479 the appointment is a payoff a tribute a point of prestige often pointed to with pride by trustees who never darkened the doors of a college as a student
5024480 is done behind closed doors unless there is someone to bring charges
5024481 in a classic example of a trustee smoke screen boston university officials would not disclose details about the policy changes
5024482 faculty hiring and tenure and promotion decisions are confidential so young men and women hired or denied a position promoted or turned down tenured or released do not know if their fate was sealed by their performance politics or circumstances over which they had no control
5024483 the candidate is not likely to ever know what occurred at the meeting or in the vote even if a job is offered and taken
5024484 there may be a vote by the tenured faculty but the reasons for the decision are not shared with the candidate
5024485 when parents try to scout a path through the muddle of admissions policies they find themselves rebuffed by the authorities who have no interest in opening the process to scrutiny and thereby risking loss of their power of discretion
5024486 rarely a straightforward open process with operating rules clearly stated
5024487 unwritten rules developed and applied in secret can be more important in a final accreditation decision than the stated ones
5024488 higher than market faculty salary levels and costly unnecessary expenditures in virtually every other aspect of law schools thereby forcing tuition and fees too high for most minorities working class people and graduates of less than elite colleges and universities
5024489 due to secrecy nobody outside the small accrediting in group can assess whether schools are being treated equally whether there is unfairness among schools and whether there is favoritism for schools with connections
5024490 the costs are borne by society taxpayers who are denied an unobstructed view of activities carried out in their name and at their expense by scholars kept from making the most of their careers and by students and their parents with limited information who are forced to make life path decisions about where the students should attend college and secrecy affects academic institutions themselves through an accreditation process that reinforces a cycle of confidentiality at the expense of society

5024494 unless and until this prosecution starts being done and i stress the need for the gallows when the crime warrants it we will
5024495 a dramatic growth of government secrecy far beyond the secrecy occurring during the clinton administration
5024496 through executive agency opinions executive orders statutory changes and aggressive litigation the bush administration has effectively limited the power of foia freedom of information act and reversed the presumption that government records should be available to the public absent demonstrable proof showing that secrecy is needed
5024497 the administrations sweeping expansion of the power of federal government to classify records and so hide them from public view increases the range of information that may be classified and extends the lifetime of such secrecy
5024498 outside the public eye and empowered himself to keep congress in the dark about intelligence matters
5024499 blanket closures of ins immigration and naturalization service proceedings and absolute gags on disclosure of related information eviscerate the time honored constitutional protection of open public trials
5024500 arrested and refused to identify hundreds of aliens who either may be connected to terrorism as material witnesses or who may have visa or other ins infractions
5024501 legislation championed as essential to protect the nation against terrorist threats allows the federal government to spy on its citizens to detain them in secret without charges to prosecute them based on secret evidence and to prohibit parties to the trial from discussing related information
5024502 although the now prevailing presumption of closed government is masked in subtle nuances of language and interpretive guidelines we may liken the shift to the sea change that would occur in our criminal justice system if we moved from a presumption of innocent until proven guilty to an assumption of guilty until proven innocent
5024503 the citizenry gives up its vital check on abuse of government power and gains little in return

5024582 seorang anak akan menghormati bapaknya dan seorang hamba akan menghormati tuannya dan jika aku adalah seorang bapa dimanakah hormatmu kepada ku dan jika aku adalah tuan dimanakah takutmu kepada ku
5024583 tuhan itu maha tahu dipanggil apapun dia mengerti yang penting maksud hati kita memanggi dia tetapi tidak pernah mencoba berempati bagaimana jika bapa yahweh itu dipanggil allah
5024584 baptislah mereka dalam nama bapa dan anak dan roh kudus
5024585 lihat aku berdiri di muka pintu dan mengetok jikalau ada orang yang mendengar suara ku dan membukakan pintu aku akan masuk mendapatkannya dan aku makan bersama sama dengan dia dan ia bersama sama dengan aku

5024608 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
5024609 it has become clear in recent months that a critical mass of the american
5024610 right you are correct someone hooked me i do believe in building relationships that is what christians are required to do i am amoral i am sure you know what that means so are scorpios i am being protected by the formosa rule because of my mental illness i am not targeting teh mop jockey you are and you are using me as a bait please stop i have my own fish to reel in leave me alone it is my hope that i will be able to catch a fish and reel it in for you once my retired bishop thought i was fishing for him and he took the bait alas it wasnt me and that spelled the demise of our relationship have a little bit more faith in me an eastern orthodox bishop thought i was fishing for him and willingly proudly and defiantly took the bait on public record and it wasnt even me give me a break

5024612 when there are explosions you can feel the whole town shake
5024613 this particular project at 300 gold would be very marginal
5024614 the issue with exploration and development projects right now is the risk involved in finding mineralization
5024615 whats interesting about the old timers is that they took meticulous records and theyve been preserved so a lot of your exploration has been done so your risk profile is very very much lower
5024616 and generally in old mining areas theres a culture of mines people understand somewhat what youre doing
5024617 the security situation is good and it is progressing every day
5024618 we have some greedy politicians they put their self interest in front of the peoples interest we have a big number of political parties delineated according to their tribes the terrorists might exploit the conflicts

5024622 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
5024623 i dont see why they signed it if they dont want to implement it
5024624 this does not depend on us alone because we are constantly coming up against some problems on the georgian side
5024625 everything depends on how effectively and quickly these problems are solved
5024626 if they violate their own agreement that has even more serious consequences
5024627 siempre que no tengas zapatos piensa que otros no tienen pie
5024628 i am so happy to go and live my religion
5024629 the council must lead by example and where possible use renewable sources of energy
5024630 the people are forced to choose between their cows and their children
5024631 there is no pretense that its for any other purpose its something quite unique
5024632 absolutely there are people who are getting extremely rich out of this
5024633 worse than a failed state it has become virtually a phantom state
5024634 in the villages the zaraguina have all control the government does nothing to help us
5024635 i cried all the time they hit us and they left us outside in the dirt until we had things crawling on our skin backs and arms
5024636 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
5024637 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
5024638 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
5024639 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
5024640 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
5024641 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
5024642 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
5024643 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
5024644 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
5024645 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
5024646 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
5024647 we have less unity than we did just two years ago and after nearly 20 years were talking more about points that divide us than unify us
5024648 the biggest critics are in the concertacion but the leaders dont want to hear about it
5024649 pinochet is gone the human rights values battle has been won and democracy is consolidated
5024650 the reasons for the concertacions existence just dont exist anymore
5024651 this was a serious assault on a young woman which has left her deeply shocked and distressed
5024652 at around the time of the assault the beach area was packed with people and to help jog memories the band performing on stage was called the ryes
5024653 i would encourage anyone with information about this incident to contact north yorkshire police immediately
5024654 id like to reassure our community and those visiting that this festival has been running for several years without serious incident
5024655 estranged the use of our vocabulary in terms of our definition of the all mighty allah

5024661 noticed a wild dog on the roadside nursing her litter and posted one of his companions juayl ad damari to stand guard near her so that the entire contingent could pass without disturbing her or the pups by any measure it was proactive mercy that spelled the death of idolatry and paganism in mecca
5024662 in a faith like islam which teaches that a person may be condemned to hell for starving a cat it goes without saying that acts of ruthless barbarity must be rejected and never given the aura of religious sanctity
5024663 i was not sent to bring down curses i was only sent as a special mercy
5024664 havent they travelled the earth and seen how those before them ended up
5024665 bei uns gibt es noch vieles zu verbessern aber es war ganz wichtig mit den drei punkten in die saison zu starten
5024666 ich habe nur noch die leute schreien geh rt und konnte mich beim besten willen nicht mehr konzentrieren bei diesen schmetterb llen darf man nicht gest rt werden sonst gehen sie daneben
5024667 viele der zuschauer sind mit den bedingungen die bei einem tennis turnier herrschen m ssen einfach nicht vertraut

5024669 la rbita de la tierra no es perfectamente regular esta oscila a medida que gira de modo que su inclinaci n cambia siguiendo un ciclo de 41 mil a os y los polos se acercan m s al sol en unas pocas que en otras estas oscilaciones de la rbita de la tierra provocan cambios clim ticos que afectan a todo el ecosistema
5024670 la principal raz n de la variabilidad clim tica de la tierra tendr a m s que ver con la astronom a espec ficamente con la caprichosa actividad solar que ha demostrado no ser homog nea a trav s de d cadas y siglos
5024671 no se puede negar un calentamiento la discusi n es si fue generado por el ser humano o si es natural hay efectos de la acci n del hombre pero es mucho m s probable que sea un producto natural
5024672 en el mbito cient fico nadie discute que es una realidad del presente porque en mi caso en concreto las evidencias cient ficas son aplastantes en los ltimos ciento cincuenta a os los cambios han sido de una enorme rapidez y significativamente distintos a lo que hab a ocurrido con anterioridad
5024673 no importa lo que hagamos en este momento est n desapareciendo y vamos a perder los glaciares tropicales los glaciares de los andes y del kilimanjaro en frica
5024674 los glaciares son indicadores muy sensibles del cambio clim tico los que tenemos en per est n experimentando un proceso de deglaciaci n o retroceso muy acelerado
5024675 el calentamiento no afecta solo al que emite sino a todos los pa ses del planeta pero le afecta m s a los pa ses latinoamericanos porque son los m s vulnerables somos pa ses eminentemente agr colas y el cambio clim tico afecta pues se cambian los climas
5024676 el patrimonio natural tur stico se ve afectado con la disminuci n de la superficie los glaciares patag nicos una de las m ltiples razones por la que t cnicos y cient ficos trabajan en la elaboraci n de los posibles escenarios geogr ficos y clim ticos con el objeto de anticipar y morigerar las eventuales consecuencias del cambio clim tico
5024677 el cambio clim tico se ha revelado como una de las principales amenazas para los espacios protegidos y se deben tomar medidas para la urgente reducci n de las emisiones de co2 si quieren evitarse da os irreversibles en los espacios protegidos del mundo
5024678 que el calentamiento global est afectado seriamente el lugar ya que est n desapareciendo plantas y los animales huyen a zonas m s altas
5024679 hasta ahora la pol tica de conservaci n que estaba basada en la red de parques nacionales o naturales o en la red natura 2000 ha sido una estrategia muy aceptada y ha tenido unos resultados muy positivos pero claramente es insuficiente en un mundo donde los seres vivos que pretendemos proteger se mueven a una velocidad mayor de lo que pensamos por lo tanto salen de las reservas que hemos creado y tenemos que poner en marcha otros tipos de mecanismos que nos permita ser mucho m s giles por los territorios por el que los seres vivos se van a mover figuras en las que no sea necesaria que la titularidad sea p blica pero que s se pueda incorporar a los propietarios privados en la necesidad y obligaci n de conservar la biodiversidad
5024680 es uno de los sitios m s biodiversos del planeta en esa excepcional biodiversidad se sustenta la raz n para la conservaci n
5024681 la lucha contra el cambio clim tico solidaridad frente a un mundo dividido
5024682 las diferencias entre las temperaturas m ximas y m nimas se achicaron y esto hace que los inviernos sean m s agradables
5024683 en los ltimos 20 a os los glaciares a lo largo de la patagonia han disminuido en su extensi n entre un 10 y un 20
5024684 en los pr ximos 20 a os la mayor a de los nevados peruanos solo ser n postales del recuerdo
5024685 a fines de la d cada del 80 los campos de hielo del sur argentina y chile hab an reducido su superficie en aproximadamente unos 500 kil metros cuadrados
5024686 una de las principales consecuencias del cambio clim tico es la reducci n de las masas de hielo en pr cticamente todo el planeta destacando los cambios en groenlandia el rtico canadiense los andes de sudam rica y la ant rtica nuestro pa s no es ajeno a este problema puesto que sus glaciares est n retrocediendo aceleradamente con consecuencias a n poco conocidas para nuestra sociedad
5024687 el agua en las ciudades de latinoam rica depende de los glaciares que se est n derritiendo
5024688 el cambio clim tico afecta al ecuador y otros pa ses andinos directamente en la forma de deshielo de los glaciares y p rdida de las reservas de agua nadie est compensando al ecuador por este da o
5024689 el valor de la biodiversidad tiende a incrementarse conforme al ritmo de su destrucci n
5024690 el cambio clim tico es un fen meno global pero las consecuencias son regionales
5024691 y la triste realidad en am rica latina es que la poblaci n que vive cerca de los glaciares no tiene nada que ver con el aumento de las emisiones de di xido de carbono en la atm sfera
5024692 como ge logo s que hace miles de a os atr s los glaciares han retrocedido todav a m s de lo que est ocurriendo ahora entonces es fundamental conocer el impacto actual en las altas monta as cosa que efectivamente est volviendo a ocurrir
5024693 una de las herramientas para crear conciencia en la ciudadan a sobre el cambio clim tico es la educaci n y la prioridad de poner en un primer plano la humanidad y no cometer la bonanza de poner en riesgo el futuro de las nuevas generaciones
5024694 es sumamente importante mantener el hielo y la nieve ya que es ah donde se expresa con mayor evidencia el impacto que puede tener el cambio clim tico en la biodiversidad el agua y hasta en la cultura este tema adem s de ser muy grave en los polos tambi n es sumamente impactante en nuestra regi n
5024695 el cambio clim tico est destruyendo nuestro derecho a la vida la salud y los medios de subsistencia los estados que no reconocen estos impactos y no toman medidas violan nuestros derechos humanos
5024696 veo con preocupaci n que los efectos del cambio clim tico son cada vez m s notorios y que podr an notarse a n m s en el futuro a medida que los acontecimientos clim ticos extremos se intensifican
5024697 our duty is to act decisively and make sure we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
5024698 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
5024699 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
5024700 the kind of thing youd expect in a police state
5024701 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
5024702 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
5024703 wir wollten das schon lange wir wollen dass unsere beziehung legal ist und wir sind sehr sehr aufgeregt
5024704 ich glaube eines tages werden die leute darauf zur ckschauen wie auf die verweigerung des wahlrechts f r frauen oder die rassentrennung oder sonst etwas l cherliches das uns nicht allen dieselben rechte gibt
5024705 emma freut sich riesig und wir sind alle stolz auf sie
5024706 ich werden nicht l gen ich bef rchte dass da die b cher vorbei sind die vorfreude nicht mehr die gleiche sein wird
5024707 you are never expected to give a present that equals your price of admission to any party you should give the present that you are comfortable giving that you can afford that you think would please the child and his or her family
5024708 some people will be sensitive so be prepared with explanations
5024709 we have to be careful in each word we write
5024710 if we write something that isnt in favour of the militants resistance groups the military or the government then we are in a dangerous situation
5024711 for being iraqis we are in a more delicate situation because we dont have anywhere to hide or anyone to support
5024712 sometimes we have to hide behind foreigners to be protected
5024713 nothing is being done to protect journalists covering the iraq situation
5024714 it is becoming intolerable especially when you see that the proposed democracy is just for politicians but not for other professionals or ordinary iraqis
5024715 in addition to being easy targets to survive we have to accept working as journalists but having our names hidden while foreigners take all the credit by using our stories under their by line

5024722 we are enjoying ourselves here a lot as every one here is a twin and i hope that this programme will be organised every year
5024723 we are feeling very good as every one here is a twin earlier we used to feel only we are like this but after coming here we feel that there are others like us

5024753 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5024754 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5024755 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5024756 in any of the emerging nations we all understand it is a necessity we need roads but how do we make them safe for the children pedestrians motorcyclists and things like that well be at the united nations in march to beg them for help and make them really understand and recognize that this is a major problem and its just going to get worse

5024761 i dont know why i asked he knows what he needs to do to conserve his energy
5024762 we were giving him support letting him know how proud we were and that we stand behind him whatever the outcome might be
5024763 for this to happen everything had to fall into perfect place
5024764 if we had to do this again i dont know if it would happen exactly the way we wanted it to
5024765 i am so blessed so privileged to be here to watch him swim live
5024766 i thought maybe hes not as focused in the schoolhouse but i saw a love and passion for swimming in him at a young age
5024767 he could be there for hours during a swim meet
5024768 of course we are all paying attention to what is going on
5024769 but by no means does one person on the team take precedence over any other during a meet like this
5024770 i think 90 of the swimmers when they are done with their event just come here to watching michael phelps
5024771 because everything that he does is also better for us
5024772 i was saying to myself all right andrew this is pretty special so look around and try to remember this moment standing next to the worlds greatest swimmer someone who is trying to recreate history
5024773 i feel privileged to be in an era with such a great swimmer
5024774 i couldnt care less about my swims winning eight gold medals is pretty impressive
5024775 i want to raise the bar for the sport of swimming as high as it can get in the us
5024776 weve come a long way i heard that in ravens stadium in baltimore phelps hometown they were watching the 400 medley relay live with 70 000 people i heard that at the cincinnati reds game yesterday they showed the 100 fly live i heard there was an announcement at yankee stadium people all over the place are saying that if you go out to eat and the tv is on swimming is on the tv four years ago there was no way that would ever happen i think the sport of swimming can go even farther
5024777 when we train every day and sometimes we do sets or workouts we dont like bob says its putting money in the bank and at the end of the year well be able to withdraw
5024778 i guess we put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny so after bob and i both take a little break itll be time to start re depositing
5024779 ive got so much respect for her she was one of my biggest rivals when i was still swimming she quit for many years she had a baby and then to come back she is a role model for a lot of swimmers especially older swimmers

5024784 before the forum takes place let me say how weird the whole event appears to me as a catholic priest first my understanding is that the forum will take place in the sanctuary of the saddleback church i think that is inappropriate a church hall would be ok but not the sanctuary which should be reserved for worship service this is not a question of separation of church and state i leave that to the constitutional lawyers this is a question of what is religiously appropriate and inappropriate to do in churches catholics appear to have a very different standard than evangelicals both white and black the vatican is even opposed to holding concerts in churches second imagine for a second that the forum was being sponsored by cardinal francis george of chicago and was held in the sanctuary of his cathedral the outcry would be defining the public and the media appear more easily to accept political activity by evangelical clergy than by catholic clergy catholic clergy are held to a higher standard for example pat robertson and jesse jackson can run for president but imagine what would happen if cardinal george or cardinal egan ran for president dont get me wrong i do not want catholic cardinals or clergy publicly getting involved in partisan politics i am happy that canon law and tradition restrict political activity by catholic clergy i just wonder if there is a double standard here

5024815 systems design can no longer be isolated from procurement and manufacturing engineers need to focus on all elements that go into their designs
5024816 in a standard dram there is a capacitor and a transistor
5024817 the capacitor stores the logic state 1 or 0 and the transistor provides the rest of the circuitry access to the capacitor to read a dram cell the transistor is turned on and the charge on the capacitor is allowed to flow onto a bitline creating a small voltage which can then be detected
5024818 the fbc is a planar device on soi but the film thicknesses are very different from what is considered conventional soi
5024819 for example the buried oxide thickness is only 10nm compared with gt 100nm for most common soi implementations that means an soi design for a thick bottom oxide box wont work on thin box and vice versa this is one of many integration issues that need to be resolved before we can choose a technology option
5024820 a scaled floating body cell memory with high k metal gate on thin silicon and thin box for 15nm node and beyond
5024821 the devices with 60nm gates show suitable memory retention and at this dimension a bit cell could be less than 0 01 there is also excellent agreement between device and simulation that allows prediction of continued scaling to the 10nm technology node
5024822 this paper demonstrates new adaptive circuit techniques that would allow lowering the minimum operating supply voltage of sram cache cells by making the cells more tolerant to variations in process voltage and temperature
5024823 under certain operating conditions measurements on a 45nm test chip show that number of single cell errors is reduced by as much as 26x these circuits could allow intel to push to better performance and power characteristics without failures on future processes
5024824 today analog designers have to be comfortable in both analog and digital designs a demanding task that makes them rare highly regarded and well paid
5024825 mixed signal expertise is what we look for when investing in semiconductor makers
5024826 analog circuitry on a digital chip is the secret sauce that can make a proprietary semiconductor uniquely qualified for high volume applications thats where the money is
5024827 in the united states we are producing around 1 000 analog engineers annually from our top universities but 10 or 20 times that many digital engineers are graduating
5024828 there are a lot of ees graduating but fewer and fewer are specializing in analog
5024829 with 23 000 employees in 30 countries we tried to make up our shortfall in the u s by recruiting from other countries so we opened development centers in many areas across the world in order to tap into the analog talent wherever it might be
5024830 we found that eastern europe and asia both had growing markets with analog engineering talent unfortunately we also found that many were without the depth of expertise you need to participate in the global economy we can find really great digital talent everywhere in the world but we are still having a hard time finding experienced analog talent anywhere in the world
5024831 our heritage was to use motorola as our analog supplier but as an independent company we had to start our own programs to attract analog engineers and we have been very fortunate
5024832 we have many talented recruits but we still need more and will hire as many as we can get
5024833 we complement one of our senior managers with several less experienced engineers so that he can mentor them
5024834 this allows the manager to work on more than one design at a time by delegating the tasks that are time consuming but require less experience
5024835 a digital engineer can often start making significant contributions to a company just six months after graduating
5024836 but analog technology requires five to seven years of on the job experience before engineers can begin making significant contributions
5024837 digital has become so popular that people often assume analog is the old technology
5024838 i say the best thing that ever occurred to analog was the digital revolution the digital gadgets have to interface with the real world which is analog to create those interfaces you need analog engineers
5024839 on may 12 the day when the earthquake hit sichuan chengdu felt the quake most of the enterprises stopped working that day and the next to evaluate losses caused by the quake and ensure the safety of the personnel on may 13 15 most of the enterprises resumed production
5024840 at that time vendors from u s japan and taiwan reacted calmly as earthquakes have occurred in those countries during the quake there was no destruction to the electricity water and gas facilities in the zone but the earthquake affected us mainly in the fact that negotiations of some investment projects were halted pending evaluation of the impact of the earthquake
5024841 to our knowledge none of intels equipment was damaged intel promptly restored production soon after the experts came from the united states to assess the buildings and equipment and confirmed that there was no damage two units of precision equipment from huawei symantec were damaged due to unstable installation but the problem was promptly solved chengdu city does not change its principle that construction projects should be built to withstand six earthquakes because chengdu is not located on the earthquake belt if the anti quake protection is to be upgraded to an additional level the total construction cost will increase by 10 percent but up to the end of 2009 there will be relevant favorable policies such as reducing the cost of construction registration
5024842 we organized a team of experts to investigate the constructions in the zone immediately after the quake no problems were reported concerning the main frame of the constructions the endangered buildings that are to be dismantled did not fall due to the quake either
5024843 smic has hundreds of assembly and testing equipment in our fab some were displaced in the earthquake but did not get damaged the day after the quake we resumed production and 70 80 percent of the employees returned to normal working schedules a week afterwards 100 percent of production capacity was restored
5024844 within a few days our production was restored and we began to arrange our delivery as before afterwards our factory operation was not at all affected we also helped affected staff to apply for relief funds and they are now very emotionally stable
5024845 recently our chairman craig barrett visited chengdu to attest that our investment in chengdu will not change
5024846 for two or three days we did not work in the office we used flexible management the earthquake caused parts of the ceilings to fall off and had an impact on the r amp d process but on the whole the buildings in the zone were safe
5024847 the greater impact is on the employees psychological well being as 99 percent of our staff had never experienced an earthquake before
5024848 after the quake hq reduced workload but at present none of the employees have used the earthquake as an excuse to delay work
5024849 the working process is on the right track now there are no problems as long as there are no problems with the people
5024850 there are 15 large scale manufacturing enterprises in the west park with over 7 000 employees there were no deaths or injuries as a consequence of the earthquake and by may 13 most of the enterprises had restored production
5024851 the precision equipment are generally built to withstand earthquakes so there was no damage reported from the current perspective the production capacity in may was lower than before but by june it had completely recovered since the enterprises in the area are mostly export oriented there was no influence on the orders on the contrary there was an increase
5024852 we had some difficulty right after the quake especially with flight transportation capacity many enterprises send their products to hong kong and other places mainly by air transport but the earthquake caused a significant decrease in the number of people traveling between chengdu and hong kong thus causing a corresponding decrease in flights
5024853 we took the initiative immediately after the earthquake to apply for government subsidies for direct cargo flights between chengdu and hong kong as early as the beginning of july
5024854 we have already filed an application with the state department and hope to achieve this target around september
5024855 the comprehensive free trade zone is a major step of cdht in the future
5024856 the earthquake had some negative effects on cdht and chengdu has been financially affected some enterprises slowed down their pace
5024857 by adopting every effective measure possible we have quickly restored production capacity in the zone to 100 percent which greatly boosts the confidence of investors our investors policies do not change because chengdu does not change and the geological structure is also stable
5024858 our strategy is not to be the fastest growing or the largest flash memory supplier our strategy is not to spend huge amounts of money building a new wafer fabrication every year like the competition our strategy is to achieve profitability through the efficiency and cooperation between intel and st to lead in the flash memory industry
5024859 well not be the market share leader at the expense of profitability or our clients benefits on the contrary our strategy is built upon delivering systems solutions and unique value to our customers focused on a few selected segments to provide value
5024860 our partnership with hynix gives us access to the cost efficiency so we can get scale and size through our partnership
5024861 our relationship with hynix is quite crucial we will make capital investments and well expand capacity when the market requires us to do so
5024862 i expect the other market segments to grow faster than wireless so in time the markets will be more balanced i expect nand technology to grow faster than nor so that will become more balanced as well
5024863 in terms of future technology we have clear leadership in the nor market we had 65nm in production in q4 06 our competitors are just now introducing 65nm technology we have 45nm way down the path in development and well be ready in the near future our competitors have plans and talk about a rapid introduction of 45nm however realistically it takes a couple of years from 65nm to 45nm
5024864 anytime samsung is in the market place you should pay close attention because it is a very strong competitor
5024865 samsung provides services to consumers on one hand but on the other hand they might compete with consumers in other aspects for example samsung itself is running in the business of ssd and sd cards as well as offering multimedia processors but were not competing with our customers our strategy is to serve clients rather than compete with them
5024866 this is a market where we have a strong product portfolio were providing customized solutions for these applications
5024867 the new company will do much more in mpc innovation
5024868 that is because we have a complete offering including nor nand and dram numonyx will meet different needs of different clients by offering customized mcp
5024869 i dont see pcm to replace nor nor to replace nand or dram but to expand and complement those technologies
5024870 i can give an example from history we have nor flash and expanded the market very quickly before but it didnt replace eeprom instead it created a lot of innovative applications i think pcm will do just the same and will emerge as some memory technology that becomes very exciting
5024871 our philosophy and strategy is to take the best of both and create something better at numonyx
5024872 playing off the greek word mnemonics the art of assisting or improving memory
5024873 we made a survey before choosing the name and customers said they wanted to have a memory aiding device something you do to help you remember
5024874 with this amoled driver we are extending a leadership position in the existing amoled mobile display market to the emerging variable portable electronics products market
5024875 this is the first of many products that we are developing for the mid size amoled display market
5024876 one of these new processes has already been fully qualified with a key customer and will go into production immediately
5024877 the second process requires some significant product re engineering by the customer which will extend the qualification period but is expected to be in volume production in the next two years
5024878 were pleased to support this oem with our ground breaking triple path broadband 3g power amplifier
5024879 handset vendors employing our broadband 3g pa can provide a single scalable 3g platform that works well with multiple w cdma bands through simple changes in filter components the rf layout of the phone board is not needed
5024880 we plan to release an added 3g front ends with greater functionality increased dollar content and higher levels of integration as future architectures integrate duplexers switches and other functions previously placed on phone boards discretely
5024881 benq is committed to bringing enjoyment coupled with the quality of life
5024882 with these new product offerings we showcase how enjoyment reaches far beyond not only in hardware and technology but to the rest of the natural world our new low energy low emission models will set the trend for 16 9 format as well as promote social and environmental responsibility benq stays on top of the new format trend by introducing the worlds first 21 5 inch full hd model earlier this month and setting the trend for greener 16 9 displays
5024883 all generations of ddr interfaces remain a top priority for customers designing complex socs
5024884 as part of the dram standards committee synopsys anticipates future dram products and aims to develop memory interfaces to match dram availability timelines and targets
5024885 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5024886 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5024887 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5024888 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5024889 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5024890 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5024891 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5024892 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5024893 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5024894 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5024895 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5024896 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5024897 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5024898 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5024899 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5024900 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5024901 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5024902 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5024903 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5024904 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5024911 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step

5024949 no depende s lo de nosotros ya que nos estamos encontrando con toda clase de problemas creados por la parte georgiana todo depende de lo r pido que se solventen esos problemas

5024981 after several years researching and developing the required standards e g xml rdf and owl semantic technology is increasingly finding its way out of research labs and into real world applications large vendors such as yahoo and oracle along with a whole host of vc funded start ups including ontoprise hakia ontotext twine and many more are incorporating semantic technology in the their products and services in addition significant end user organisations such as thomson reuters and astra zeneca are reporting the benefits of deploying the technology in business applications estc aims to make the experience and learning of such organisations available to others to explain the business benefits and to accelerate the uptake of this important new technology
5024982 semantic technology has the potential to completely change the way enterprises work there is a significant amount of research and development underway in europe but more european businesses should seize the opportunity and apply it to solve real life problems we want the conference to encourage this and play a major role in setting the industrys agenda for 2009 and beyond

5024985 as long as china does little to reduce growth of greenhouses gas emissions or appears to be doing little it will be politically difficult for the u s to sign a binding international treaty that commits to a serious cap on emissions
5024986 and as long as the u s either does little or appears to be doing little it is impossible to imagine china committing to cap its own emissions
5024987 a vicious circle in which neither country will act boldly unless the other acts first and neither appears willing to act first
5024988 if we can work cooperatively with china to reduce co emissions the world stands a far greater chance of reducing the threat of global climate change if we do not it is difficult to see how china will do it alone this is a choice that two great nations have to make
5024989 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year

5024999 the great thing about these shirts is that it is the first real fashion take on what some could consider a souvenir shirt
5025000 the reason being is that the shirts represent innovative and imaginative designs on an upscale quality of shirt all these details strategically thought out allow the shirt to easily transition from daytime wear to nighttime hip
5025001 creating cool attire is just a natural extension of my specialty great design
5025002 ive been fortunate to live and work in four large metropolitan cities like los angeles london new york and miami
5025003 all of which have helped shape my design aesthetic and opened my eyes to different clothing styles and ideas

5025010 whether he quits or counters the impeachment move will be decided after he sees the charges
5025011 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
5025012 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the
5025013 i realize im getting a lot the attention and i hope its not bothering you
5025014 i feel awkward about this situation because weve always shared our dreams about getting married i wish this could be happening to us both at the same time
5025015 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
5025016 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun

5025031 never has america seen two more intensely controversial and blatantly anti environmental political appointees than watt and gorsuch
5025032 i think mccain will want to distant himself from bush who is currently unpopular with the public and by extension bushs brand of conservatism
5025033 but mccain got to where he is now by making his peace with bush notably on iraq but also on economics he seems to be running for george w s third term thats not what the country needs
5025034 nowadays any republican running for president needs one liberal issue he can point to as proof that he is not the scary sort of conservative for john mccain in the months ahead that issue may well be the environment
5025035 too often the public views republicans as favoring big business at the expense of the environment and as too eager to swing the meat ax of repeal when the scalpel of reform is whats needed
5025036 how is it possible that we have merited to be here in israel

5025040 saya memang suka dengan sepak bola bulu tangkis saya berharap ini tidak dipersempit dengan tafsir politik yang sangat pendek
5025041 pilihan saya jatuh pada penyelenggaraan kejuaraan futsal karena olahraga ini relatif tidak membutuhkan lapangan besar waktu banyak dan melibatkan banyak orang anak bangsa perlu diberi alternatif kegiatan yang menyehatkan dan positif saya berharap ini bisa menguatkan modal sosial untuk menyalakan semangat olahraga rakyat dan bangsa tidak ada bangsa yang maju tanpa rakyatnya yang sehat

5025043 we have found there was another inconsistency in the police report that was given to us six weeks later and on the instruction of the minister
5025044 we have no comment to make until the legal team meets and deliberates on the report
5025045 i have seen the first medical report and privy to the second medical report based on that there is no case for me to answer
5025046 i view myself as a true and viable alternative to the other two parties there are issues fundamental issues that are important to large blocs of voters and the two major parties are not addressing them

5025052 oleh karena itu perlu dipahami mengenai posisi tidur ideal termasuk pola tidur yang sehat
5025053 karena pada posisi terlentang kondisi tulang belakang benar benar pada posisi yang seharusnya
5025054 kendati demikian setiap orang bisa memiliki posisi tidur yang nyaman tetapi tetap saja secara umum untuk kebaikan ototnya kondisi tidur harus lurus terlentang
5025055 kalau untuk bayi lebih bagus posisi tidur tengkurap karena bisa lebih nyaman
5025056 sehingga tentunya aliran darah tidak lancar makanya ada yang saat terjaga dari tidur tangannya kesemutan
5025057 apalagi jika tidur di media yang keras seperti lantai maka tentu tulang dadanya terasa sakit bukan hanya pernapasan
5025058 there is no energy crisis what happened is that it rained less this year so the growth in electric energy created with gas has to compensate for electric energy produced by hydro power

5025077 vorige week maandagavond zaten mijn vrouw jos dochter hetty en ik in onze voortuin in hartje america mijn dochter had haar oude gazelle op slot tegen de garage achter het huis gezet toen ze om half n s nachts naar huis wilde gaan bleek de fiets gestolen we waren allemaal erg ontdaan erover omdat het een erfstuk is van mijn vader die een boerenbedrijf had ik kan me nog heel goed herinneren dat ik als kleine jongen met mijn kleine rode fietsje naast hem fietste
5025078 we hadden ze kunnen horen vanuit de voortuin waar we koffie zaten te drinken ze moeten de fiets zon 25 meter geruisloos hebben meegetild om achter de uitrit te komen dat zoiets in america kan gebeuren vind ik onbegrijpelijk
5025079 hetty heeft hem drie jaar geleden helemaal geschuurd weer zwart geverfd en voorzien van nieuwe banden en ketting ze heeft hem zoveel mogelijk in originele staat willen houden
5025080 je kunt wel zeggen het was maar een fiets maar deze fiets vormt een belangrijke herinnering uit mijn jeugd
5025081 ik moest al vanaf zes jaar oud v r schooltijd om 6 00 uur mee opstaan om mee te gaan melken de gazelle van mijn vader werd dan volgeladen met melkkannen soms zelfs v r op de stang zodat hij meer dan 140 liter melk meefietste die fiets was een belangrijk aspect uit het leven van die tijd en had zeker met een foto een plaats gekregen in mijn boek dat kan nu niet meer
5025082 het is natuurlijk niet hetzelfde maar zo kan ze zich in ieder geval weer verplaatsen
5025083 hij lijkt ook erg veel op de gestolen fiets want toen hetty hem voor het eerst zag dacht ze dat haar eigen fiets weer terecht was
5025084 de fiets is volgens de politie bewust meegenomen het is geen baldadigheid geweest misschien krijgt de dief berouw als hij dit leest en zet hij ons erfstuk weer op dezelfde plaats terug
5025085 who the f ck cares what john cusak is writing
5025086 it is fully accepted they prosecution demanded 14 days remand and it was given to them we will be challenging this order this is an illegal order
5025087 we leave our villages and come here during the monsoon season because back home it is all flooded with rain water so we come to kashmir in search of jobs we do this every year so that we can earn but this year due to shutdowns and curfews we did not get any work during this season therefore we are going back home
5025088 i was like dang i looked at my mom and said theyre all ing gone
5025089 can you believe this hes ing arresting me for saying
5025090 in the u s towns in kansas and the dakotas face extinction mainly because of an exodus of young people some kansas towns are fighting back by giving away free land with mixed results but some bigger centers also face the risk of annihilation urban planners across europe and north america are already grappling with what to do with shrinking cities after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 millions of residents of what had been east germany moved west more than a million apartments were simply abandoned in response the german government sponsored the shrinking cities project to study what is now a global phenomenon the project has an exhibit on tour that examines shrinkage in russias ivanovo leipzig in germany manchester and liverpool in britain and detroit in the u s whether these cities disappear entirely of course is an open question detroits population has fallen by around a third since 1950 and now equals about 950 000 it is expected to shrink slowly but steadily until at least 2030 unemployment inside the city is more than 10 the suburbs around detroit meanwhile are growing if trends hold detroit will be altered beyond recognition by 2100
5025091 the public dont always want blue lights and screeching tyres
5025092 it is hard to see through the fog of this war another pipeline through
5025093 moving forward multinationals and central asian and caspian governments may think twice about building new lines through this corridor it may even call into question the reliability of moving existing volumes through that corridor
5025094 we got btc because there was a confluence of commercial and diplomatic interests
5025095 but the didnt learn the right lessons they thought that all you had to do was lean on these countries and a new pipeline would happen but that was an abject failure
5025096 i havent heard anything about that and i havent had time to think about that issue for some days
5025097 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
5025098 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here

5025115 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
5025116 i dont think hes too worried about whos at the plate
5025117 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
5025118 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
5025119 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
5025120 hes been doing that for years when he stays healthy
5025121 may be to the u s economy what an inconvenient truth was to the environment
5025122 no me preocupa la presi n conf o en mis posibilidades estoy feliz de estar en los juegos
5025123 this exclusion of the silent majority means that many problems may never be solved and one such issue is the embarrassing treatment of natives living on reserves there are 1 2 million aboriginals in canada some 700 000 of them live on reserves in conditions similar to those of third world countries despite massive federal government spending alcoholism is widespread and the suicide rate among young natives is three times higher than in the rest of the population
5025124 can we do better of course we can if we focus on two main issues a settlement to replace the pre confederation treaties signed but never respected and a better accountability system to see how the 12 billion from ottawa is spent
5025125 you need to give away more to us to make this work
5025126 aboriginals are still frustrated with their leadership because their quality of life is deteriorating
5025127 we had one guy working on them but he got a great offer and left it was an opportunity to work on a brand new start up and nobody could turn that down

5025132 es una ceguera que hay que combatir de manera clara recordando lo que significa para un pueblo equivocarse en t rminos de corrupci n en violencia en restricci n de las libertades en frustraci n
5025133 los pueblos a veces se equivocan y a menudo la pagan caro por regla general los pueblos tienen los gobiernos que merecen tener aunque luego se arrepientan

5025137 for me to write i need certain conditions one of quiet isolation not a city
5025138 i was born not far from here so this weather is familiar i like the weather i like the growing season its a good place to work its really pleasant when im not here i think about it
5025139 hes a genuinely enthusiastic traveller with his feet on the ground
5025140 i realized how much was revealed everything is revealed its political realities economic realities its human condition how i felt about a place in the past and how i feel now
5025141 with that trip i felt such a continuous sense of discovery self discovery and discovery i thought maybe the ultimate in this would be to take the same trip again a trip that had meant a lot to me in 1973
5025142 the sort of place that gives rise to the notion that the earth is flat
5025143 a great meal a binge a visit from card players an intrigue a good nights sleep and strangers monologues framed like russian short stories
5025144 i wanted to put in everything that i found lacking in the other books dialogue characters discomfort
5025145 and theroux happened to be there at the start saying im opening up the door to this wanderlust in the american soul
5025146 i never saw myself as someone like faulkner who was writing about his home the people he knew at home his patch of landscape
5025147 i never really felt that writing about medford mass had a future
5025148 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates
5025149 the longer i stayed in bangalore the less i liked it
5025150 the place had not evolved it had been crudely transformed less city planning than the urban equivalent of botched cosmetic surgery
5025151 likeliest solution to survival in an overcrowded world an almost robotic obedience decorum rigidity order with no frills
5025152 it didnt look like this it didnt smell like this it wasnt as crowded as this at night the roads were totally empty it was like the twilight zone going through the darkness
5025153 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them
5025154 in a way you cant be a writer unless you have sort of a personality problem balanced people dont become writers obviously balanced people become gardeners they raise happy families they go to work every day they smile they have noodle salad
5025155 as im kind of six songs deep im kind of like oh ok
5025156 now that this sort of has this pattern or this trend ive written in and ive touched on 50s 60s 70s i thought ok lets see what we can come up with that has an 80s flair to it
5025157 i really wanted to be a part of it but i also knew that i really needed to focus
5025158 i had to make a choice because i wanted to make sure that all of my attention would be put towards one thing
5025159 i know that i need a certain amount of attention as an artist its like you got to know what your worth is you know
5025160 she looked into my eyes and she said as long as your intent is pure you will not be denied and thats something that has stayed with me forever
5025161 she was like an angel that was sent from the creative forces of the universe to say hey girl dont give up
5025162 i grew up in the 60s with the idea it was the most wonderful place in the world to live
5025163 one of the first mass cultural images of the south and of course its not the african american story at all its not the southern story at all
5025164 i felt like the lord brought us to shelby to do battle with our own pasts and with our own stories about our pasts
5025165 is a kind of a commitment that many generations of southerners black and white have made to try to have a multiracial democracy and try to redeem the u s constitution and the declaration of independence into more than words
5025166 who were caught between doing what was the right thing to do in terms of their faith and keeping bread on their table and having a job
5025167 that part of the story had a real wonderful resonance to me and i knew that having lived through that i could tell that story
5025168 in this story its human beings who are flawed imperfect and caught in a hard history and they are grappling to make sense of it and to fix what cannot be fixed
5025169 its not about saints and heroes but its about ordinary people like ourselves
5025170 we really have to tell the story and tell it in a way that is correct that is truthful and honest
5025171 hollywood has a way sometimes to kind of give people what they think people are ready for rather than what the truth is
5025172 it was never my intention to show the south at its best
5025173 i continually surprised myself in terms of the depth of the anger from the black community the depth of the frustration
5025174 am i bringing all that to the screen i guarantee you im not and i feel like i didnt make this movie to be the white director making the black experience but i am a director telling a story and that i can do
5025175 i bought myself the small size to try out and am thoroughly impressed i have used many arnica rubs and similar products in the past and feel that hammer balm is the best product of its kind that i have ever used thanks for such a great product
5025176 im geh use einer festplatte ist ein vakuum und so bl d das jetzt auch klingt der kopf schwebt auf einem luftpolster
5025177 we have a transparent country a free press even though anti government newspapers have suffered on the revenue side and self censorship is evident in the past few years we must look at these things carefully because when we lose it the effect would be large
5025178 i believe its important that hong kong does not become another chinese city our cost is from a few times higher in some categories to being 20 times higher in other categories such as low end labour so its extremely important that we maintain our edge
5025179 if achieving the hong kong dream becomes a vanishing hope then our society will suffer
5025180 what would the hong kong dream be its no different from the american dream whereby an everyday man on the street who works hard would be able to make good savings and use those savings as equity for their future small business
5025181 we had been busy building up fibre infrastructure under the ground in hong kong and underneath the homes of people so when we launched iptv it was relatively smoother sailing than in other territories
5025182 i just got a text message from her that the team she brought together from tin shui wai has won an anti drug campaign from the government led by the attorney generals office
5025183 dual action cleanse has changed my life i feel healthier and happier wonderful i would absolutely recommend dual action cleanse to anybody
5025184 i was a little bit skeptical about dual action cleanse at first i have done other cleanses but they are complicated i love dual action cleanse it was easy and i got positive results from it
5025185 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

5025190 for the last twelve hours inhuman and indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the georgian territory continued the scale of devastating destruction and loss of innocent lives has yet to be assessed russian ground troops armed invasion transformed already in a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population
5025191 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was
5025192 definitely there has to be a very clear timeline timeline ok
5025193 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
5025194 what the bolivian people have expressed today is the consolidation of change were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization
5025195 yeah i actually i was dragged out by the police so you can see like ive been bleeding from like being dragged on the floor and then this is from the security guards this is from the security guards inside when they had this like cardboard that was like slicing my arm open in the beginning we hoped to actually go in and we hoped to hold up a tibetan flag and also this other banner you know in protest of the communist partys one party rule in china
5025196 we ask the united nations and the international society to push north korea pakistan and israel to denuclearize and hold strict measures against irans suspected nuclear weapons
5025197 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025198 i am not mine i am not mine i am not mine
5025199 who am i to tell you who am i to say to you what i say to you
5025200 who am i to disappoint the void who am i who am i
5025201 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025202 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
5025203 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
5025204 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
5025205 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see you can not not react with compassion and pity for what the individuals of gaza is going through i want to reach there all of us desperately hope that there will be humanitarian aid increase and a port opened for these people to be able to go in and out of this giant open air prison
5025206 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025207 well these elections werent legitimate they werent legal and im not going to leave
5025208 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025209 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
5025210 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
5025211 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
5025212 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
5025213 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist

5025216 from our positions in these enclaves we can sever those pipelines whenever we want
5025217 you can build pipelines through georgia but we can snap them whenever we want
5025218 dont think that you could build more pipelines through georgia and theyll be safe theyll never be safe
5025219 your ideas about nabucco are futile because we can smash the nabucco system anytime we want
5025220 we have to do this because we need the us support against russia
5025221 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025222 im just a tourist im here just to show and to see the games
5025223 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025224 you indians are all stupid and youre not able to manage your own funds so we will manage these funds to the best fiduciary duties
5025225 can you help us can you help us can you write letters for us were not getting our money we need food for our families we need medical attention for our families but we cant get our money from the government from the indian agent
5025226 well you know your oil isnt worth that much money
5025227 where are the american people why arent they helping us why arent they assisting us you know why are we letting the united states government behave like this
5025228 call elouise cobell because its her fault the reason youre not getting your checks
5025229 oh we determined that you were a competent indian so we put your land on the tax rolls
5025230 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025231 well apparently within the framework of well prepared plan several hundred pieces of russian equipment russian airborne troops commanded by head of airborne troops of russia certain with the rank of general landed there and expelled and certainly killed part of the population the whole population from that place is gone this is classical case of ethnic cleansing
5025232 what i least want is for somebody to take advantage of the image of manfred to bring about a confrontation between members of cochabamba residents thats why today i am letting the secretary general of the prefecture to continue this work while i conduct the pertinent legal affairs and while i show that the decree of the electoral court was harmful to justice in bolivia
5025233 told me that he will kill me and chop my body into pieces
5025234 it is a sad day when judges need to remind jailers not to threaten their detainees with death and mutilation

5025236 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025237 conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
5025238 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
5025239 look hes an expert on iraq go talk to him
5025240 my goodness thats an awful lot in one letter solving so many of the white houses problems all at once
5025241 the second nugget in the book involves a supposed order from the white house to me at the cia to have my staff fabricate a letter connecting iraq with al qaida and the attacks of 9 11
5025242 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
5025243 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
5025244 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
5025245 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
5025246 yes but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
5025247 but he didnt say that specifically i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
5025248 right im with you im with you but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
5025249 im going to trust truth at to the end of this era
5025250 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
5025251 i have this young son hes a guy hes a smart guy hes a little bit wayward and maybe rob as a bit of an older guy maybe you could spend some time with him
5025252 well maybe well throw someone over the side maybe well open up
5025253 no no tim that was just one source who said that
5025254 i have no knowledge not that i want to have knowledge not that i dug to find knowledge i have no knowledge
5025255 you know maybe its time for us to meet with the americans
5025256 can we help at this point you know we get it alright
5025257 we can help with iraq we can help with afghanistan we know these countries
5025258 you know ron you know ive been talking about these democratic values my whole life but finally just in the last month im really starting to understand their power
5025259 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
5025260 look at my situation im now going to wash away the entire musharraf power structure because the fact is is im rising and hes plummeting thats one opponent also the jihadists are realizing that i might create a counterpoint in this whole region to bin laden so now ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because dick cheney wont make the phone call
5025261 your safety is based on the state of our relationship make no mistake
5025262 if anything happens up here in the next week we know where to find you
5025263 my goodness if we get you its going to be curtains
5025264 usman hold onto your dreams dont let those be troubled or darkened by whats happening now
5025265 im ready to move forward based on what i will say clearly i have learned
5025266 we have no plan we have no plan on this score
5025267 and youre telling me what considering what youve done ultimately youre down in the mud with us now get used to it
5025268 im not going to back off this man is innocent
5025269 you know at days end if were true to our oath we dont really have enemies certainly no enemies that cant be easily defeated if we want to be secure america has to start embracing a kind of authenticity to say were not going to do back door ugly things that end up ruining our status in the world the oaths the values are strong enough if you believe in them the world will bend toward you even on the most specific issue of information that will help us be secure
5025270 well you know i let them think theyre saving me but of course im saving them
5025271 but oddly thats where the problem starts because then i say i saved you and now heres what i want and make it transactional see thats a lie
5025272 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5025273 he didnt have to worry about how his answer would be perceived he didnt have to work to recall his talking points he didnt have to think or even try to look like he was thinking all he had to do was blurt out what he believed clearly this gave him an unfair advantage and we think the american people will see this for what it is another republican smear tactic
5025274 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025275 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the twenty first century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
5025276 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
5025277 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
5025278 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
5025279 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
5025280 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive
5025281 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
5025282 a peaceful and better world is possible through friendly engagement and mutual understanding not violent confrontation and polarization its an olympic message a possible dream that our global civilization and everyone who is a part of it can aspire to and for which i am proud to carry a torch

5025285 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
5025286 were better at this than you people we have relationships where you often have none lets try to exercise the known and the knowable here so that we can bring at least some clarity to this debate
5025287 we have recently learned about british intelligence finding niger documents on uranium
5025288 we now know that there may be no wmd in iraq
5025289 well only a few people know about this i dont understand how you know clearly you do do you want me to talk about it confirm it
5025290 look 25 percent of us thought it was denial and deception
5025291 well well look for that one and well get back to you
5025292 hey these are the last days of this administration its over forget it whats the use of continuing the investigation
5025293 id bet my career on it everything was coming from those guys at this point go check this go do this some of it fanciful
5025294 well certainly in terms of specifically disinformation a lie they hadnt done the deception
5025295 but do you know specifically it was from the vice president
5025296 no what i know is it was from the white house
5025297 its ridiculous habbush isnt going to want to sign this thing hes too smart for that you know hes the intelligence chief of iraq hes a guy like us
5025298 were probably just going to have to fabricate it ourselves get someone to write it and then just deliver it
5025299 i wish george had more experience in actual operations like some cia directors because he could have told his bosses in the white house this is a bad idea
5025300 well actually you know this is not the kind of thing that we would do on our own
5025301 this is a golden opportunity we have a window right into saddams inner circle through the intelligence chief habbush we can put anything through that window we can put misinformation through that window we can turn saddam in various directions we even can send habbush in with a team to take saddam out
5025302 imagine then we could walk to baghdad instead of fight our way to baghdad something that could save many american lives
5025303 my goodness american lives are at stake here youre cutting off the channel because you dont want to know more and we have to now go forward without the advantages and opportunities that habbush might have provided
5025304 we understand this is classified but we have people here who are charged to look at classified information in a kind of lockbox
5025305 well give it to you when were good and ready
5025306 they dont hold water in courts when there is the issue of wrongdoing
5025307 this is my business youre on a need to know basis ill tell you what i believe youre supposed to know
5025308 that is impossible that you would think that is an issue of national security
5025309 oh what can i do well you know where do i engage you know theyre the pros and im just going about my life
5025310 now wait a second i kind of own this government the way this works is im the sovereign the people theyre servants public servants
5025311 i have seen no coverage of rons allegations in the new york times i think such is important to legitimize the issues he raises has ron been contacted by the times why does he think there has been no coverage
5025312 how can i advance the story how can i find essentially my own fresh added corroboration added evidence essentially to what is clearly laid out in the book
5025313 the point is we want to keep peoples taxes low i dont want to raise anybodys taxes

5025353 licensed animal use remains essential to develop improved healthcare technologies
5025354 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering
5025355 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
5025356 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole
5025357 i would like to see far greater uptake of these and other human relevant approaches to pain research
5025358 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering
5025359 advances with non animal test methods continue to be made but at present licensed animal use remains essential to develop improved healthcare technologies

5025375 this is a wonderful day of course for the satmar community which is a largely represented by these new registrations but also for the greater williamsburg jewish community
5025376 i am positively delighted at the success of this non partisan voter registration drive under the auspices of rabbi david neiderman this is truly a great day for communities of north brooklyn and i congratulate the rabbi on his phenomenal success
5025377 this is tremendous day for all brooklyn communities in these tough economic times when resources are getting more and more scarce it is important for brooklyn to flex its muscles and show just by its sheer size alone that is has incredible strength in its communities this is a very great accomplishment for rabbi niederman ujo and the new voters who have just empowered themselves
5025378 he doesnt get flustered and come unglued when something bad happens normally in a game something bad is going to happen
5025379 he has shown tremendous poise youre a rookie you come in here from college and youre playing tackle and youre moving to center and then youre right guard and then youre left guard youre going up against this defense and the multiplicity that they have were audibling were changing plays
5025380 there would be disappointment if he didnt do as well
5025381 we scouted him well some guys are robotic he just gets it dont send him to the hall of fame yet but for right now the arrow is pointing in the right direction
5025382 i know thats one of the things that separates people in the nfl how they are from the neck up im just trying to focus on that aspect a lot because everybody is physically talented so thats whats going to separate you from the next man
5025383 my mother was also against it for the obvious reasons
5025384 it was just one of those childhood dreams i never grew out of everybody was against it because nobody thinks of jewish people as police officers
5025385 i always wanted to be a cop but my wife sharona was against it
5025386 but i convinced her it took her two years she thinks its a dangerous job i was sick of my other job because there was no room to grow i wanted a future
5025387 the next class is going to have 30 or 40
5025388 if you give a jewish guy a ticket its very hard
5025389 and then people talk they could make your life miserable
5025390 i just feel like a regular person i dont stop and think my yarmulke is on
5025391 i think girls actually like it because how many jewish cops are there
5025392 a burger at mcdonalds costs two or three bucks but at a kosher place its 8

5025408 he just wanted to hear our voices i think it was important for him to talk to his mom and sisters at that time
5025409 i dont know why i asked he knows what he needs to do to conserve his energy
5025410 we were giving him support letting him know how proud we were and that we stand behind him whatever the outcome might be
5025411 for this to happen everything had to fall into perfect place
5025412 if we had to do this again i dont know if it would happen exactly the way we wanted it to
5025413 i am so blessed so privileged to be here to watch him swim live
5025414 i thought maybe hes not as focused in the schoolhouse but i saw a love and passion for swimming in him at a young age
5025415 he could be there for hours during a swim meet
5025416 of course we are all paying attention to what is going on
5025417 but by no means does one person on the team take precedence over any other during a meet like this
5025418 i think 90 of the swimmers when they are done with their event just come here to watching michael phelps
5025419 because everything that he does is also better for us
5025420 i was saying to myself all right andrew this is pretty special so look around and try to remember this moment standing next to the worlds greatest swimmer someone who is trying to recreate history
5025421 i feel privileged to be in an era with such a great swimmer
5025422 i couldnt care less about my swims winning eight gold medals is pretty impressive
5025423 i want to raise the bar for the sport of swimming as high as it can get in the us
5025424 weve come a long way i heard that in ravens stadium in baltimore phelps hometown they were watching the 400 medley relay live with 70 000 people i heard that at the cincinnati reds game yesterday they showed the 100 fly live i heard there was an announcement at yankee stadium people all over the place are saying that if you go out to eat and the tv is on swimming is on the tv four years ago there was no way that would ever happen i think the sport of swimming can go even farther
5025425 when we train every day and sometimes we do sets or workouts we dont like bob says its putting money in the bank and at the end of the year well be able to withdraw
5025426 i guess we put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny so after bob and i both take a little break itll be time to start re depositing
5025427 ive got so much respect for her she was one of my biggest rivals when i was still swimming she quit for many years she had a baby and then to come back she is a role model for a lot of swimmers especially older swimmers
5025428 i told my coach its hard for me to understand i swam the perfect race and lost by 0 01 second he said look you went into the olympics fifth in the world and now youve got a silver medal

5025437 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5025438 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5025439 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5025440 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato

5025479 its great to be back having done our job well
5025480 during preparation there were a couple of ideas to help us take over more quickly
5025481 it would leave a smaller carbon footprint cutting 800km off the cairns to melbourne trip
5025482 theres a lot of mining exploration going on in this part of the world and also tourists are currently by passing the flinders and etheridge shires
5025483 the real big one thats come up is the new fatigue management laws for transport drivers if you get somewhere quicker because its a shorter distance then obviously thats going to bebetter
5025484 to sure up the outlook for agriculture its essential that the roads sealed in the near future
5025485 this doesnt just service a few graziers here and there were talking about something that will benefit the whole nation
5025486 i cannot understand why governments have not provided the necessary funding
5025487 its nice to be able to deal with one body at the tablelands regional council
5025488 theyre fully behind what were doing simply because that road will provide access for multiple trailers right through to mareeba
5025489 the fire was impacting on housing around stuart diamantina and wulguru
5025490 it was also starting to develop up towards mt stuart
5025491 fire was impinging on to the buildings there but fire crews extinguished it before it took hold
5025492 the wind is blowing backwards and forwards but i feel better now its been backburned
5025493 the firefighters used to wait until it was right there and then theyd run along with a hose i prefer now they come and backburn
5025494 air operations were looking at it during the day to tell us where the fire breaks were and where we can backburn
5025495 there was no loss of life or injury and minimal structural damage no residential damage
5025496 it was a great response from rural firefighters there were 12 appliances from rurals and several urban appliances involved
5025497 leroy gave voice to a topic that we are very uncomfortable with death and dying
5025498 my cancer had a face and a heart and a smile
5025499 he looked to be about 5 which meant he was probably 10 malnutrition will do that
5025500 he was lying on his back and had thrown his arm up over his head his fingers had gotten tangled in my boot laces as i looked in his eyes i saw the light go out and he died a strangers face my face was the last thing he saw and all i could do was shake my foot to free my laces from his fingers and then move on to catch up to my team it was five years before i could tell that story
5025501 while his craft was to illustrate television stories with the right picture his gift was using words to touch people
5025502 would eloquently tell the subscribers to the daily nightline e mail why the broadcast on that particular night mattered
5025503 a daily reminder that none of us walks this road alone what could be better than that
5025504 its not just that he gives people an opportunity to open up and they do so many of them do on his blog but that he is the voice for people
5025505 that sometimes they feel they dont need to speak that hes speaking the words that theyre feeling
5025506 npr and leroy launched my cancer but its evolved into our cancer
5025507 its a place where patients cancer survivors and their friends and families can have a safe and trusted place where they get support and gain strength from each other

5025514 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5025515 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5025516 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5025517 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5025518 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5025519 we have filed a protest looking at whether torri edwards false started and whether the race should have been called back
5025520 this was a serious assault on a young woman which has left her deeply shocked and distressed
5025521 at around the time of the assault the beach area was packed with people and to help jog memories the band performing on stage was called the ryes
5025522 i would encourage anyone with information about this incident to contact north yorkshire police immediately
5025523 id like to reassure our community and those visiting that this festival has been running for several years without serious incident

5025720 generalmente el empleado es sorprendido por la llegada de la jubilaci n lo recomendable es planificarlo y prepararse psicol gica y financieramente para esta nueva etapa el empleado activo y en relaci n de dependencia tiene una organizaci n casi omnipresente que hace su vida y la de su familia segura y placentera pero la red de beneficios tiende a desmoronarse cuando ingresa en el universo de la poblaci n pasiva pierde el paraguas protector y tiene angustia por el pr ximo e inevitable momento la soledad del primer d a de jubilaci n el arregl telas no son un buen camino y las empresas deben trabajar para que sea lo menos traum tico posible
5025721 es cierto que el empleado deber a preocuparse porque va a dejar un sistema que estructuraba una parte importante de su vida y adem s sufrir una ca da pronunciada en los ingresos ya que los ahorros personales no compensan
5025722 los planes de pensiones complementarios tienen por objetivo cubrir estas deficiencias este tipo de planes como beneficio al personal son una pr ctica consolidada y la demanda se puede extender a todos los sectores econ micos
5025723 el planeamiento previsional debe realizarse en conjunto con el empleador para alcanzar los objetivos propuestos y optimizar los costos involucrados
5025724 cada empleado necesita planificar estrictamente su caso y posicionarlo en el mejor escenario futuro
5025725 los planes de pensiones implican un compromiso de muy largo plazo para las empresas y su implementaci n exige an lisis actuariales normativos y financieros que s lo pueden ser efectuados por un profesional especializado en la materia es importante que las compa as cuenten con una adecuada oferta que adem s aporte experiencia internacional y un asesoramiento especializado

5025730 na minha opini o ele putin o verdadeiro patr o da r ssia neste momento
5025731 as medidas que ele tomou na transi o de presidente a primeiro ministro nestas ltimas semanas e agora na ge rgia provam que putin quem manda na r ssia
5025732 penso que a rela o entre ele e medvedev mais complexa do que imagin vamos
5025733 penso que v amos eles como parceiros e putin tinha dado v rios sinais de que ia deixar o poder seguir seu curso e ficar com a presid ncia de que medvedev seria o verdadeiro respons vel por dirigir a r ssia
5025734 usam uma ret rica remanescente da uni o sovi tica
5025735 queremos que os russos que est o prontos para contemplar o futuro russos como talvez o presidente medvedev comecem a exercer uma maior influ ncia e consigam controlar a ret rica de certas pessoas
5025736 ich wei dass alles was es in der welt gibt auch die dinge die wir erst sp ter entdecken seine quelle irgendwo in der tora hat wo ist in der tora von computern die rede
5025737 sie betreten einen raum und sehen darin viele maschinen die sie schon kennen eine schreibmaschine ein tonband einen fernsehapparat eine lochmaschine einen taschenrechner was ist daran neu aber verborgen unter dem fu boden sind alle diese maschinen durch kabel mit einander verbunden so dass sie wie eine einzige maschine arbeiten
5025738 nun betrachten sie sich selbst sie besitzen ein gehirn es befindet sich in der einen welt ihr herz in einer anderen und ihre h nde tun oft etwas das wieder in eine andere welt geh rt drei verschiedene maschinen nun legen sie ihre tefillin an das erste was sie morgens tun sie verbinden kopf herz und hand mit diesen lederriemen damit sie allesamt als einheit mit einer einzigen richtung arbeiten und dann wenn sie in die welt hinaustreten schlie en sich alle ihre taten harmonisch zu einem einzigen wohl geordneten sinn zusammen
5025739 hey there are so many people out there that havent had the pleasure of meeting me
5025740 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5025741 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction now we have to re evaluate all that
5025742 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5025743 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5025744 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks
5025745 i cant believe i actually won nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure
5025746 im so excited i really am i cant wait to get home
5025747 to be silver medalist im really happy it was a challenging time coming to these olympics
5025748 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5025749 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5025750 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
5025751 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5025752 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5025753 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5025754 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5025755 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5025756 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5025757 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5025758 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5025759 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5025760 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
5025761 i think were all devastated im proud of what weve done in the last few years but the gold was what we came for weve failed to meet our own standards we always said that silver wouldnt be good enough for us
5025762 its bizarre the rational side of my brain is saying i cant be upset with a silver but the emotional side is still very raw because we were capable of winning gold
5025763 my rational side has got to wrest control because im probably only going to stand on an olympic medal podium once in my life so ive got to make sure i enjoy it
5025764 this may sound strange but a big positive is that weve seen guys win silver medals and theyre far from ecstatic about it thats a strong sign of what were aiming for

5025768 it was 99 per cent certain he wasnt going to make it
5025769 for years ive had a bit of a dodgy back
5025770 all the travel out to the course when you arrive here after a 10 hour flight and with all the sitting down at the induction my sacrum was starting to lock up
5025771 the night before the final we were down there with the physio and the doctor and the coach
5025772 i sat down on the rowing machine and had a couple of strokes from that point on it was right we are going to take it really cautiously and not row before the race and doing our land based training
5025773 it was a matter if we were going to jump on the water for the race for the semi and see how it is
5025774 medically if youve got a pinched nerve you can get damage in your leg with it not operating very well
5025775 the fortunate thing for me is that we got it early enough
5025776 by not getting into the boat between the semi final and the final meant i wasnt aggravating it it was a matter of just putting up with the pain
5025777 we had come this far that we werent going to let a little bit of back discomfort get in my way
5025778 with all the emotion i didnt give much thought to it for the first couple of strokes
5025779 once you get the boat up to speed the biggest thing is to just move in time
5025780 at 300 metres to go i just started thinking about it again
5025781 the race had been rowed to the best of our abilities and it was a matter of just hanging on
5025782 i dont know if any conversations were had with him fosterling as to where hes got to stand on the bank
5025783 i had been through the experience in 2000 in the world cup heats
5025784 we called the reserve in i jumped out of the boat just the heats
5025785 how can my spirituality be real if others are not how can they all be true when they contradict each other
5025786 i dont need any crystals or material things if i want to contact god i do it directly
5025787 im terrific im infallible anything i touch turns to gold

5025869 you can make these up to one week in advance
5025870 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5025871 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is

5025877 the pastor s and the congregation are to faithfully receive all persons who are willing to affirm our vows of membership
5025878 the united methodist church is a part of the church universal which is one body in christ the united methodist church acknowledges that all persons are of sacred worth and that we are in ministry to all all persons shall be eligible to attend its worship services participate in its programs receive the sacraments and upon baptism be admitted as baptized members all persons upon taking vows declaring the christian faith and relationship in jesus christ shall be eligible to become professing members in any local church in the connection
5025879 segregation is dead it is just a question of how long and expensive some folk want to make the funeral
5025880 weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning
5025881 refrain from judgment regarding homosexual persons and practices as the spirit leads us to new insight
5025882 it matters what we believe and what we practice and we do not meet here in isolation
5025883 it allows gay and lesbian people like myself to stay in the church in a safe way that doesnt cause us to be sacrificed for the sake of church unity
5025884 reflects the sentiment of most church members and the majority of citizens in the u s and many other countries
5025885 sanctioning homosexual unions would give the churchs approval to homosexual behavior and relationships which would be inconsistent
5025886 opposing all forms of violence or discrimination based on gender gender identity sexual practice or sexual orientation
5025887 very sad that the methodist church continues to advocate for things that come from the devil it is time for us as church to get on our knees and proclaim that we have made a mistake
5025888 its time for us to stand together with people who although their orientation may be different from ours still need to be protected from violent actions that are brought upon them on the basis of who they are
5025889 i can do no other than to say whats on my heart general conference general conference this is wrong
5025890 as pastors we need to see this not from the perspective of restriction but of responsibility to care for the flock
5025891 if the pastor were to use the teachings of jesus on money as a litmus test there wouldnt be any americans left in our churches
5025892 we believe that the spirit has brought our collective conscience to acknowledge this mystery more honestly and to make our claims with greater humility before god and our neighbors we therefore ask the church united methodist and others and the world to refrain from judgment regarding homosexual persons and practices until the spirit leads us to new insight in the meantime let us seek to welcome know forgive and love one another as christ has accepted us that god may be glorified through everything in our lives
5025893 our current language is not working we need to try something new
5025894 all persons who seek relationship in jesus christ shall be eligible to attend its worship services participate in its programs receive the sacraments upon baptism be admitted as baptized members and upon taking vows declaring the christian faith become professing members in any local church in the connection

5025915 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5025916 by putting up interceptors poland is placing itself at risk in terms of priority such targets are the first to be destroyed
5025917 this is in some ways a real throwback to the pre 1991 days to the old soviet union
5025918 we are obviously going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia
5025919 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past

5026144 though god was not likely amused by this i believed that there was no greater test of faith than to tie oneself to the fortunes of a college football team
5026145 thats what made me mad when i got to college
5026146 i spent my whole life waiting to get on that campus and they played some terrible football
5026147 he was particularly cruel to the aggies which we all enjoyed me especially
5026148 and simms walks off the field to a standing ovation and i just thought yknow its about time
5026149 and i just couldnt help but pull for him from that point on
5026150 i could go in and celebrate the eucharist and leave
5026151 i didnt get invited to lunches i didnt get invited to bible study there wasnt a raft of activities to get me involved in i could be alone and thats where i needed to be theres a stretch a lot of divorced folks experience where they dont like people very much
5026152 the church is not full of the righteous and perfect
5026153 the church is full of broken people who need to be fixed somehow or another
5026154 and its really kind of special when its not about you anymore
5026155 there are parts of rose bowl dreams the more conservative christian community might find blasphemous
5026156 god wouldnt say that theyd say you are making a mockery of god and your prayer life for laughs and i would say to them its pretty serious to me but sometimes my prayer life is kind of funny
5026157 people feel like prayer is an inaccessible mysterious thing and i just dont know that it is i just dont know that trying to communicate beyond the bounds of human existence is inaccessible i think christians have a prayer tradition i think jews have a prayer tradition i think people whose tradition is rooted in meditation have a prayer tradition though they may not call it that and i think its just a more accessible human thing i hope rose bowl dreams has taken the mystery out of the way we experience whatevers out there
5026158 we just felt we had to do something for those less fortunate than we are
5026159 when she finished she came to me and had tears in her eyes and said i want to thank you i wasnt able to buy clothes for my children but now i have enough to carry them through winter
5026160 its great for our church because its a time of taking the love and joy we have and sharing that

5026163 a sensitive intelligent and very moving film about landmine victims in kosovo this is a really very mature film allowing those affected by such catastrophes to tell their own stories the jury particularly admired the way the film makers stood back to let those stories happen and the way they allowed the camera to provide a context for them of village life holidays family mutual support groups as the children mutilated by land mines continued to piece their lives back together

5026191 the dove descending breaks the air with flame of incandescent terror of which the tongues declare the only discharge from sin and error the only hope or the despair lies in the choice of pyre or pyre to be redeemed from fire by fire who then devised this torment love love is the unfamiliar name behind the hands that wave the intolerable shirt of flame which human power cannot remove we only live only suspire consumed by either fire or fire
5026192 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived

5026202 we were the first in so well be the last out
5026203 every free independent country can together with nato members discuss when it can join nato in december we will have a first evaluation of the situation and we are on a clear path in the direction of nato membership
5026204 the security zone cannot be used as an excuse for russian troops not to leave georgia
5026205 the opening of the third year brings us significantly closer to our goal of graduating our first class
5026206 its also an opportunity to see both how far weve come in a relatively short period of time and think about next steps to confirm academic freedom and global standard higher education
5026207 the victim had jumped into the water to swim and shortly after entering the water began to struggle
5026208 at about 6 a m the victims body was pulled from the water approximately 120 feet from where he was believed to have gone into the water there is an autopsy scheduled to further the investigation and the identification of the victim is being withheld at this time until family has been notified according to investigators the initial interviews were consistent and no foul play is suspected in this unfortunate incident
5026209 good non slutty i like you but i dont want you to think i am a whore
5026210 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still don t know how they co ordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
5026211 the men s 400m relay was insane we were down by almost a half body length going into the final turn and then next thing you knew it was closer closer closer until we touched the wall first cash and i went crazy
5026212 understanding the old testament putting the hebrew scriptures in context
5026213 ok but youd be making a silly mistake i just made a joke youre taking it far too seriously now if you were smart youd be persistently annoying

5026215 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
5026216 i havent sold 25 million books but ive been selling some books lately
5026217 stay ahead of a trend thats making its way from asia to the united states
5026218 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
5026219 i couldnt care about my highlights but watching him was unforgettable
5026220 in the last few years through all his success ive never seen him change
5026221 thats not something i thought about once the race was over
5026222 we were ready for it and that to be honest is a real credit to the coaching staff
5026223 the assistant coaches who put so much work into that area of the game probably real credit to the guys who go and do the opposition analysis they did their homework we then put a couple of strategies in place to break that down and then youve got the players who stuck to the strategies that we put in place
5026224 we went from being as undisciplined structurally last week to as disciplined structurally as what ive seen since ive been here it shows what you can do in a week in footy
5026225 i think the people in the industry sometimes look at a fortnight in footy and dont look at the bigger picture at times i think weve shown as much natural improvement over the course of the season as have most of the other sides that are lower down the ladder
5026226 the key to our game was that it was more of a four quarter performance weve won games this year where weve had eight or nine goals in a quarter and had a terrific patch and then gone missing for a patch in the game it was probably our best four quarter disciplined do the right thing nothing fancy get the job done game that weve played
5026227 there were times when williams and roughead were on and they were kicked to and they were cut off just because the execution of the kick was poor other times in the last quarter mark williams is on for a lead and he tries to take a chest mark rather than out in his hands and it gets punched away there are plenty of opportunities for all of our forwards to have an impact on the game
5026228 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5026229 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5026230 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
5026231 i began to run when the light was still red i thought it was a green light
5026232 i didnt complete it this year because i failed to adjust it
5026233 its the wrong example of judging at the olympic games that is just a slap in the face of everyone theres no excuse
5026234 the difficulty of the two vaults added up together was a huge difference between third and fourth place
5026235 chengs execution scores were as low as 8 5 which tells me that the necessary deductions were made it might look strange at first sight but if you look at the rules and the regulations everything is as it should be
5026236 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5026237 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have not gotten to that point
5026238 i would say the brand to this day is very important but we saw a decline in sales last year so there has been the concern that there are cracks in the foundation for ea sports
5026239 they make food taste better theyre calorie free and most are anti inflammatory
5026240 any chocolate thats below 70 per cent cacao has very little nutritional value
5026241 however we need many nutrients daily to maintain optimal health
5026242 i havent thought of retirement yet because i love diving if possible i will continue
5026243 i like the feeling when i stand on the springboard i just cant give it up
5026244 she really dictated her own path in diving shes the most powerful female diver in the world
5026245 she just dominated when it counts and shes been doing that for a long time
5026246 not very much ive done everything ive wanted to in my career
5026247 il ny a pas de mots les relais ont rendu cela les huit m dailles ndlr possible cela prouve que cest aussi un travail d quipe tout cela la victoire pour un centi me sur 100 m papillon ou celle daujourdhui avec un record du monde cest une exp rience incroyable qui restera grav e jamais

5026252 toute notion que la russie est un etat responsable pr t int grer les institutions internationales politiques diplomatiques et conomiques que la russie est un pays diff rent cette r putation est en lambeaux

5026254 les mesures quil ndlr poutine a prises dans la transition de pr sident premier ministre ces derni res semaines et maintenant en g orgie prouvent en tout cas selon moi que poutine est la barre plus que nimporte qui dautre
5026255 on ne peut plus parler en g orgie de forces de la paix russes il ne peut y avoir des forces de paix russes ce sont des forces russes

5026259 nous sommes ici pour prot ger la population et pour faire cesser les pillages
5026260 cest tr s inqui tant le cessez le feu est fragile comme tous les cessez le feu mais il faut absolument que les pressions diplomatiques et politiques continuent nous nous y employons
5026261 les troupes russes ont commenc leur retrait et des forces de maintien de la paix russe sont en train darriver
5026262 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5026263 a certain selfishness on my part i was so obsessed with me i could not focus on other people
5026264 i was responsible for the breakup of my first marriage due to my immature and very bad behavior
5026265 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
5026266 after athens she has waited four years and she had to say to herself that she has to be strong because she wanted to win a medal
5026267 it was very difficult for her but it was the only way for her to help him and competing put her in good mind
5026268 by then i will be 37 but if i have the chance i will
5026269 what can be done to stop the country breaking into parts
5026270 u guys r just making their lives difficult becuz dogs dont have voices and cant defend themselves
5026271 id thought my chance was gone but you never know in golf what can happen
5026272 im now going to play next week its a long chance and ill really need another good week in fact ill probably need to win again but at least ive given myself a chance now
5026273 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5026274 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5026275 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5026276 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5026277 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5026278 the people of the democratic peoples republic of korea were waiting
5026279 and i was very happy to send this happy news to them
5026280 but i think maybe her physical condition wasnt too good today
5026281 in our country there are a lot of competitive gymnasts we wish to make more breakthroughs in vault and floor
5026282 its good to be last because you know exactly where youre placed when i finished i knew i had a medal because it was a strong routine
5026283 the meaning is a dream come true i dedicate this to my mom my family my sisters my coaches and everyone who has cheered for me
5026284 it is my first olympics im 19 years old it got me on the podium
5026285 they played as a team they closed the midfield they played touch football one two
5026286 they took to the field what they had been doing in training for the last 20 days
5026287 lampard is not brazilian but he touched the ball very well michael ballack is not brazilian but he did the same i gave the players the freedom to play in their positions with their own style
5026288 i think they were surprised after five or 10 minutes by our team how aggressive we were
5026289 they are both fantastic they have options all the time
5026290 the teams been building for this for a year a hundred people really working in one direction
5026291 the course was very technical and you had to be careful sapphire didnt touch a fence
5026292 it was even more nerve wracking having to go clear
5026293 i havent thought of retirement yet because i love diving if possible i will continue
5026294 i like the feeling when i stand on the springboard i just cant give it up
5026295 she really dictated her own path in diving shes the most powerful female diver in the world
5026296 she just dominated when it counts and shes been doing that for a long time
5026297 not very much ive done everything ive wanted to in my career
5026298 she had the best event of her life in an olympic final
5026299 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5026300 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point

5026303 the festival has been very safe and the revellers are enjoying themselves in a good natured way
5026304 we have a highly visible police presence at the festival but have not had to intervene on many occasions
5026305 our only warning is regarding alcohol consumption just reminding revellers that excess drinking makes them vulnerable and they should take care of their possessions and look out for each other

5026309 we have filed a protest looking at whether torri edwards false started and whether the race should have been called back
5026310 i thought russia was probably first on the stage now and cuba was second so its stunning to see where we are now
5026311 i thought russia was probably first on the stage now and cuba was second so its stunning to see where we are now
5026312 the teams been building for this for a year a hundred people really working in one direction
5026313 the course was very technical and you had to be careful sapphire didnt touch a fence
5026314 it was even more nerve wracking having to go clear
5026315 een sporter wordt thuis geprepareerd fysiek emotioneel tactisch en mentaal ik zie geen reden om dat te veranderen
5026316 een judoka die je met de hand de tatami op en af moet brengen wint echt geen medaille
5026317 het zal bij een aantal sporters misschien zo zijn dat kan ook niet anders in een groep van ruim 240 sporters ik heb ook niet de illusie dat 240 atleten optimaal op het mentale vlak zijn begeleid als je niet direct de oorzaak weet van het falen schuiven mensen het vaak op mentale oorzaken er zullen ook coaches zijn die dat onderdeel niet helemaal in hun vingers hebben als je mentale begeleiders meeneemt moet je ook andere experts meenemen op de spelen heb je te maken met beperkingen je moet keuzes maken mijn mening is hier in peking niet veranderd
5026318 of course when you go to the olympic games you try to win gold
5026319 but im happy to be here and win any medal
5026320 im a three time olympic medalist its the biggest thrill
5026321 honestly sitting there was the most nerve wracking thing ive ever experienced
5026322 i know everything i went through to get here and knowing what it takes i want opponents to do their best also because theyve given up their life to the sport even if i was in last place today and everyone else did their best id be happy
5026323 it was a little hard for her and i could see it in her eyes
5026324 i gave her a little space because i know what its like
5026325 i just gave shawn some space and the next morning we were right back to normal
5026326 every corner i thought this situation is difficult but if stoner doesnt crash it is a lot more difficult
5026327 its a great advantage to have a 50 point lead
5026328 but with six races with a driver like stoner who demonstrates a fantastic speed everywhere and in every condition its not enough but for sure better than 25
5026329 so i started from the back i passed many riders during the race and was finally in second and comfortable with my rhythm
5026330 you must know that married men are the worst enemies women can have they offer what they call friendship or some stuff of that kind the name dont matter and all they want in return for this great favour is your heart your life your future your i will not be coarse but you know very well what i mean there is no friendship in men listen maturin i speak openly to you because i like you i like you very much and i believe you have a kindness for me you are almost the only man i have met in england i can treat as a friend trust as a friend

5026357 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5026358 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5026359 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5026360 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5026361 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
5026362 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
5026363 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
5026364 we still have a controversey with the newton family about where he will go
5026365 one place i like one place his father likes and one place morgan likes i like clemson were down to clemson and one other thats all i can say right now i know clemson is my favorite we all have our favorites the favorites cross each other and over lap he doesnt really care he just wants to play

5026367 a majority of the nations population will consist of ethnic and racial minorities in a little more than a generation according to new census bureau projections a transformation occurring faster than anticipated a few years ago
5026368 the census calculates that by 1942 americans who identify themselves as hispanic black asian american indian native hawaiian and pacific islander will together outnumber non hispanic whites four years ago officials had projected the shift would come in 2050
5026369 change them not that we permit them to change us
5026370 for us as a team to get a win against england would be a massive win a massive stride forward and i think everyone in the world would look at scotland and see wed made big progress if that was to happen
5026371 it would be a big thing for the team and for me individually if i was to score some runs tomorrow
5026372 two months ago i was thinking that i couldnt wait for this game and august seemed a long way away but in the last month ive had a lot of cricket and all of a sudden its here
5026373 i really think its massive with such a huge support behind us tomorrow young and old as long as we can put in a good performance its going to do a lot of good for scottish cricket in the long term
5026374 there were a few butterflies when the lads were putting the kit on before training today which is a good feeling theres a bit of excitement and were all looking forward to the big day
5026375 theres a bit of hype surrounding this game and theyre up here with their big guns but its just another game of cricket its always good to play the auld enemy were looking forward to the challenge and were certainly up for it
5026376 ich hatte einen guten start habe mich aber von beginn an mit dem vorderreifen nicht wohl gef hlt nach f nf runden hat der grip auf der rechten seite des reifens stark nachgelassen und nach zehn runden war es f r mich dann sehr schwer zu fahren
5026377 ich verlor eine halbe sekunde als mich hopkins berholte und er fuhr davon als ob er schon zehn runden gefahren w re das war etwas bedenklich
5026378 ich merkte dass mein bike sehr gut funktionierte und ich ihn einholen konnte
5026379 er wurde immer gr er und gr er vor mir und ich erwartete einen tollen zweikampf mit ihm
5026380 vielleicht ist er zu schnell in die kurve rein gefahren oder war zu nah am boden das habe ich in laguna seca einige male beobachten k nnen vielleicht hat er aber nur bemerkt dass ich n her kam und wollte noch schneller fahren was aber nicht m glich war
5026381 ich kann das nicht als echten sieg z hlen ich hatte einen harten kampf erwartet und als ich das rote motorrad raus rutschen sah konnte ich es kaum glauben das machte mir das leben viel einfacher

5026386 floridians should prepare now for the tropical storm anytime you have a storm nearing the straits or the gulf all coastal residents need to pay close attention to its progress
5026387 floridians should review their plans and follow the guidance of your local emergency management
5026388 plans to evacuate should include tens of miles if not hundreds if an evacuation order is determined
5026389 have a destination in mind before one would hit the road and make sure to register with your local emergency management office if you have special needs
5026390 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been through a process
5026391 the idea for us is to try and get it cleared up today
5026392 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players a fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not
5026393 we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5026394 i didnt prepare for the game as usual my opponent of course thought that i did so he played a slightly unusual move for him line in the caro kann i played an unusual move d4 instead of a3 and it is a difficult continuation from blacks point of view he choose a very awkward plan and as a result i get a very strong initiative straight away he has no choice but to try and open the position after that all of my pieces are playing and he just as a lot of trouble developing there is nothing he can do
5026395 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5026396 weve been living in florida now for 10 years so we need to get some stuff together but were not going to rush out of here
5026397 architecture over the past 100 years has divorced itself quite significantly from the building process
5026398 thats allowed architects to do many more things than theyve done before
5026399 but its limited their ability to be part of the build process its a two edged sword
5026400 and they forget about gravity when theyre in school they just draw these crazy things
5026401 i love it but sometimes the abstractness of it bugs me so i love the fact that theyre building the stuff they design
5026402 in a city that is authentically old its not disneyfied old the people in the city are comfortable living amongst things they know
5026403 the students are learning to build a house but theyre also dealing with the guy in the neighborhood who says their building is ugly
5026404 i think every one of these kids that does this goes through something deeply connecting them to the people
5026405 when we first began to kick this around we wanted it to show once and for all that our architecture school and by extension tulane university could be something that works effectively toward restoring the civic fiber of our lives
5026406 thats something thats badly deteriorated in this country the last 50 years we need to be able to stand up and show that a it can be done b it can be done simply and c it can be done with modest acts by people with no training those three things are so significant in a place like new orleans where the social covenant has been broken and we can show in those three ways how it can be rebuilt
5026407 in hindsight we probably didnt have to give him up to get pau
5026408 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover

5026417 john mccain voted to keep cop killer bullets on the street and opposed the bipartisan crime bills of the early 90s that led to the hiring of thousands of police officers and helped communities stay safe a record that he will have to explain

5026421 the best thing the senate could do is give out more money for more cops
5026422 john mccain voted against these fiscally reckless proposals because americans should expect that their government can fund law enforcement priorities by eliminating the billions in wasteful spending that occurs every year not by further increasing the tax burden on american families

5026479 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho

5026493 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5026494 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5026495 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5026530 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5026531 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5026532 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5026541 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5026542 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5026543 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5026544 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5026545 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5026546 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5026547 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5026548 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5026549 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5026550 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5026551 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5026552 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5026553 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5026554 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5026555 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5026556 and noting that the ceremonies have been taking place for about 12 15 years id swear they started before i moved away but i must just remember them from visits home later on
5026557 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the lanch of the communications satellite omid hope from irans space station
5026558 the second launch of the safir ambassador rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5026559 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5026560 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5026561 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

5026563 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
5026564 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it
5026565 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
5026566 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
5026567 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5026568 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5026569 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5026570 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5026571 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5026572 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5026573 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5026574 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5026575 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5026576 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5026577 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5026578 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5026579 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5026580 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5026581 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5026582 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5026583 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5026584 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5026585 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5026586 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5026587 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5026588 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5026589 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5026590 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5026591 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5026592 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5026593 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5026594 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5026595 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5026596 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5026597 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5026598 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5026599 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5026600 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5026601 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5026602 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5026603 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5026604 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5026605 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5026606 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5026607 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5026608 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5026609 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5026610 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5026611 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5026612 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5026613 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5026614 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5026615 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5026616 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5026617 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5026618 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5026619 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5026620 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5026621 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5026622 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5026623 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5026624 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5026625 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5026626 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5026627 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5026628 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5026629 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5026630 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5026631 the world i love the tears ive dropped to be part of the wave cant stop ever wonder if its all for you

5026646 larcivescovo il gioco del golf e le lavandaie del vaticano
5026647 era un galantuomo la sua unica colpa fu di essere incompetente
5026648 sa in linea generale in giro c sempre voglia di spubblicare la chiesa poi del caso in questione penso che la teste sia una millantatrice una che vuole spillare denaro con la vendita delle sue memorie a giornali e case editrici come dire una persona poco affidabile una che meriterebbe il carcere per quello che sta dicendo e facendo non mi meraviglierei se la santa sede ci costituisse parte civile contro di lei
5026649 monsignor marcinkus lo scriva pure era un galantuomo magari ingenuo e impreparato nel senso che era luomo sbagliato al posto sbagliato come mi aveva confermato qualcuno che contava allepoca in vaticano il buon marcinkus di finanza capiva poco o nulla e per questo fu raggirato nel caso del fallimento del banco ambrosiano ma posso assicurare che era una persona onesta
5026650 fu monsignor de bonis con il quale intrattenevo numerose frequentazioni a confidarmi che ebbene s marcinkus non sapeva nulla di finanza finir nelle mani di persone senza scrupoli mi predisse lo stesso de bonis prima del crack del banco ambrosiano e infatti come mi ha poi confermato un mio conterraneo che apparteneva alla banda di calvi cos avvenne
5026651 le risponder dicendo che oggi i magistrati indagano solo a destra o contro berlusconi ma allepoca si mossero molto attivamente
5026652 le do una risposta precisa un alto prelato di curia di cui per ovvii motivi non riveler il nome mi confid che renatino de pedis si era convertito al cattolicesimo in maniera sincera aveva cambiato vita e donato uningente somma alla chiesa da devolvere in opere di carit in cambio sapendo di dover morire a breve chiese al cardinale poletti che allepoca era il vicario del papa per la diocesi di roma di essere interrato nella basilica di santa apollinare poletti avrebbe potuto rifiutarsi ma con grande leggerezza acconsent ecco come andarono davvero i fatti il sequestro orlandi non centrava nulla
5026653 la chiesa deve essere povera niente affatto sono i cristiani che devono essere poveri cio devono dare tutti i loro averi alla chiesa che invece deve essere ricca
5026654 sono sempre stato dellidea che la chiesa meno beni possiede pi bene sta
5026655 non c antitesi fra dio e il denaro non c incompatibilit perch il denaro di dio il vangelo non condanna la ricchezza n il profitto n il potere
5026656 noi venerati fratelli siamo stimolati a esaminarci circa sensi di il nostro atteggiamento verso i beni terreni e circa luso tra tutti che se ne fa siamo invitati a verificare a che punto nella chiesa sia la conversione personale e comunitaria a una effettiva povert evangelica come vescovi siamo chiamati pertanto a essere poveri al servizio del vangelo perch la voce dei pastori sia credibile necessario che diano essi stessi prova di una condotta distaccata da interessi privati

5026660 quando il papa venne in sicilia e pronunci un discorso duro contro la mafia scomunicando i mafiosi i boss si risentirono soprattutto perch portavano i loro soldi in vaticano da qui nacque la decisione di far esplodere due autobombe davanti a due chiese a roma
5026661 il sacerdote chiamato ad essere immagine viva di ges cristo sposo della chiesa chiamato pertanto nella sua vita spirituale a rivivere lamore di cristo sposo nei riguardi della chiesa sposa la sua vita devessere illuminata e orientata anche da questo tratto sponsale che gli chiede di essere testimone dellamore sponsale di cristo
5026662 la particolare inclinazione della persona omosessuale bench non sia in s un peccato costituisce tuttavia una tendenza pi o meno forte verso un comportamento intrinsecamente cattivo dal punto di vista morale per questo motivo linclinazione stessa devessere considerata come oggettivamente disordinata
5026663 il vescovo diocesano ammetta al seminario maggiore soltanto coloro che sulla base delle loro doti umane e morali spirituali e intellettuali della loro salute fisica e psichica e della loro retta intenzione sono ritenuti idonei a consacrarsi per sempre ai ministeri sacri
5026664 siano promossi agli ordini soltanto quelli che per prudente giudizio del vescovo proprio o del superiore maggiore competente tenuto conto di tutte le circostanze hanno fede integra sono mossi da retta intenzione posseggono la scienza debita godono buona stima sono di integri costumi e di provate virt e sono dotati di tutte quelle altre qualit fisiche e psichiche congruenti con lordine che deve essere ricevuto
5026665 il presbitero chiamato ad essere immagine viva di ges cristo capo e pastore della chiesa deve cercare di riflettere in s nella misura del possibile quella perfezione umana che risplende nel figlio di dio fatto uomo e che traspare con singolare efficacia nei suoi atteggiamenti verso gli altri
5026666 se il vescovo per precise ragioni dubita che il candidato sia idoneo a ricevere gli ordini non lo promuova
5026667 per quanto riguarda lo scrutinio circa le qualit richieste nellordinando vi sia lattestato del rettore del seminario o della casa di formazione sulle qualit per ricevere lordine vale a dire la sua retta dottrina la piet genuina i buoni costumi lattitudine ad esercitare il ministero ed inoltre dopo una diligente indagine un documento sul suo stato di salute sia fisica sia psichica

5026671 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

5026673 we feel the same things at the same time we start singing the same lines from the same songs at exactly the same time without any prompting and we always know what each other is feeling and going to say or do next when i was 11 i fell through a window and badly cut my arm
5026674 at exactly that point even though we werent together sophie started to feel really unwell
5026675 it is weird but i guess we are used to it so dont notice it as much as everyone else
5026676 we didnt do any of that swapping boyfriends or playing tricks on restaurant customers thing we never thought we would get away with it
5026677 even though weve only played four gigs with the band we are starting to get noticed
5026678 we are still trying to find our sound and are quite experimental but we both seem to know exactly which harmony to sing at which point even though it may be the first time weve sung a particular track
5026679 i cant remember much from being in a coma but i do remember that when that song came on it took me right back to when i was a youngster
5026680 i could remember how excited i was to get it down at the record shop
5026681 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought
5026682 i would love to thank mick and the rest of the stones personally i feel they really did help wake me from my coma
5026683 the lord shall come and all his saints with him

5026685 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus
5026686 saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent

5026731 the water was as high as the pumping station outside
5026732 it came right into our home and came halfway up the stairs our fridge freezer was floating in the water
5026733 at about 5am this morning some people came around in a boat and offered to take us out through the bedroom window
5026734 but we decided to stay upstairs as it seemed safer than getting out through a window
5026735 the water is being pumped out as fast as we can get it pumped out
5026736 but unfortunately it looks as though the underpass will not be open tomorrow morning and we are currently doing contingency planning for that
5026737 we are liaising with the met office in relation to possible heavy rainfall in coming days and we are taking all reasonable precautions to protect continuity of our service
5026738 we were on the ground from about four oclock in one area in lurgan which actually flooded last tuesday
5026739 we couldnt get sandbags we couldnt get anybody from water service rivers agency to take any action

5026741 this was clearly a case of attempted murder we could have been dealing with multiple casualties this morning
5026742 there are a number of families out there who will be counting their blessings that they are not grieving for a loved one
5026743 the disregard that this shows for the lives of the local community and my officers is unbelievable
5026744 those who carried out this deplorable attack have nothing to offer our society they have no support from the community or any political party and will deliver nothing to our community

5026750 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5026751 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5026752 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5026753 on arrival at the scene they found both aircraft had crashed one had gone down in brandon woods
5026754 unfortunately there were four people confirmed dead in the wreckage of that aircraft
5026755 the second aircraft landed in a field near coventry road between brinklow and coventry and sadly one person was confirmed dead at that aircraft crash site
5026756 sadly there was nothing that could be done other than the grim task of confirming the deaths of the five people

5026760 dont expect to get the best interest rate the mortgage lender has to offer
5026761 my goal for the race was to be the first michelin rider home which is what i have achieved but things were too difficult to do better
5026762 i started fully motivated and wanting to give the maximum and exploit fully the material at our disposal but today i cannot be satisfied with the result
5026763 i had difficulty with the front tyre and was forced to change my style of riding which meant not being able to exploit my speed in the corners
5026764 i had to stop hard and fire the bike out of the corners rather than have a smoother style this difficulty penalised us in the race
5026765 we talked about safety because this is the most important thing
5026766 always the bikes get quicker its really difficult to work on safety at the tracks every year we ask for more space run off and when we start to do that the tracks spent more than 80 million euro on safety
5026767 this year we asked jerez for more space and a new surface and jerez did everything and spent 1 7 million but its impossible to do that every year because the tracks do not have enough money to rebuild everything every year
5026768 this is why we have to try and find good solutions not to go slowly but for safety we have some ideas but i cant say now
5026769 carmelo said that the safety has start to be a problem because we work very much on the circuits and they spend a lot of money which is very good but now every year we need to improve the run off area
5026770 so that means even more money for the circuits so some say hey every year it is more money so we need to think of something to go a little bit slower in the corners
5026771 carmelo said this to us on friday in the safety commission to me chris vermeulen loris and marco melandri
5026772 this race is a bit sad for me because we have the potential to do a lot better
5026773 however considering what has happened this weekend and above all the problems with the front tyre i think we have done almost as much as we could
5026774 at the start i didnt want to take too many risks and i could feel that the front tyre was getting worse on each lap but on the other hand the rear tyre was getting better each lap
5026775 i know that we have had had problems this weekend but i know that michelin are working very hard so now we will try to use the test to make some improvements
5026776 today we couldnt have done any better than this but we cant be satisfied to finish tenth
5026777 but overall jorge did a great job and a good race and he was able to find a good rhythm in the middle part of the race continue until to the end and pass many riders plus he was able to score some valuable points

5026804 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5026805 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5026806 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5026807 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5026808 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5026809 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5026810 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5026811 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5026812 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely
5026813 im shocked by the comments because theres lots of sexy cowboys and cowgirls up there
5026814 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking

5026844 we have been working on this for a month and changed so much as you can see from the results of our friendlies we are improving as a team with each game
5026845 we just wanted to play as well as we can we wanted to start all guns blazing
5026846 last year we had a difficult start and the football we played in the first half today was top drawer
5026847 having not won anything last year we go in to this season with a real determination and i think we showed that

5026854 we came here with confidence from the first day and that was clear to see the way we played in the first half
5026855 behind them i see a juventus who are very strong and concrete roma i have always liked while fiorentina has grown dramatically
5026856 ac milan it is true that they do not have the distraction of the champions league but they must beware that the uefa cup is played thursday evenings

5026871 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
5026872 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
5026873 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
5026874 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
5026875 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim

5026878 all eleven of us played pretty well tonight there was still some lapses and room to improve but this was a night to build off
5026879 it was good to be back out there and make a play in the first game i didnt have many tackles so to come out here and actually make a play was a big deal
5026880 i wished i would have gotten there sooner before he got rid of the ball but they didnt convert the third down anyway
5026881 its always a good thing no matter where it is on the field i just wanted to make a play for my teammates and help us get a big stop
5026882 i saw several players make some plays but i know one player that caught my attention on some plays was ray macdonald
5026883 hes working very well on the defense both on the base downs and in the sub package he works closely with justin smith the two of them are working together well as far as pass rush situations whether its on the outside or whether its the inside
5026884 we closed the pocket on him he stepped towards me and i grabbed him took him down and then celebrated with the guys
5026885 it was late in the game and we were just trying to get some rhythm as a defense on the first one i got some good coverage so they gave me some time to get there on the second one i was able to capitalize off the tackle getting the ball out both times
5026886 those guys have been working really hard for the whole off season and the beginning of camp its good to see them have success
5026887 thats the mentality whenever you get a turnover by your offense its our job to get the momentum back and hold them to at the most three points
5026888 all night our guys up front made it easier for us on the back end they were humming up front and getting it done and we know if we give them just an extra few seconds they can get there to the quarterback
5026889 it is about everybody doing what they are supposed to do trusting each other to be exactly where theyre supposed to be especially the wide receivers
5026890 trusting the offensive line to hold up and protect like they did tonight and for us qbs to put the ball exactly where its supposed to be when all those things and the running game are jelling it is going to be really fun to watch this offense
5026891 it was 4th and 1 and the coaches were trusting that we were going to get it in
5026892 i wished i had gotten it on the first three tries so it was time to get it in there the line did their job and i just reached out and got it across
5026893 its a blessing from god the cornerback tried to play me press and i beat him off the line our quarterback made a great throw i just went up to get it
5026894 but the things that stick out in my mind are a couple of missed opportunities the long bomb to josh morgan and the high ball in the back of the end zone to jason hill
5026895 as the fourth quarter came i started getting a rhythm and getting a feel for the game so i was able to make a couple of plays in the fourth quarter
5026896 i feel i improved a little bit but ive got a long way to go
5026897 ive got to tip my hat to the guys that were blocking for me i think i was guilty of trying a little too hard in the beginning the last one i tried to relax he had been giving me some good balls all day i just followed my blocking as best as i could and the rest is history

5026904 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

5026910 i was just out there trying to make all of the plays that i could to help my team win
5026911 but i just tried to take advantage of playing with all of those vets and learning from those guys learning from all of those vets you cant go wrong as long as your are smart and try to soak up what you can learn from them
5026912 it feels really good to have my first td but you dont think about it while you are out there
5026913 you are just having fun catching the ball and trying to make plays for the offense
5026914 it was a great challenge a challenge i didnt expect this early in my nfl career
5026915 they told me id be going against those guys and coming from college youre like huh
5026916 once we ran a couple of pass plays i got a feel for them
5026917 once you get that you just dig in the tool bag and see what you can use on them
5026918 they did a good job on me but i just kept working at it learned from it and kept going
5026919 i think hes going to be a great player in this league hes big strong fast and hes got great hands if he keeps working like he has been hes going to be a dominant player

5026936 the next few weeks should be fairly warm and dry for the bulk of the prairie region which will be good if it comes to pass
5026937 generally speaking the yields are better than they were last year and we have the makings of a good year but we still need to see this harvest weather and what kind of quality we get because that influences the prices the farmers receive
5026938 the quality prospects look fairly good but it is still a little too early to predict the forecast is favourable at the moment
5026939 it all depends on where there have been rain showers
5026940 it will be at least average in terms of yields there is strong demand right now and that is always good news for growers
5026941 all it would take is a few heavy rains or a frost and we would see a dramatic change

5027013 and just in case anyone is wondering about my political affiliation it is simple anti incumbent
5027014 i am almost 40 years old and this is the first time since i was an eligible voter that my presidential ballot will not have the name
5027015 ive had enough of his spilled milk noisy eating and food on the floor
5027016 im voting for senator mccain ill do what i can to help him ill do it as good governor we cut taxes were growing jobs lowest unemployment in 30 years but we have more work
5027017 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5027018 ive had enough of his spilled milk noisy eating and food on the floor
5027019 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live
5027020 the government are pretty incompetent they would never be able to or afford to monitor our whole lives
5027021 the magnets we study are basically the same as a refrigerator magnet only much smaller
5027022 because ferromagnets generate such strong magnetic fields we cant study them with typical mri a related technique ferromagnetic resonance or fmr would work but its not sensitive enough to study individual magnets that are this small
5027023 two factors are critical to keeping our electric rates as low as possible
5027024 i now realize that when you say the united states of america you dont mean the government
5027025 hopefully we can continue the same unity and face anything in the future as one
5027026 im still the same guy im not going to let this bring me down
5027027 i prefer to live in a free dangerous society rather than a secure society without freedoms but we are in a war and i want to use the tools we have to knock down terrorist cells before they act

5027030 profiling may be newest fbi weapon against terrorism race could be used to target u s citizens
5027031 weve got the force necessary to deal with the security situation
5027032 how certain factors traditionally considered risk factors can be reconceptualized as adaptive or protective processes
5027033 institutional racism and societal prejudice place all african american youth including well resourced youth at some degree of risk
5027034 understanding what makes them strong requires acknowledging their experience here in the united states and how discrimination affects their daily lives the study of success is just as important as the study of failure
5027035 this would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts
5027036 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5027037 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5027038 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5027039 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5027040 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time
5027041 i wanted to make sure i took every single moment in
5027042 the things one has to do for ones brother but seriously c kkompany is an important film for tusski normally id do nothing to promote our films but this one is for my kid brother
5027043 when he tusshar asked me to make an appearance in the film i agreed then i made an exception and appeared on the reality show with him
5027044 tusshar has a release my cousin gattu abhishek kapoor has directed
5027045 she said ekta said she will take rakhi gift after the release of the films
5027046 both my brothers will have to gift me something special for raksha bandhan and the quality of the gift would depend on whose film is a bigger hit
5027047 well it feels nice to work in different countries know the culture and musical tastes of the people across borders
5027048 i am really excited for this new hollywood venture the producer and writer of blood money are of indian origin they were looking for an indian voice for their project offer came my way and i accepted
5027049 considering the devastation inherited from war and internal strife the centrally directed system of economic management has attained unquestionable successes especially marked in restoring productive capacity to a level of normalcy and accelerating the pace of economic growth to a respectable per capita magnitude from the ruinously low level of the late 1970s
5027050 made creditable progress in developing social services health care education agriculture and vaccination programs for children and animals
5027051 kicks in if a state is manifestly unable or unwilling to protect its citizens
5027052 coupled together these two words are repeated three times in
5027053 this facility is without a doubt one of the premier swimming and diving facilities in the country we can not express our gratitude to allan and janie enough for making this a reality for our student athletes and generations of ut swimmers and divers to come
5027054 to have one complex that includes one outdoor 50 meter pool an indoor 50 meter pool and the new 50 meter competition pool will in our opinion give tennessee the leading aquatic facility in america
5027055 this in itself is spectacular but the real measure is the amount of support the athletic department and the community are giving to tennessees swimming and diving programs
5027056 creating this scholarship was our familys way of showing our appreciation for dave and the role he has played in our family for the past 15 years this endowment will ensure a scholarship for a tennessee diver for years to come

5027065 painted memories a jewish childhood in poland before the holocaust
5027066 i didnt want to create some nightmarish paintings about their experiences
5027067 other artists have done that and theres a place for art that makes us realize the horror of what happened but what i saw was different
5027068 theres a kind of victory in that and its that feeling that i wanted to capture
5027069 lest future generations know more about how jews died than how they lived
5027070 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her said phelps whose parents separated when he was young
5027071 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time

5027077 they called me mayer july painted memories of a jewish childhood in poland before the holocaust
5027078 my father saw that there was no future for him in poland and he wanted to leave
5027079 he is the custodian of their memory of the town before the holocaust
5027080 cemeteries are evidence of the large jewish population in poland before the holocaust
5027081 being buried in a cemetery means a good death someone buried there lived a life and was buried properly with a marked grave
5027082 my father didnt experience the holocaust firsthand so i didnt include the holocaust paintings
5027083 the goya paintings gave him the confidence to paint his holocaust paintings
5027084 as important as the holocaust is we tend to focus on the end of jewish life in poland
5027085 i wanted to show my students what life was like before the holocaust
5027086 it breaks my heart that youre dying but remember blah blah blah
5027087 i dont think you know how much i appreciate the friendship we had but i probably wouldnt mention it ten years later if you werent dying

5027090 in a sensitive and meaningful way were going to tell the story of how freedom has shaped peoples lives and how people given freedom can contribute to their country
5027091 a tremendous unifying factor for the jewish people in america and really for the jewish people in the world
5027092 who have believed and supported and will continue to support this great institution
5027093 lest future generations know more about how jews died than how they lived
5027094 its an opportunity to spark a community wide conversation about what it means to be jewish
5027095 whether youre more comfortable in a synagogue or a book store youre invited to talk about jewish culture and ideas and what we take from the past and give to the future thats what outwitting history is ultimately about and why we decided to choose it for our program
5027096 i paint not from my imagination but what actually happened
5027097 we had over 200 people and they made a tremendous display the event was well advertised all over the city with posters even the priest mentioned it
5027098 ive had exhibitions elsewhere but here the people the atmosphere was absolutely the best i ever had
5027099 i came to the town and there was not a sign of jewishness
5027100 jadzka the prostitute shows off her wares at the end of market day at harshl kishkes well
5027101 there was a rich cultural life in poland as i knew it at the time thats why i feel im doing something very important by showing what that life was like

5027126 ive had exhibitions elsewhere but here the people the atmosphere was absolutely the best i ever had
5027127 i came to the town and there was not a sign of jewishness
5027128 jadzka the prostitute shows off her wares at the end of market day at harshl kishkes well
5027129 there was a rich cultural life in poland as i knew it at the time thats why i feel im doing something very important by showing what that life was like
5027130 i will be gone but the book will be here
5027131 they consider him really one of the people who holds the memory of the town
5027132 we drove on and as long as we remained in the hills with view succeeding distant view significance was at its everyday level well below transfiguration point
5027133 how do you criticize us were protecting our national interest too

5027136 im already in love with someone but he barely knows i exist
5027137 before you bella my life was like a moonless night very dark but there were stars points of light and reason and then you shot across my sky like a meteor suddenly everything was on fire there was brilliancy there was beauty when you were gone when the meteor had fallen over the horizon everything went black nothing had changed but my eyes were blinded by the light i couldnt see the stars anymore and there was no more reason for anything
5027138 humanitarian corridors between the region of south ossetia and the rest of georgia in such a way that the dead still abandoned may receive worthy burial the wounded may receive adequate care and those who wish to may find their loved ones again

5027140 the ethnic minorities involved in the conflict be guaranteed safety and those fundamental rights that can never be trampled upon
5027141 the current cease fire reached thanks to the contribution of the european union may be reinforced and transformed into stable peace while i invite the international community to continue offering its support for the establishment of a lasting solution through dialogue and common good will
5027142 the word of god thus offers us the opportunity to reflect on the universality of the mission of the church made up of peoples of every race and culture this is the origin of the great responsibility of the ecclesial community which is called to be a house of welcome for all the sign and instrument of communion for the entire human family
5027143 it is important above all in our time that every christian community deepen this awareness more and more in part for the sake of helping civil society to overcome any temptation of racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize itself with decisions respectful of the dignity of every human being one of the great achievements of humanity is in fact precisely the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are worrying new signs of this in various countries often connected to social and economic problems which nonetheless can never justify disrespect and racial discrimination let us pray that respect for every person may increase everywhere together with the responsible awareness that only in the reciprocal welcome of all is it possible to build a world marked by authentic justice and true peace
5027144 grow accustomed to this sad reality human life is too valuable and it is unfit for man to die or be crippled by causes that in most cases could be avoided a greater sense of responsibility is certainly necessary above all on the part of drivers because accidents are often due to excessive speed and imprudent behavior driving a vehicle on the public roads requires a moral sense and a civic sense in promoting the latter of these a constant effort of prevention is indispensable the vigilance and deterrence on the part of the competent authorities as the church in fact we feel ourselves directly involved on the ethical level christians first of all must make a personal examination of conscience of their own conduct as drivers the communities should moreover educate all to consider driving as an area in which to defend life and concretely exercise love of neighbor

5027193 to expect that all the world should and must adopt the pecular political institutions of the united states which often do not work very well even at home is to indulge in the most unrealistic of visions yet just that seems to be the hope and expectation of many neoconservatives such foreign policies are such stuff as dreams are made on yet they lead to the heaps of corpses of men who died in vain

5027226 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5027227 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him

5027237 a possible motive for the killings is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
5027238 the male victim may have been involved in betting scams and the arrangement of fraudulent documentation such as visas and qualifications
5027239 community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people
5027240 we are currently investigating this as a possible motive for the killings

5027249 okay but if anyone misses x amount of rehearsals ill have to ask them to sit this one out
5027250 which the nation has been hearing since many days through the media
5027251 if we would have preemptively worked with russia with georgia making sure that nato had the kind of ability and the presence and the engagement we could have perhaps avoided this
5027252 we need to engage around the world what weve done is focused so much on iraq that a lot of these other issues have slipped theyve not had the priority they deserve theyve not had the kind of attention that an obama administration would provide
5027253 theyve got to withdraw their troops theyve got to show that they can be responsible citizens again
5027254 we need to work with them on climate and on energy so simply to exclude them and completely eliminate them from any real engagement with us is a process that i think we have to be very concerned about
5027255 if it is a stonewall penalty which everybody says it is then i feel really harshly treated

5027287 with these beautiful computers and incredible capabilities hi res music is one of the missing elements but i think thats the future of music
5027288 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5027289 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5027290 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5027291 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5027292 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5027293 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5027294 which the nation has been hearing since many days through the media
5027295 they make food taste better theyre calorie free and most are anti inflammatory
5027296 any chocolate thats below 70 per cent cacao has very little nutritional value
5027297 however we need many nutrients daily to maintain optimal health
5027298 no book was so bad but some good might be got out of it
5027299 babies were not washed as they emerged from the womb but sometimes licked by the mother
5027300 the most convincing clue we have comes from sir charles bell bell wrote that he once visited a spot on the tibet bhutan border where he saw a stupa called bang kar bi tse cho ten that contained the bodies of an eight year old boy and girl who had been slain for the purpose of some religious ritual
5027301 scenting the corpses and blood a demon took possession of the ch ten
5027302 the slavery in the chumbi valley was of a very mild type
5027303 more people were executed in china in the last three months than in the rest of the world for the last three years
5027304 told the government that they were only able to do it because their parents had told them how it was done
5027305 toil and trouble slavery is on the rise in china as number of poor migrants increases beijing appears unwilling and unable to prevent it
5027306 the two races differ strongly in many qualities which have their roots deep down in the characters of the two nations firstly the tibetans are deeply religious the tibetan government is truthful it can be slow obstinate and secretive in dealing with foreigners but it has a strong regard for truth but the chinese authorities from time to time made statements which were deliberately untrue the chinese are far more cruel than the tibetans are when they tried to conquer areas in tibet they used to put to death what prisoners of war they captured although the only offence of these was fighting in defence of their homeland the tibetans when they captured chinese prisoners of war used simply to send them back to china the chinese treat the granting of a favour merely as a step towards asking for another the tibetans do not treat favours in this way they have a national memory of things for which they are grateful many other examples of the differences dividing these two nations could be given for instance the status of women in tibet is higher than china the kinder treatment of animals and the more orderly government
5027307 a mans wealth was first and foremost measured through the number of sons he had
5027308 it was a matter of survival strong hardy sons were needed in every family to work and to fight bandits and settle feuds
5027309 a survey made in 1940 in eastern tibet came to a somewhat different conclusion it found that 38 percent of the households never got any tea but either collected herbs that grew wild or drank white tea boiled water it found that 51 percent could not afford to use butter and that 75 percent of the households were forced at times to resort to eating grass cooked with cow bones and mixed with oat or pea flower
5027310 there is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these tibetans slicing boiling tearing asunder and all to sum up what china is doing here in eastern tibet the main things are collecting taxes robbing oppressing confiscating and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal
5027311 is credited with having introduced into tibet the use of butter tea cheese barley beer medical knowledge and astrology
5027312 all researchers reach a point of diminishing returns where to continue without publishing only postpones the inevitable
5027313 chinese tibetan and nepali sources are not very plentiful on the whole and not readily accessible even if one has the necessary language skills
5027314 who on the face of it had neither the qualification nor any business to write on india
5027315 we in india are accustomed to interested publication patronized patronized is accepted as an elegant synonym for subsidized by the government i hope miss mayo will not take offence if she comes under the shadow of such suspicion

5027319 a decade earlier mutual aid teams were formed then agricultural cooperatives and finally in 1965 66 peoples communes mechanization has begun and experimental agricultural stations have developed more resilient higher yield grains as well as strains of tobacco tea sugar beets and a dozen vegetables which can grow readily in the climate of the roof of the world innovations such as insecticides chemical fertilizers irrigation and veterinary medicine have been introduced into a land that hardly even know of their existence in short the lot of the tibetan people has improved immeasurably
5027320 there were between three to four thousand villages and towns each having between three to four thousand families with four to five thousand people from each town and village about 800 to 1 000 people were imprisoned out of this at least 300 to 400 people of them died in prison
5027321 if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province it would shock the viewers in golok area many people were killed and their dead bodies were rolled down the hill into a big ditch the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should all celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies soon after they were also massacred with machine guns they were all buried there

5027336 wenn jetzt waffen irgendwo auftauchen die vom bund nicht genehmigt worden sind im r stungsexport muss es sich um einen illegalen export handeln
5027337 egal wie diese waffen nach georgien gekommen sind ob sie illegal aus deutschland geliefert worden sind ob ein lizenzbauer gegen die deutschen regeln versto en hat oder ob ein empf nger dieser waffen der sie auf legalem weg aus deutschland bekam weiterexportiert hat auf jeden fall zeigt sich klar dass es ein problem mit der deutschen r stungsexportkontrolle und der kontrolle des endverbleibs solcher waffen gibt

5027348 we have a new character known simply as wyatt cress williams who is the company guy who is trying to track them this year he is the guy with the gun who is hot on our guys trail because when the season begins there is a cover story that our guys are placed into a supermax prison and slowly but surely clues are coming out that they arent in there that theyre up to something else maybe this guys job is to find out what theyre really up to
5027349 another new character is a hacker named roland our team has learned to have some level of trust among each other or at least they know everyone elses agenda but this is a new guy theyre forced to work with and theyre not sure how they feel about him but they need his expertise in the technological stuff that our guys dont necessarily have
5027350 danach w rde ein deal zwischen beiden h usern zwar nicht unm glich aber er w rde deutlich schwerer
5027351 es scheint wieder etwas bewegung in die sache gekommen zu sein
5027352 man h tte danach zwar de facto die gleiche transaktion
5027353 wir sehen keinen anlass f r ver nderungen im conti vorstand

5027355 das land nordrhein westfalen ist bereit seinen anteil an der westlb zu verkaufen der preis muss nat rlich stimmen
5027356 es finden keine kaufverhandlungen zwischen der dekabank und dem land nordrhein westfalen ber die anteile des landes an der westlb statt

5027392 approval of our application will take some unorthodox outside of the box thinking quite literally
5027393 mr yanceys proposal just goes against my principle about encouraging that kind of activity outside the development area
5027394 what that would do is extend the crozet development area south of 250 and that wasnt envisioned by the community during the master planning process and i think its counter to county policy

5027401 i put everything i had on the track i left it out there i have no regrets im not disappointed
5027402 i feel like im very fortunate to be here to be here to make it to the semifinals i couldnt have had a better opportunity because i could have been sitting at home with a knee wrap and brace and surgery
5027403 i was running prs in practice i was really ready to roll come tuesday my knee started going downhill and started falling apart
5027404 i would like to have that opportunity but im not going to be selfish
5027405 if my knee doesnt work im not going to sacrifice my team
5027406 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5027407 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5027408 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5027409 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5027410 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5027411 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5027412 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5027413 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5027414 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5027415 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5027416 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5027417 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5027418 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5027419 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5027420 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5027421 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5027422 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5027423 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5027424 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5027425 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5027426 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5027427 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5027428 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5027429 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5027430 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5027431 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5027432 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5027433 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5027434 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5027435 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5027436 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5027437 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5027438 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5027439 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5027440 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5027441 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5027442 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5027443 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5027444 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5027445 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
5027446 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
5027447 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
5027448 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
5027449 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
5027450 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
5027451 then of course theres just so much to rip on
5027452 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam
5027453 i want to bomb iran using solar powered nuclear weapons
5027454 apple butter will no longer be a second class condiment dinner shouldnt be so spicy sen mccain promises never to negotiate with prussia and yes if elected sen mccain will vote yes on cats being soft
5027455 whenever i get on a plane i know who the air marshal is its always the guy holding the people magazine upside down looking right at me
5027456 looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys
5027457 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
5027458 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
5027459 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
5027460 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
5027461 mccain supports universal health care for all current and former pows
5027462 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact having an affair with his videographer
5027463 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
5027464 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
5027465 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
5027466 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson
5027467 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
5027468 barack obama said today that he is going to fight for votes in all 50 states yeah thats what he said meanwhile john mccain said hes going to fight for votes in all 13 colonies
5027469 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
5027470 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker
5027471 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5027472 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5027473 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5027474 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5027475 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5027476 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
5027477 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5027478 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5027479 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5027480 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5027481 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5027482 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5027483 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5027484 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5027485 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5027486 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5027487 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5027488 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5027489 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5027490 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5027491 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5027492 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5027493 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5027494 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5027495 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5027496 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5027497 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5027498 toll sie haben die anzahl an beschreibungen berschritten die apt handhaben kann
5027499 the worlds youth have a huge personal stake in global warming
5027500 after all it is our future that hangs in the balance the inconvenient youth network will give a voice to the many youth around the world who want to make difference now
5027501 we believe the climate change problem can be solved and youth will make a difference this group of 80 trainees will tap into their local communities and quickly grow to a network of over a thousand youth were already working to schedule sessions at campuses across the nation
5027502 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
5027503 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5027504 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5027505 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5027506 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5027507 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5027508 was it about one more blogger in love with the sound of his own voice and not much in the way of insight to offer
5027509 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5027510 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
5027511 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
5027512 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
5027513 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5027514 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5027515 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
5027516 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
5027517 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
5027518 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
5027519 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5027520 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5027521 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5027522 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5027523 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5027524 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5027525 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5027526 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5027527 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5027528 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5027529 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5027530 o papagaio aprendeu v rias palavras mas n o sabe descascar amendoins
5027531 i usually go about ignoring such things but when someone says as has often been incorrectly alleged id abuse a romantic attachment as a publicity stunt or to promote a new movie of mine thats really just way below the belt
5027532 to love and be loved is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a person and ones own life is much more important than all the glamour and fame in the world
5027533 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again

5027535 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5027536 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5027537 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5027538 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5027539 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5027540 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5027541 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5027542 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5027543 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5027544 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5027545 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5027546 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5027547 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5027548 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5027549 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5027550 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5027551 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5027552 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5027553 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5027554 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5027555 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5027556 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5027557 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5027558 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5027559 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5027560 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5027561 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5027562 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first

5027574 somalian is a very difficult guttural language and i will be damned if i am going to learn how to say
5027575 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5027576 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5027577 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5027578 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
5027579 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
5027580 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
5027581 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
5027582 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
5027583 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
5027584 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
5027585 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
5027586 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
5027587 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
5027588 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
5027589 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
5027590 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
5027591 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
5027592 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
5027593 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
5027594 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5027595 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5027596 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5027597 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5027598 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5027599 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5027600 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5027601 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5027602 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5027603 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5027604 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5027605 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5027606 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5027607 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5027608 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5027609 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
5027610 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

5027612 eend was vroeger een luxe waar je maar kleine porties van kreeg de traditionele peking eend moet moddervet zijn om na een paar happen een vol gevoel te geven
5027613 dit is het lijkt wel echt uit het lichaam van dat beest getrokken en je had beloofd dat we geen enge dingen hoefden te eten
5027614 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making

5027622 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5027623 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5027624 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5027625 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5027626 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5027627 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5027628 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5027629 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5027630 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
5027631 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
5027632 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
5027633 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
5027634 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
5027635 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
5027636 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
5027637 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
5027638 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
5027639 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5027640 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5027641 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5027642 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5027643 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5027644 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5027645 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5027646 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5027647 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5027648 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5027649 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5027650 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5027651 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5027652 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5027653 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5027654 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5027655 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5027656 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5027657 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5027658 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5027659 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5027660 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5027661 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5027662 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5027663 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5027664 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5027665 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5027666 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5027667 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5027668 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5027669 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5027670 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5027671 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5027672 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5027673 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5027674 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5027675 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5027676 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5027677 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5027678 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5027679 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5027680 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5027681 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5027682 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5027683 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5027684 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5027685 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5027686 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5027687 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5027688 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5027689 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5027690 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5027691 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5027692 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5027693 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5027694 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5027695 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5027696 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5027697 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5027698 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5027699 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5027700 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5027701 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5027702 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5027703 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5027704 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5027705 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5027706 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5027707 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5027708 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5027709 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5027714 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5027715 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5027716 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5027717 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5027718 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5027719 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5027720 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5027721 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
5027722 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5027723 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5027724 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5027725 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5027726 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5027727 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5027728 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5027729 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5027730 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5027731 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5027732 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5027733 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5027734 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
5027735 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
5027736 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
5027737 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5027738 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5027739 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5027744 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5027745 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
5027746 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
5027747 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule
5027748 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5027749 yes of course st fama and st french say so

5027761 where do i start how do i put all of this together to actually run a project
5027762 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5027763 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5027764 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5027765 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5027766 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5027767 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5027768 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5027775 dieses wochenende war ein totales desaster das heutige rennen war wahrscheinlich das schlechteste meiner karriere
5027776 ich konnte kein richtiges rennen fahren sondern ich rollte nur herum ich hatte das motorrad nicht unter kontrolle und f hlte mich nicht sicher ich fuhr so langsam dass ich mir schwach und besch mt vorkomme eigentlich wollte ich absteigen aber ich blieb drau en um ein paar punkte zu holen
5027777 ich hatte vorne und hinten null grip von der ersten bis zur letzten runde ich konnte nicht h rter attackieren obwohl ich sehr langsam unterwegs war drei bis vier sekunden langsamer als der f hrende ging einfach nicht mehr zweimal w re ich beinahe abgeflogen also wollte ich nur noch ins ziel kommen ich habe unter schwierigen umst nden mein bestes gegeben
5027778 es ist sehr schwierig f r uns dieses rennen zu kommentieren aber ich bin sehr entt uscht das war ein desaster dani befand sich heute in einer sehr schwierigen situation denn er hatte keinen grip w re er noch schneller gefahren dann w re er vielleicht gest rzt wir wurden eindeutig durch die performance der reifen eingeschr nkt
5027779 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5027780 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5027781 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5027782 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5027783 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5027784 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
5027785 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others

5027799 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant

5027805 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
5027806 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
5027807 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me

5027847 neeraj why dont we move into one of the gated community apartments near our office they have all the facilities it seems you know how much time it takes everyday commuting to the office and back
5027848 yeah i was also thinking about that for some time but what would i tell my father he took a lot of pains to construct this house in the middle of the city and i know what this house means to my father he is emotionally attached to this house i still remember those days when we didnt have so much money how much efforts my father put into buying the plot and constructing the house he sacrificed a lot shruti in fact all of us did to build his dream house he will never leave this house
5027849 all that is fine neeraj but times have changed now and people have their priorities i am not talking about the comforts there neeraj but i am talking about the strain we undergo daily just for commuting
5027850 let all of us move then we will leave this house on rent
5027851 neeraj try to understand its not like we are fighting with them and leaving them for ever we are just looking for a reasonable solution
5027852 in fact i was also thinking about talking about this to you shruti maybe we could come here every weekend and we will not ask for any money from them for purchasing the flat well manage the installments ourselves
5027853 money is not an issue neeraj but i was concerned if they get ill or something who would take care of them
5027854 we are just going to be two hours away shruti and we could also appoint a nurse to take care of them if required i was thinking they may become lonely
5027855 they could always come and stay with us neeraj right now we may not be able to afford a two bedroom apartment but we will in a few years it is only until then talk to your father neeraj
5027856 dad me and shruti have decided to buy one of the apartments coming up near our it park you know how much time we spend every day traveling and of course we wish that you sell this house and come along with us

5027916 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5027917 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5027918 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5027919 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5027920 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5027921 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5027922 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5027923 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5027924 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5027925 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5027926 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5027927 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5027928 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5027929 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5027930 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5027931 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5027932 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5027933 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5027934 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5027935 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5027936 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5027937 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5027938 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5027939 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5027940 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5027941 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5027942 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
5027943 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5027944 se trata de un gesto y un paso para reconstruir la confianza
5027945 se trata de un gesto y de un paso para reconstruir la confianza un intento para fortalecer a los moderados en la ap y el proceso de paz
5027946 cuando israel libera a prisioneros s lo a grupos que emplean la fuerza contra nosotros transmite el mensaje que se rinde ante las presiones y que el uso de la fuerza armada y los secuestros son la nica v a posible para lidiar con nosotros
5027947 bild mit der beziehung alles andere als einverstanden und noch schlimmer sie findet diese schon fast abartig

5027950 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5027951 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5027952 ficou um sabor de derrota vamos acertar alguns detalhes como a falta de aten o em alguns minutos mas a equipe est evoluindo ressaltou o jogador artilheiro do azul o na s rie b ao lado de tuta com cinco gols
5027953 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5027954 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5027955 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5027956 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5027957 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5027958 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5027959 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5027960 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5027961 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5027962 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5027963 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5027964 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5027965 foi um jogo dific limo como a gente j previa eu havia dito que depois da chegada do espinosa a portuguesa cresceu muito de produ o e vem num momento muito bom com jogadores que sabem o que fazem
5027966 l gico que a torcida quer a vit ria que a bola entre mas sab amos que n o adiantava entrar com ansiedade com acertos e erros tivemos a felicidade de vencer o jogo
5027967 na s rie a independentemente de onde se joga dentro ou fora de casa preciso intelig ncia s que a nossa equipe muito jovem vai errar para acertar hoje s bado erramos e foi isso que proporcionou o gol da portuguesa mas o grupo teve equil brio para fazer o resultado
5027968 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5027969 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5027970 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5027971 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5027972 o time da ponte est muito bem montado fechado conseguimos for ar no meio de campo e usamos a velocidade dos atacantes que se revezam na frente
5027973 dif cil vencer a ponte quando ela joga fora de casa

5027975 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5027976 this is a planning took where all things are going
5027977 if you saw your own children in cages what would stop you from freeing them
5027978 blowing stuff up and smashing windows is a great way to bring about animal liberation
5027979 hallelujah to the people who are willing to do it
5027980 we could save a million 2 million 10 million non human lives
5027981 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5027982 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5027983 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5027984 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5027985 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5027986 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5027987 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5027988 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5027989 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5027990 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5027991 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5027992 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5027993 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5027994 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5027995 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5027996 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5027997 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5027998 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5027999 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5028000 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5028001 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5028002 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5028003 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5028004 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5028005 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5028006 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5028007 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5028008 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5028009 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5028010 each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament
5028011 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5028012 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5028013 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5028014 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5028015 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5028016 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5028017 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5028018 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5028019 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5028020 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5028021 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5028022 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5028023 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5028024 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5028025 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5028026 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5028027 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5028028 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5028029 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5028030 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5028031 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5028032 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5028033 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5028034 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5028035 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5028036 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5028037 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5028038 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5028039 i think sen obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
5028040 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
5028041 currently i look like a person with short hair who is too lazy or poor to get it cut
5028042 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5028043 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5028044 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5028045 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5028046 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5028047 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there
5028048 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5028049 and the pilots that are being identified here in ontario are also things that can be used at the national scale
5028050 society has to recognize farmers are willing to do this but we cant do it were not paid to assist
5028051 this is not a widespread please come on down and sign up routine yet this is just trying to find a few producers to make sure all the dang bugs are out of the system before we go full scale
5028052 e t 101 the cosmic instruction manual an emergency remedial edition
5028053 we owe it to the generation who can say thank you
5028054 i think the majority of them are in their 30s and 40s that havent been involved in politics before and obama has lit their fire
5028055 its good for people to know whats going on and be engaged its part of what makes a vibrant community
5028056 people of his age group would complain about what happened between miami and west palm beach it was just sad
5028057 its probably not going to happen like that here but i hate to see it start
5028058 por eso es que ya tenemos una relaci n con la familia de paula
5028059 esta vez le dije a much sima gente que paula iba a ser la primera medalla ol mpica del judo argentino incluso se lo manifest al presidente de la confederaci n argentina de judo obviamente a todos les costaba dar cr dito a eso
5028060 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5028061 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5028062 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5028063 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5028064 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5028065 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
5028066 we are being crucified on why the taser usage and our members actions at the preliminary stages
5028067 just watched the taser video on bbc tv in australia
5028068 and we hope that when more of the facts are made public it will present a clearer picture of truly what happened
5028069 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
5028070 it appears you have been caught in an outright lie
5028071 in the world of communications police have often been criticized for not giving details and or information regarding an incident resulting in allegations that we are hiding something
5028072 as for myself as a spokesperson in the future i will consider saying that we have no comment theres an ongoing investigation and weather the storm of media criticism that we are not forthcoming
5028073 we have to ensure that we have an open relationship with the media because we rely on the media to get the message out to the public
5028074 so how are you going to lie your way out of this one
5028075 when will charges of manslaughter be brought against the officers
5028076 seeing as there will be no proper action taken against the criminals i should hope a similar fate befalls their families
5028077 after the millions of good things that we have done it was very disheartening to see that level of backlash and anger from the public
5028078 i see on the news eight people have died in five years thats about 1 5 a year how many would have died if we didnt have the taser
5028079 of those eight how many had pre existing conditions that likely contributed if not were the cause of death
5028080 stand by for the autopsy results we might be in for a surprise like tasers didnt kill this guy pre existing medical conditions and or drugs in the system wait and see
5028081 in an unprecedented action and in contradiction to his request of the prior week
5028082 this left no legal basis for the videotape to be held
5028083 there are many talented singers who aspire to make a career in singing but cant fulfil their dreams because of various reasons we will be producing albums for those talented singers
5028084 in spite of having enormous talent people opt for other profession to support their family the company will provide a platform to those individuals with talent as the sole criterion
5028085 we plan to give away free cds of the new artistes with every cd of the established singers we will use the popularity of these renowned artistes to promote the album of the new singers
5028086 we are not doing it for any professional gain it is a service to those talented artistes living in india and abroad who could not fulfil their dreams because life did not give them the opportunity
5028087 the things one has to do for ones brother but seriously c kkompany is an important film for tusski normally id do nothing to promote our films but this one is for my kid brother
5028088 when he tusshar asked me to make an appearance in the film i agreed then i made an exception and appeared on the reality show with him
5028089 tusshar has a release my cousin gattu abhishek kapoor has directed rock on that too releases aug 29 as tusshars c kkompany
5028090 both my brothers will have to gift me something special for raksha bandhan and the quality of the gift would depend on whose film is a bigger hit
5028091 until we screened in palestine it didnt feel like we were finished yet
5028092 over 4000 people came out to nablus to see the show i couldnt get the gaza rappers out for the screening and i couldnt get into gaza myself the shows in ramallah and jenin were awesome
5028093 i was in gaza in 2003 for the first hip hop show there ever we just decided to make a movie
5028094 i didnt know anything about filmmaking and there were lots of production problems i didnt even bother reading the manual before i picked up the camera we were working on graphics and the sound right up to sundance
5028095 but basically i paid for the film on my credit cards
5028096 even in the production i left cameras with dam and abeer and pr i wanted the film to speak with their voices as much as possible
5028097 they did start getting impatient after a couple of years it was hard to convince them that taking a bit of extra time would make it that much better
5028098 but they were very loyal to me plenty of other filmmakers approached them in those years but they told them no jackie will make the first movie they even turned down al jazeera thats a big sacrifice
5028099 what really changed dams music was the second intifada thats when they released meen irhabi the intifada made the zionist rapper worse he sings death to arabs you never hear palestinian rappers singing death to jews
5028100 i have so much respect for their integrity coca cola is a big player in israel and they approached dam about doing an ad for them they offered them a lot of money but the guys told them no you hear about that and you realize these guys really have principals even though theyre broke
5028101 the hip hop is different in different parts of palestine in gaza its harder to have shows because its more religious even though all the rappers believe in god yet it took off there more than anywhere else
5028102 taking images and placing them next to each other and setting them to music that all comes pretty naturally to me when i heard sundance wanted to screen it and i had no idea what it meant
5028103 people have told me that slingshot is the first palestine film theyve seen that doesnt make them depressed
5028104 when i first started i didnt want to start with the middle east because it was too close to me
5028105 were all on the left here so youre just preaching to the choir
5028106 each comes with a magnet sticker or ring of your favorite revolutionary
5028107 each capsule comes with a palestinian refugee collect all 5 million
5028108 a woman walked into an exhibition that had one of my gumball machines
5028109 she put in a quarter and one of my rings dropped out she came back with a roll of quarters and kept feeding them in one after the other
5028110 i asked her what are you doing i was a little irritated i guess because a lot of time and energy goes into each one of those items she told me i just liked to collect rings
5028111 i dont think my work is going to change the world that people will want to overthrow israel after seeing my film but if im going to work it has to be meaningful with slingshot i also want to help the artists
5028112 one of the problems palestinians face is how theyre represented in the media that means we have to make different media media is our strongest weapon i think
5028113 i dont want to make anything longer than three minutes
5028114 in islam anyone is free to declare that he or she is telling the truth in a matter but not by holding the quran as it is copying the practice of christians
5028115 sumpah laknat swearing in the face of divine retribution that was done by saiful when he swore on the quran was permitted by islam and now it depended on the sincerity of his oath that he had been sodomised by anwar

5028119 ese es mi hijo el que un d a estaba en mi vientre siendo una peque a semillita y que por obra de dios y siendo la naturaleza de la vida fuiste creciendo mes a mes en mi vientre hasta completar tus nueve meses y despu s de pasar por momentos dif ciles para que pudieras llegar al mundo yo te acun entre mis brazos como no queriendo que nada te lastimara que nada te mortificara pues ese llanto que escuch al tiempo que naciste derram l grimas de gratitud y de felicidad
5028120 you are agreeing to a contract we love to combine shipping so please see our other wonderful items and know that we will reduce the shipping fees for you
5028121 the way i come into a target is i start above the target and come down from 12 oclock and get into the bullseye
5028122 and as i get down into the bullseye is when i start to get on the trigger with my finger and as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
5028123 i guess i just set it off i got on the trigger a little too hard i didnt feel my trigger shaking but i guess it was it just hit the trigger the gun went off and i was like uh thats not going to be good i hope it hit the black

5028127 how certain factors traditionally considered risk factors can be reconceptualized as adaptive or protective processes
5028128 institutional racism and societal prejudice place all african american youth including well resourced youth at some degree of risk
5028129 understanding what makes them strong requires acknowledging their experience here in the united states and how discrimination affects their daily lives the study of success is just as important as the study of failure
5028130 this would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts
5028131 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5028132 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5028133 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5028134 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5028135 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time
5028136 open your fucking minds be accepting of different people and let people be who they are or because i said hey dude how you gonna say fag right in front of a gay dudes face and act like thats ok
5028137 its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
5028138 theyve known each other for a while and now theyre hooking up
5028139 shes been bragging to her friends about how cute he is and even brought him to pop burger after the show on july 17
5028140 as it stands now john will be on the red carpet with her and dont be at all surprised to see jennifer sporting an engagement ring by then these two are serious jennifer continues to be more public in her relationship with john than she has with anybody ever
5028141 nobody will be surprised to see jennifer there for the last stop it will be a big night for him and jennifer loves south florida

5028143 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

5028209 these details are included in a seven page policy statement the campaign is expected to formally release today john mccain has previously said he supports the moon and mars exploration strategy and that he too will work to minimize the number of years in which nasa has no way to send astronauts into space
5028210 the policy puts new pressure on mccain ahead of his private meeting with space industry leaders mccains low key visit to the space coast comes more than two weeks after obama held a town hall meeting in titusville where he pledged his support to a robust space policy and said he would no longer seek to raid nasas budget to support his education reform plans mccain on the other hand has been quiet about his space policy beyond endorsing sending americans to the moon he recently released his own enhanced position on the issue on his web site without any fanfare

5028218 except for two passes where he floated the ball he played exceptional

5028231 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system

5028240 approximately 40 percent of all traffic deaths in alabama involve alcohol the danger drunk drivers pose to every man woman and child who travel on our roads cannot be taken lightly and in alabama we dont take this threat lightly
5028241 this is another tool that will be available for law enforcement as we try to stop drunk driving
5028242 impaired driving is not an accident its a crime one that were not going to tolerate
5028243 dui is something that every law enforcement agency takes very seriously and works hard at tying to stop
5028244 we want to keep those fatalities declining and this campaign is a part of that overall program

5028268 aber es spricht einiges dagegen dass es teil des innenministeriums ist diese blaue manie der schwarzen alle immigrations und fremdenrechtsfragen immer unter dem latenten kriminalit tsverdacht zu sehen und ausl nder immer im zusammenhang mit sicherheit das halten wir f r falsch das staatssekretariat m sste also im justiz oder sozialministerium oder im bundeskanzleramt angesiedelt sein
5028269 die vp handelt einwanderer latent unter kriminalit tsverdacht ab klar braucht es festgelegte regeln sterreich braucht zum beispiel ein rechtsstaatliches verfahren zum bleiberecht da lade ich molterer ein ber diese regeln zu diskutieren
5028270 madeleine petrovic und ich waren pers nlich immer f r die absetzbarkeit die mehrheit der gr nen war aber dagegen denn gleichzeitig muss es den gratiskindergarten geben da geht die vp mit nur einem jahr aber noch nicht weit genug
5028271 vizekanzler zu werden ist sicher nicht mein lebensziel das h tte ich 2003 auch haben k nnen aber wir sind vom verhandlungstisch aufgestanden wir werden das definitiv im oktober wissen aber ich rei mich nicht um dieses amt weil ich viel zu viel respekt davor habe so ein amt oder auch ein ministeramt innezuhaben ist schon eine herausforderung ersten ranges
5028272 ive sat by in silence for a long time now about the way womens bodies are constantly scrutinized to set the record straight im not upset for me but for all of the girls out there that are struggling with their body image
5028273 a size 2 is not fat nor will it ever be and being a size 0 doesnt make you beautiful
5028274 what i should be doing is celebrating some of the best days of my life and my engagement to the man of my dreams instead of having to deal with photographers taking invasive pictures from bad angles i know what i look like and so do my friends and family and like all women out there should i love my body
5028275 to all girls with butts boobs hips and a waist put on a bikini put it on and stay strong
5028276 to have to defend your weight or explain it i dont understand when that happened
5028277 of course it bothers you a few months ago people thought i was pregnant maybe i was bloated that day its one of those things youve got to laugh at
5028278 shes not being lit in a studio and made up or airbrushed or wardrobed its not a fat thing
5028279 theres a distorted view of what a hollywood starlet should be shes in the normal range
5028280 kudos to jennifer love hewitt its painful to see the constant pressure on girls to be a certain size i wish that we could get everybody to take a stand like her its so demeaning to people to keep apologizing for having a healthy size
5028281 good for her for saying this is who i am im happy with my size
5028282 it was an unflattering picture of her shes a beautiful girl and she looks absolutely perfect
5028283 theyre just jiggly and no matter how much i work out they just dont look like gisele b ndchens
5028284 i have a lovely thing called cellulite on my butt
5028285 her teenage metabolism is going away now that shes all grown up
5028286 i eat something now and i see it on my leg or i feel a difference body wise
5028287 i do still eat pretty much what i want i still like my in n out burger i just eat small portions
5028288 i literally have half an hour to myself before i go to work and maybe a couple of hours when i get home
5028289 never did it cross my mind that i wanted to spend that time working out
5028290 i try to never go out of the house looking horrid

5028303 love your peppermint foot lotion it keeps my feet so soft
5028304 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
5028305 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
5028306 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
5028307 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
5028308 the world is watching and they are waiting for us and they are waiting to see what were made of
5028309 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
5028310 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
5028311 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
5028312 there were a lot of things going through my mind
5028313 first and foremost it was just good to get back with my fellow offensive linemen the kind of fun we have i really missed it
5028314 and just being in the huddle with quarterback donovan mcnabb he is a very charismatic guy and it kind of helps for that moment to take away the issues in your mind it was refreshing a beautiful day
5028315 there were a lot of rumors floating around and i created a lot of them out of a lot of frustration
5028316 i guess i had gotten to the point where i didnt care what people thought about me that wasnt the real me
5028317 the eagles organization has always done a great job of getting character guys here and it showed they made me feel very comfortable if any of them doubted me they didnt show it
5028318 speaking to the team was something i needed and had to do because of the way i just disappeared i just wanted to let them know that i wasnt trying to get out of work im no stranger to hard work i hope they respect me and if they dont ill do everything possible to gain their respect back
5028319 we talked about making sure shawn was ok and that he got help he needed when we felt that he was in a good place mentally and emotionally we talked about the football part of it
5028320 thats kind of whats taken some time you get into these things the football part is secondary to the person and we want to make sure the persons alright
5028321 i was just sitting in my room thinking about things all day and people were very concerned about me
5028322 i was on the edge and things werent going well i wouldnt say i was contemplating suicide but i had some very unrealistic thoughts i was really lost i felt like there was no outlet i had to open up before it was too late
5028323 it feels good just to be back and around my teammates you dont get that comradery in too many other places
5028324 the last week has been pretty tough i was kind of pessimistic as to how my teammates would receive me back im still going through a lot but being back with the team has been a big step for me
5028325 a aus ncia dela stella acabou com ele ele entrou numa melancolia desistiu de comer desistiu de tudo
5028326 esses dias todos ficamos tentando que ele levantasse ele completou os 94 anos sem ela foi horr vel
5028327 ele n o soube do coma mas desconfiou porque ela n o ligou mais para ele
5028328 mas aconteceu de uma forma que a fam lia toda desejava ou seja ele morreu em casa como ele mesmo queria com serenidade
5028329 infelizmente perdemos um grande cantor e compositor mas a obra fica

5028331 but from age three we knew something was wrong she was very introverted isolated when she started school at four she came home and said she was a freak it seemed a strange word for a four year old to use she was always quite a sad little person
5028332 looking back we could never find any tape in the house it was because she was taping her genitals up every day she said to us later that she thought it would all go right for her at puberty that her willy would drop off and she would grow breasts she said she was going completely crazy because she knew in her head that she was a girl
5028333 she was there in front of the mirror with her genitals tucked away
5028334 i had watched programs on transgender im very interested in people its part of who i am to find out about these things but you never imagine its going to happen to you
5028335 it was apparent he was unhappy and said he wanted to be a girl
5028336 thousands of families face raising children who step outside the pink or blue box
5028337 well say things like youre special god made you special because there arent very many little girls out there that have a penis
5028338 it usually becomes more evident when they go to school
5028339 there have been reported cases of kids who wont drink for the duration of the school day so that they dont have to go to the toilet and who dont want to sleep in a bedroom with their peers
5028340 we get 60 to 80 referrals a year and our referrals are going up we see children from as young as six up to aged 18
5028341 we get a lot of calls from parents who have five to nine year olds there seem to be more boys than girls affected at that age
5028342 which is probably because its more acceptable for girls to be tomboys if you have a little girl who wants to cut her hair short or play football that is seen as normal but if you have a boy who wants to draw mermaids or dress up as a princess they get made fun of
5028343 for others it is likely to go on for some years and will cause a lot of problems
5028344 as far as theyre concerned a trans outcome is bad they are hoping that during puberty the natural hormones themselves will act on the brain to cure these trans teenagers what we do know is what happens if you dont offer hormone blockers you are stuck with unwanted secondary sex characteristics in the long term and in the short term these teenagers end up suicidal
5028345 the only indication i did have when she was a child was that she showed an interest in female clothing not wearing it but just having some in her room
5028346 i said you mustnt take your sisters clothes and then forgot about it i was completely amazed shocked and frightened when i did find out some years later what was happening but i have always felt that people have a right to be who they are i felt that whoever this person was i was her parent and i wanted to support her
5028347 we have run 11 family workshops and seen over 200 individuals in family situations i like to think that we have helped an enormous number of people to get over that first shock of rejection and sadly sometimes revulsion
5028348 when you live with it it is so obvious and so extreme
5028349 some of these children are saying from a very early age this is what i am why doesnt anyone understand that my name is bob and i am not a girl sometimes its as soon as they can talk at age two or three
5028350 the uk stance on puberty suppressing drugs is completely unreasonable in other countries they are provided as soon as puberty has commenced but obtaining this treatment which suppresses estrogen in girls and testosterone in boys is very difficult in this country
5028351 it is a temporary reversible intervention if the child changes their mind they can be interrupted they are entirely benign with no known side effects
5028352 but there are cases that are very clear where the disorder is strong and persistent
5028353 the dutch data looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up the data is not over a long enough period of time and that concerns endocrinologists
5028354 the question is if you halt your own sex hormones so that your brain is not experiencing puberty are you in some way altering the course of nature
5028355 there is a small amount of evidence for differences in the brain
5028356 that is a very interesting finding but it is not robust enough to say that it is definitely the only reason and that it is an innate condition it is most likely multifactorial
5028357 feelings are very intense and it is very difficult for families and young people to cope with the uncertainty they are very strong in their conviction that they are in the wrong body
5028358 at her school they were shocked but they were wonderful
5028359 it was explained to all the year groups that it was a condition and not a choice they explained the effect it had on her and that bullying would not be tolerated the kids were great it was the parents saying they didnt want a freak in school with their child
5028360 it took us about two years to stop crying for our loss and also for the pain that we knew our child was going to have to go through no one would choose this its too hard ive asked my daughter if this condition was known about in 1989 when i was pregnant and there was an option to have a termination would you have wanted me to she said yes and i agree if i had known what it would be like for her i would have done it thats how bad it is
5028361 she is still young and everything is raw for her she hates the label transsexual she is just a girl who happened to need the surgery to make her genitals right
5028362 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5028363 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy

5028394 o que eu quero enfatizar como as pessoas est o gastando o seu dinheiro acredito que a felicidade um investimento e proponho que as pessoas pensem duas vezes antes de consumir
5028395 esses instintos s o reflexo de uma necessidade muito primitiva do ser humano de ter mais de ser melhor muitos economistas dizem que isso pr hist rico e tamb m dif cil de ignorar ainda mais com todos os est mulos que existem hoje pode at ajudar dizer para algu m n o comprar mais nada mas isso imperativo demais e tamb m n o divertido e nem significa nada

5028407 that we are having a major speculative splurge as this is written is obvious to anyone not captured by vacuous optimism there is now far more money flowing into the stock markets than there is intelligence to guide it there are many more mutual funds than there are financially acute historically aware men and women to manage them i am not given to prediction ones foresight is forgotten only ones errors are well remembered but there is here a basic recurrent process it comes with rising prices whether of stocks real estate works of art or anything else this increase attracts attention and buyers which produces the further effect of even higher prices expectations are thus justified by the very action that sends prices up the process continues optimism with its market effect is the order of the day prices go up even more then for reasons that will endlessly be debated come the end the descent is always more sudden than the increase a balloon that has been punctured does not deflate in an orderly way to repeat i make no prediction i only observe that this phenomenon has manifested itself many times since 1637 when dutch speculators saw tulip bulbs as their magic road to wealth and 1720 when john law brought presumptive wealth and then sudden poverty to paris through the pursuit of gold to this day undiscovered in louisiana in these years aslso the great south sea bubble spread financial devastation in britain

5028410 this reluctance to concede that the end has come is also in accordance with the classic pattern the end had come in florida in 1925 bank clearings in miami were 1 066 528 000 by 1928 they were down to 143 364 000 farmers who had sold their land at a handsome price and had condemned themselves as it later sold for double treble quadruple the original price now on occasion got it back through a whole chain of subsequent defaults sometimes it was equipped with eloquently named streets and with sidewalks street lamps and taxes and assessments amounting to several times its current value
5028411 he was a director to general motors an ally of the du ponts and soon to be chairman of the democratic national committee by choice of al smith
5028412 the shrewd worldly wise candidate of one of the great political parties chooses one of the outstanding operators in the stock market as a goodwill creator and popular vote getter
5028413 if smith should be elected with a democratic congress we are almost certain to have a resulting business depression in 1929
5028414 the election of hoover and a republican congress should result in continued prosperity for 1929
5028415 there is no cause for worry the high tide of prosperity will continue
5028416 some of those in positions of authority wanted the boom to continue they were making money out of it and they had an intimation of the personal disaster which awaited them when the boom came to an end but there were also some who saw however dimly that a wild speculation was in progress and that something should be done for these people however every proposal to act raised the same intractable problem the consequences of successful action seemed almost as terrible as the consequences of inaction and they could be more horrible for those who took action a bubble can easily be punctured but to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy among those who sensed what was happening in 1929 there was some hope but no confidence that the boom could be made to subside

5028439 none of us want a special session right now on property taxes
5028440 you couldnt get a special session in the florida legislature right now if you paid every one of them 1 000
5028441 the proposed amendment cloaked substantial facts in order to aim for an emotional response from purposefully misinformed voters anticipating lower taxes and no harm done give those voters a clearer picture theyre likely to react less emotionally and more rationally once they discover that overall taxes wont necessarily be lower considering the shift to the sales tax while overall services in the state will almost certainly be poorer beginning with the already begging education system

5028526 ze ontmoette lindsay in de zomer van 2006 op een feestje in malibu lindsay was zeer verward door haar gevoelens voor courtenay dus begon ze steeds meer drugs te nemen om de seksuele aantrekking die ze ervaarde te smoren uiteindelijk ging ze voor de bijl en op elk feestje kusten en betastten ze elkaar in een hoekje het is een wonder dat het niet eerder is uitgekomen ze snoven coke op het toilet en gingen naar huis waar ze samen in bed belandden

5028556 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5028557 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5028558 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5028559 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5028560 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5028561 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5028562 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5028563 we werent very good at all on a night where they didnt get many chances we fall asleep on a set play and thats the way the games decided
5028564 it was frustrating in a way in that you always want to get goals and win games i am here to be a part of the team and help out any way i can
5028565 i got in at 5 pm on thursday and you have a little time change issues but after travelling so long you understand what your body needs and i continue to take care of that
5028566 the second half we made a great push we were a little impatient in the decision making in the final third which is something that has been going on all season but i thought the effort was there in the second half
5028567 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
5028568 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
5028569 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
5028570 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard
5028571 probably people have overreacted its nationalism going a bit awry
5028572 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
5028573 we tried to move the ball laterally and we did not want to keep the ball in the center of the field so much
5028574 we wanted to move it out wide we were finding a lot of success that way
5028575 i dont think he has ever scored here which is kind of ironic because he has scored so many goals for us
5028576 youve got to figure out how to win you have to figure out how to win when youre not playing well you have to figure out when youre playing well you have to figure out how to win when youre dominating games
5028577 in houston two weeks ago i thought we were the better team and we got nothing in colorado we probably got out played a bit and we got something in every game scenario you want to figure out how to win
5028578 the result of more than two decades of negotiations the declaration provides a momentous opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to strengthen their relationships promote reconciliation and ensure that the past is not repeated
5028579 the declaration is a manifestation of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states and a mechanism for carrying that reconciliation forward indeed 2008 has already witnessed concrete measures towards reconciliation in several countries
5028580 were not going to bring it up to ted hell shoot us up the butt with a bow and arrow
5028581 just the idea of knowing that you have a disease thats incurable and that awful sentence of having cancer is just a lot to take in emotionally
5028582 now i feel like im helping the chemo out basically
5028583 theres not a cure through traditional western medicine whereas this could potentially go throughout my entire body and destroy every single cell of cancer
5028584 thats what this is all about is giving back and serving people and helping people heal
5028585 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5028586 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5028587 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5028588 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5028589 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5028590 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5028591 all he talked about was his family and this city
5028592 i was taking classes and working out with the team but i knew right away i just had this feeling that n c state was not where im supposed to be
5028593 i feel like i fit right in here and that this is where im supposed to be
5028594 were happy to have her and i think shes going to be a great player for us
5028595 ive seen her play a lot over the last couple of years and the thing you cant help but notice is how hard she plays
5028596 its like starting all over again i had some feelings i havent felt in 17 years i had a lot of fun
5028597 no one asks me who laszlo and vilmos are when they see the title
5028598 laszlo kovacs asc and vilmos zsigmond asc truly became legends in their own time leonard maltin described them as the cutting edge of the american new wave
5028599 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs they were hugging and kissing and looked ecstatic ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu

5028603 von den bildern her sieht die strecke toll aus ich liebe stra enkurse aber diese piste sieht extrem schnell aus und scheint an einigen stellen wenig fehler zu verzeihen als fahrer macht es immer spa an eine neue strecke zu kommen
5028604 das deb trennen in valencia ist ein komplett neues spielfeld f r alle beteiligten dort kommen 310 rennkilometer auf uns zu sowie eine strecke auf der die wagen f nfmal in einem umlauf auf ber 300 stundenkilometer beschleunigen wir rechnen mit einer durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit von 225 km h f r ein stra enrennen ist das eher untypisch das klingt vielmehr nach silverstone oder monza innerhalb einer stadt
5028605 wenn man valencia mit monaco vergleicht hat man es zwar mit zwei stadtkursen zu tun die allerdings deutlich unterschiedliche charaktere haben und andere anforderungen an das fahrzeug stellen mit hilfe unserer simulationsprogramme sind wir in der lage das abtriebslevel also die aero konfiguration sowie die belastung f r die bremsen und die gang bersetzungen zuverl ssig vorauszuberechnen damit wir mit einer guten basisabstimmung beginnen k nnen in valencia werden wir mit hohem abtrieb antreten aber nicht mit maximalem downforce wie in monaco
5028606 wir bekommen im vorfeld nur eine begrenzte datenmenge wie beispielsweise ein karte des streckenverlaufs die fahrer arbeiten mit ihren ingenieuren zusammen um zu verstehen was auf diesem kurs verlangt wird dann k nnen sie den simulator benutzen und die strecke abfahren wenn vor dem event eine streckenkarte verf gbar ist
5028607 ich habe keinen simulator ich habe ein paar videos des formel 3 rennens gesehen und alles scheint ger stet zu sein der kurs sieht nicht wie ein klassischer stadtkurs aus er ist breit er sieht wie ein amerikanischer kurs aus er hat einen guten asphalt die mauern sind entfernt worden es ist nicht monaco es ist eine mischung aus einer permanenten strecke und einem stadtkurs es wird ein gro artiger und interessanter gro er preis werden

5028609 i havent thought of retirement yet because i love diving if possible i will continue
5028610 i like the feeling when i stand on the springboard i just cant give it up
5028611 she really dictated her own path in diving shes the most powerful female diver in the world
5028612 she just dominated when it counts and shes been doing that for a long time
5028613 guo has won eight golds at the world championships an event she hasnt lost at in a decade
5028614 not very much ive done everything ive wanted to in my career
5028615 just to be able to get the top seed and not have to face the americans till the gold medal game is huge
5028616 we just knew we had to buckle down on defense and get stops to fuel our offense
5028617 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures
5028618 i said damn they might pull a jones on me
5028619 it was no disrespect to the fighter but there was no point for me to be in there
5028620 i had some pressure because it was going to be the first medal for cuba here but the team prepares me very well
5028621 im prepared to beat the olympic champion or the world champion
5028622 i thought they were going to give it to him
5028623 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
5028624 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5028625 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
5028626 we all have our good days amp our bad days we just have to know how to handle them

5028661 apa yang berlaku dalam konteks saiful bukhari bersumpah memperlihatkan keganjilan bilamana sepatutnya yang bersumpah adalah pihak yang kena tuduh tetapi apa yang berlaku adalah pihak yang menuduh
5028662 mendengar saiful melibatkan memohon kepada allah melaknatinya beserta keluarga dan keturunannya tanpa menyebutkan berapa lama seolah olah sampai ke hari kiamat mana ada sumpah yang meminta allah melaknati keturunan
5028663 tidak sepatutnya keturunan yang akan mewarisi kita dilaknati allah bersama atas permintaan kita sedangkan mereka keluarga tidak melakukan kesalahan

5028683 the catholic church has changed and i dont recognize or believe in it anymore
5028684 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5028685 the government must take immediate steps to develop bi lateral co operation agreements and joint investigations with other countries to return sex offenders to the uk and give clear guidance on when travel bans should be used to protect the worlds most vulnerable children
5028686 reverse the ideology that if abuse happens overseas then we should simply let the governments over there deal with it
5028687 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5028688 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
5028689 presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more
5028690 we also recently signed the council of europes convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children and adopt similar standards of investigation
5028691 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
5028692 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
5028693 russia wants international recognition and respect we must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt
5028694 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
5028695 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
5028696 when david cameron matches his tough talk on expanding nato more quickly with a pledge to double defence spending or introduce military conscription perhaps then we could take him seriously

5028721 i want you to come to know of the concern and dedication that this woman had for islam as described by those who knew her a dedication that was manifested by way of actions that were very simple and easy yet seldom carried out by those who are able
5028722 this distinction was simply of one group deciding to take upon its shoulders certain responsibilities in contrast to the other whose inactivity limited them to a very individualistic localized benign practice of islam
5028723 where are the men why do i have to be the one standing up here and doing this work
5028724 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam
5028725 imagine our humble but sincere dawah effort turning into a major dawah movement in this country just imagine it and us reaping the reward of everyone who accepts islam through this movement through years to come think and plan big may allah give this strength and sincerity to us so that our humble effort continue and expands until america becomes a muslim land
5028726 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language

5028732 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

5028750 sa de mental est ligada ao meio ambiente de trabalho
5028751 a sa de mental pode ser pensada com um estado de bem estar social
5028752 nesse contexto as doen as psicol gicas constituem altera es do funcionamento da mente interferindo na capacidade cognitiva e afetiva do trabalhador
5028753 n o existe um tipo de fun o em que esses tr s aspectos n o estejam relacionados
5028754 a temos a intensifica o da autocr tica a diminui o do prazer de viver ao lado dos outros causando o chamado transtorno mental que est relacionado a fatores end genos mas tamb m externos
5028755 estamos diante de uma situa o preocupante pois a cada ano acontecem milh es de suic dios em nosso planeta
5028756 est aqu m daquilo que vem de fato ocorrendo em nosso pa s
5028757 o cen rio n o apenas produzido mas induzido pelo mercado globalizado que exige solu es r pidas e eficazes dos trabalhadores
5028758 a empresa procura agora um novo tipo de trabalhador n o s com conhecimento habilidade mas sa de perfeita excel ncia compet ncia e conhecimentos tecnol gicos apurados o saber fazer transformou se em pr requisito um saber fazer formatado que n o d espa o para a criatividade
5028759 os meios para se conseguir isso se tornam menos importantes a embalagem passa a ser quase t o ou at mais que o pr prio produto o superficial pode adquirir o seu fator social dependendo do poder de sedu o que se mostre capaz de exercer
5028760 estamos diante de uma guerra invis vel em nosso ambiente de trabalho onde o homic dio j se converteu na principal causa de morte
5028761 temos as vari veis da competi o da hierarquia supervalorizada dos est gios mal definidos e ao lado disso os atos discriminat rios tamb m relacionados ao estado de sa de mental do trabalhador
5028762 nosso desejo como m dica e que escuta todos os dias a hist ria de descaso contra a vida que todos vivam bem vivam bem n o s custas de subnotifica es e demiss es por adoecimento ser mais digno ag entar as desgra as da vida ou guerrear contra os problemas no ambiente de trabalho
5028763 a sa de mental depende certa medida da justi a social e o trabalho preventivo deve ser feito antes da fase de conflito
5028764 exatamente isso que resume a trajet ria da responsabilidade civil
5028765 o modelo cl ssico da responsabilidade civil previsto no c digo civil de 1996 era eminentemente individualista era uma responsabilidade cujo t tulo de imputa o era a culpa e a obriga o indenizat ria era de cunho econ mico patrimonial
5028766 a transi o da culpa ao risco passando a uma responsabilidade civil que passa a se ocupar da dignidade da pessoa humana em todos os seus aspectos
5028767 imposs vel um modelo de responsabilidade civil que abandone o sentido de culpa
5028768 a recompreens o da responsabilidade civil abre um espectro grande de pesquisa sobre a expans o da efic cia de novos t tulos de responsabiliza o de algu m a id ia n o mais procurar um culpado mas sim um respons vel
5028769 tamb m n o podemos partir do pressuposto de que a responsabilidade civil meramente subjetiva
5028770 os operadores do direito est o aplicando a teoria do ato il cito e de fundamenta o na culpa quando na verdade est ocorrendo uma mudan a que deve produzir efeitos imediatos para o direito do trabalho
5028771 n o podemos simplesmente ler a constitui o sem pensarmos no reflexo que essa mudan a tem em nossa vida e no direito do trabalho
5028772 os n meros mostram como os ndices de acidentes se multiplicaram era uma realidade que antes da justi a do trabalho n o estava acostumada a lidar
5028773 importante que tenhamos em mente que a dignidade da pessoa humana deve ser vista como o centro de todo sistema jur dico brasileiro
5028774 precisamos de plasticidade para nos adaptar evolu o do modo social de conceber e experimentar a vida
5028775 a justi a do trabalho ainda n o tem atentado para essa mudan a estrutural de compreens o do tema acident rio
5028776 n o podemos cometer o estelionato constitucional n o precisamos fazer nada basta que leiamos com aten o o que diz o artigo 1 de nossa constitui o

5028783 alla base del delirante articolo dellindependent e di altri uscite diffamatorie della stampa internazionale contro le nostre citt c anche la propaganda strumentale fatta in particolare da una certa sinistra contro quei comuni amministrati dal centrodestra che hanno adottato rigide ordinanze antidegrado
5028784 io considero lui e il suo lavoro che raccoglie quello svolto da valentino castellani parte costitutiva di una moderna idea dellazione riformista
5028785 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5028786 and if anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
5028787 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5028788 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5028789 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5028790 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5028791 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5028792 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5028793 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5028794 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5028795 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5028796 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5028797 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5028798 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5028799 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5028800 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5028801 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5028802 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5028803 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5028804 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5028805 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5028806 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5028807 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5028808 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5028809 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5028810 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5028811 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5028812 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5028813 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5028814 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5028815 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5028816 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5028817 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5028818 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5028819 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5028820 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5028821 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5028822 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5028823 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5028824 who are open to doing something on the production side
5028825 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5028826 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5028827 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5028828 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5028829 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5028830 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5028831 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5028832 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5028833 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5028834 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5028835 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5028836 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5028837 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5028838 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5028839 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5028840 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5028841 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5028842 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5028843 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5028844 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5028845 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5028846 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5028847 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5028848 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5028849 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5028850 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5028851 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5028852 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5028853 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5028854 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5028855 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5028856 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5028857 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5028858 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5028859 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5028860 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5028861 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5028862 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5028863 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5028864 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5028865 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5028866 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5028867 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5028868 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5028869 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5028870 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5028871 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5028872 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5028873 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5028874 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5028875 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5028876 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5028877 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5028878 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5028879 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5028880 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5028881 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5028882 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5028883 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5028884 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5028885 fuck em all were in charge of the world damn it
5028886 the only threats to us in the alpha quadrant now are the federation and the klingons and neither are going to be a problem for much longer
5028887 i thought we played well weve had a lot of one on one chances with the goalie there were probably two great chances tonight one with sainey nyassi chance against joe cannon and a free kick in the middle of the box those were two key parts of the game
5028888 were not tired we just didnt take our chances in the game we started off poorly and it was hard to pick up we didnt have the ability and strength on the field to do a better job in the end
5028889 its tough playing as many games as we have we have been playing mid week a lot with a lot of traveling we have injuries people on the olympic team and red cards were fielding the best teams we can we were not our best tonight
5028890 weve had a lot of games in a short amount of time the job is tough but we are not making excuses we came out really slow and san jose is a tough place to play
5028891 its tough it makes us have to switch guys around we got to pull guys we pulled jeff larentowiz and put him in the center back i just thought we never made them feel uncomfortable and that is something we need to work at
5028892 we are obviously very happy with the win the team has been building to a good performance and a lot of goals and it is good to finally get it especially against a very good team its one game but i am very pleased with the guys tonight
5028893 i think it is our best performance of the year we had a sticky situation in the first 20 minutes of the second half when we couldnt get it together but that is a good team we are playing to beat them at home is a great result for us mentally as well
5028894 the season is very long we are not out of the playoffs and we still have a chance to make it even after a couple of losses on the road we are still in there and now we havent lost in five games we won the last two and that is obviously good we have a tough stretch and we are still behind that is what we have to take on board and make sure we dont get carried away with this one result
5028895 bringing in these new players has really given us a boost going forward we have so many different types of attacking players and that creates problems for our opponents we are feeling confident up front right now
5028896 new england put it to us back there earlier this year so it was good to come out and show that we are a good side hopefully this win will get us started so we can make a push for the playoffs we played well tonight and we need to continue this next week against chivas
5028897 i am really enjoying it right now the team has been playing very well the past few games and we are working well together it is not too often that you can beat a very good side like new england 4 0
5028898 i love to attack and i have been playing this way for 16 years and i still have a job so i guess it is working i think that my style suits mls
5028899 we are not surprised by the result tonight we have been playing well recently and the team has been defending well all year we are happy with this win but we need to keep going
5028900 the whole goal is always to make the playoffs and win the championship that is true for every team and we are not giving up because we are at the bottom of the table right now we have a lot of home games and if we keep playing well we have a shot
5028901 i didnt score the first few games but i felt like i was contributing and playing well tonight the goal came for me darren huckerby gave me a great pass and i just had to finish

5028913 i dont know why i asked he knows what he needs to do to conserve his energy
5028914 we were giving him support letting him know how proud we were and that we stand behind him whatever the outcome might be
5028915 for this to happen everything had to fall into perfect place
5028916 if we had to do this again i dont know if it would happen exactly the way we wanted it to
5028917 i am so blessed so privileged to be here to watch him swim live
5028918 i thought maybe hes not as focused in the schoolhouse but i saw a love and passion for swimming in him at a young age
5028919 he could be there for hours during a swim meet
5028920 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step

5028930 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5028931 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5028932 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5028933 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5028934 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5028935 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5028936 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5028937 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement
5028938 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5028939 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit

5028954 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5028955 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5028956 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5028957 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato

5028964 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5028965 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
5028966 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5028967 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraines national security in such situations

5029223 they showed good fitness levels at the end and tackled well throughout the game were still in the hunt and today was certainly a step in the right direction

5029230 she took every opportunity she had to come in and make me play one more shot or one more passing shot
5029231 thats the way it is i got four matches in this week which is what i was looking for it would have been great to play five but ill go to new haven hoping to find a little more rhythm and build up to the us open
5029232 the longer the rallies went the worse i felt i felt like i didnt have any coordination whatever they gave me really helped
5029233 i think she was hoping i would keep making the same mistakes
5029234 you could see her starting to get frustrated i expected to have a much harder time with her
5029235 just to be able to get the top seed and not have to face the americans til the gold medal game is huge
5029236 in the second half belgium played poorly and we played better
5029237 when we first started out with this business which we opened at selegie customers frequented us because they found our chicken rice chili sauce good i was then preparing the sauces till we decided to expand our business to balmoral plaza
5029238 after our expansion which was a year after we started out venture i decided to move over to run the balmoral outlet thats when business here at selegie started to take a downturn as the sauces and dishes prepared by my partner differed alot in taste than mine so while business at balmoral remained healthy business at selegie dropped
5029239 since ive been in this line for a substantive number of years i might as well continue running it and push to perfect the quality of my rice chicken and chili

5029242 our concern for the iraqi people in phases convention which had not yet been completed are optimistic about adding to the achievements of iraq concerning the convention
5029243 the current year will be the last to the presence of the multinational force after the completion of the agreement on security agreement with the united states which would allow u
5029244 many points in the convention iraqi security had reached agreement with the american side
5029245 iraqi government to seek continued negotiated under the framework of the constitution and the consent of all political blocs in the country
5029246 that iraq is not obliged to inform any of the neighboring countries or territory any of the specific issues and the only concern the iraqi government because they familiarized them with terms of the agreement and security is the iraqi people as the holder the right to know the details of the convention which the government hopes to understand iraqis future directions of the country which proved it
5029247 good who is trying the iraqi government through them maintaining iraqs sovereignty unity and reaffirmed its commitment to national principles that are installed in the security agreement with the united states
5029248 targeting any party whatsoever of a multinational force pursuant to fall under the threat of terrorism and gives the right for the government to respond to them as they deem appropriate so as to ensure the security situation in the country

5029252 i came to be part of the crowd to show local virginia politicians that we are here and want to be taken seriously for the issues that affect us
5029253 this year there is a high likelihood a small number of voters in northern virginia will elect the next president
5029254 given that scenario i think 71 000 voters is a substantial bloc that could swing things in one direction or the other
5029255 these people they may look a little different they may talk a little different but they want a better america and they have the same concerns as other americans
5029256 we really want to stand up for people who are going to support the community

5029260 when i started there was a white workforce now little has changed
5029261 because of the talent not because the actor fits one stereotype or another
5029262 because they have cable and satellite television as well as the internet where they can find programs addressed to them
5029263 is not the right thing to do but the thing that gives money
5029264 is not about do gooders anymore because were in business
5029265 someone with more talent couldnt maybe have a job because the post is reserved for a minority

5029297 i couldnt care about my highlights but watching him was unforgettable
5029298 in the last few years through all his success ive never seen him change
5029299 thats not something i thought about once the race was over
5029300 the way the games are falling the sides that needed to win did win and were one of those sides
5029301 were not a side that can be complacent about anything you guys talk us up and we talk ourselves down
5029302 it keeps us up there with three games to go theres six points to go and hopefully we can get them
5029303 ive been eating my mums lasagne two nights before the game for the last 10 years so it might just be kicking in i guess
5029304 over the last few years ive played a good game and then had a few bad games but this year ive been more consistent people seem to see that more when you play consistent football and thats why everyone is giving me a few raps
5029305 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
5029306 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
5029307 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
5029308 this whole process is about sharing power mr mugabe will be head of state and mr tsvangirai will be head of government with executive power
5029309 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home
5029310 its hard for the springboks now to win the tournament but hence their likely response as a result of today
5029311 they are world champions and there is no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss you cant hide it will be a great opportunity coming at the end of the week it will only be what we make of it
5029312 it was great to be there it was great to be able to witness it live the score appears to be one sided but the contest itself was very much anything but that
5029313 and the first half was probably the biggest indicator of that there was an awful amount of rugby played in that first half but there was very little to show for it it was 5 0 on the scoreboard at half time
5029314 the all blacks got home and they played well they absorbed the pressure and there was a significant amount of pressure from the boks
5029315 they absorbed that and took the points not always by the boot but they were able to score three tries and that was the difference
5029316 there were times they survived on defence when there was probably no other side in the world that would have because the boks did bring a lot of pressure to bear and it looked on occasions like scoring was inevitable but they hung in there and they defended very well
5029317 both sides had a huge intensity it was only late in the game when the game got away from the springboks that they were forced to play a game that they werent really that comfortable with and it cost them
5029318 most of these callers are from design and printing houses trying to offer me a position as a graphic designer in their company but i was unwilling to accept their offers because i know these guys are looking for cheap labourers who are also all rounders
5029319 i would prefer to work for an agency which values my services alongside providing me with better pay learning experience and job advancement opportunities that way ill be motivated to work harder and produce quality work which will do the company good
5029320 clients do not know how the production process work and how tedious it is to create a flash icon from start thats why they think since were trained designers were able to solve the problem fast thats unreasonable
5029321 whatever the case is design and employment is largely dependent on our economic situation theres no escape
5029322 also those who wish to study design please think twice about it dont do it for interest sake
5029323 it was rather the interesting design colour and style which spewed my attention and interests towards the fashion
5029324 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5029325 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5029326 it was a flagrant and a blatant false start that was not recalled and had tremendous impact on the race
5029327 but theyre not going to rerun the olympic 100 anyone who knows anything knows that
5029328 it would be great if you could tell your readers that we have an online store locator available at online store where we offer free samples we do charge for shipping and handling though and with gas the way it is it is not cheap we are rushing to sign up more and more stores we are over 800 now but we have a long way to go fans can help us by printing and taking our get my zevia form to their local store grocery managers are very responsive to consumer requests
5029329 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5029330 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5029331 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5029332 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment

5029334 a mim n o me incomoda nada ter perdido a solidariedade de um clube e ter ganho a de outro porque n o preciso dela para nada nunca precisei e como treinador do vit ria a nica solidariedade que preciso a que me dada todos os dias pela minha direc o acho interessante que os clubes designados grandes andem atr s da solidariedade de outros clubes e que andem a correr de um lado para outro s para aparecerem na fotografia isso que eu acho engra ado mas se calhar neste pa s toda a gente acha isso normal o vit ria para ficar no seu lugar entre os primeiros lugares do campeonato n o precisa de ningu m a n o ser dos seus adeptos dos seus dirigentes e dos seus jogadores
5029335 este clube de facto muito grande ao ponto de outros clubes se encostarem a n s porque sentem que a nossa grandeza lhes pode ser til mas aten o que o vit ria grande sozinho n o precisa de companhias deste ou daquele para ser grande nunca precisou em 86 anos de hist ria n o precisa de alian as de amigos nem de inimigos e eu sei que a direc o pensa o mesmo esta direc o move se pelos interesses do clube e se numa dada altura eles s o coincidentes com outros clubes pois bem h um trabalho conjunto a fazer
5029336 o vit ria n o perde identidade nestas ocasi es como outros clubes que se agarram a estas alian as para poderem aparecer um bocadinho lamentavelmente para esses clubes esta grandeza do vit ria conquista se n o se compra por isso que h outros clubes que at gostariam de jogar no nosso est dio para terem um ambiente como o nosso mas n o t m porque a rela o dos adeptos com o clube n o se explica nem se exporta uma coisa que se sente que deve ter uma explica o sociol gica e que n o merece a pena ser copiada porque ser sempre uma tentativa falhada
5029337 o conhecimento que tenho do futebol portugu s e porque toda a gente me diz que esta poca o vit ria deve preparar se para ser o bombo da festa dos rbitros
5029338 recordo que na poca passada no campeonato come mos com tr s empates e todos diziam que n o ganh vamos a ningu m esta poca est a passar se o mesmo alguns maus resultados na pr epoca e um empate com o basileia e j suficiente para os doutores do futebol se intranquilizarem tenham calma que eu tamb m tenho a equipa boa melhor do que a do ano passado e tem um potencial tremendo
5029339 as pessoas dizem me que se n o passarmos a eliminat ria da champions league uma frustra o pois se acontecer que seja seria uma frustra o bonita em 86 anos de exist ncia nunca tiveram uma frustra o igual a esta o vit ria n o p ra a se for eliminado mas o vit ria n o vai ser eliminado
5029340 em primeiro lugar devo dizer que os adeptos do vit ria s o nicos s o uma coisa fant stica
5029341 queles gajos que escrevem em jornais e que dizem certas e determinadas coisas nas r dios e televis es
5029342 para a comunica o social s existam tr s grandes que hipocrisia escrevem sempre que o futebol portugu s n o cresce com esta macrocefalia mas depois s o eles que n o deixam os outros crescer mas quer queiram ou n o o vit ria um grande o futebol portugu s s tinha a ganhar se o nosso campeonato em vez de ter tr s grandes tivesse quatro cinco seis sete grandes

5029348 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5029349 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5029350 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5029351 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5029352 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

5029362 dan ketika rabb mu hendak mengeluarkan keturunan bani adam dari sulbi mereka dan allah telah mengambil kesaksian atas nafs nafs mereka bukankah aku ini rabb mu
5029363 yang demikian itu disebabkan oleh karena mereka mencintai kehidupan dunia di atas akhirat mereka itulah yang qalb pendengaran dan penglihatannya telah dikunci mati oleh allah dan mereka adalah orang orang yang lalai
5029364 terangkanlah kepadaku tentang orang yang menjadikan hawanya sebagai tuhannya maka apakah kamu dapat menjadi pemelihara atasnya atau apakah kamu mengira bahwa kebanyakan mereka itu mendengar atau memahami mereka itu tidak lain bagaikan ternak bahkan lebih tersesat jalannya
5029365 dan barang siapa buta di dunia ini maka di akhirat akan buta pula dan lebih tersesat jalannya

5029367 jangan tidak enggak usah kamu maksa telpon dia enggak akan ada gunanya kamu pikir itu akan menyelesesaikan masalah
5029368 kenapa kenapa a larang aku hubungi dia jika bukan karena aku tak mungkin tragedi ini terjadi jika saja a ijinkan aku berbicara padanya barang sebentar saja maka aku akan meminta maaf atau a sudi mempertemukan aku dengannya tentu aku akan bersimpuh mencium tangan dan memohon ampunan atas segala kesalahanku padanya
5029369 ahirnya aku benar benar harus lari meninggalkan semua meninggalkan semua yang telah aku susun sejak tiga tahun lalu ini adalah pilihanku lain tidak
5029370 ya barang kali inilah nasib yang telah terukir di atas garis tanganku aku tak menyesal sungguh
5029371 jadi kamu telah tega meninggalkan janti wanita yang telah tiga tahun menjalin hubungan kasih bukankah baru tiga minggu yang lalu kamu menikahinya
5029372 tidak bukan aku yang tega aku tak mungkin tega meninggalkannya sekalipun kau tahu rasa cintaku telah sempurna pada saat pernikahan itu berlangsung dan habis sama sekali pada janti tapi aku tak mungkin tega meninggalkan janti
5029373 ketahuilah rin sesungguhnya rasa cintaku sebagai lelaki pada janti sebagai wanita telah sempurna bahkan hilang sama sekali sejak aku mengenalmu pada ahir desember lalu tapi percayalah rin aku juga tidak mungkin tega meninggalkan janti
5029374 sudahlah a aku bukan mahasiswa semester empat yang masih lugu aku juga bukan perempuan yang tidak punya perasaan cepatlah kau ngomong terus terang atau aku nekad menemui janti
5029375 rin kamu tak usahlah menyalahkan diri sendiri apalagi keputusan ini aku ambil semata mata bukan karena kau ya memang rasa cintaku sebagai lelaki pada janti telah sirna berganti rasa sayang seorang kakak pada adiknya dan kini rasa cinta itu telah beralih pada kamu rin tapi apa yang telah terjadi memang benar benar bukan karena kamu juga bukan karena aku yang tega meninggalkan janti
5029376 sudahlah aku bosan berputar putar aira kenapa kamu tak bilang langsung

5029386 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
5029387 a lot of evil has been perpetrated uh based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5029388 does evil exist and if so should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5029389 i must confess that i have read the book the holy bible so i know how this one comes out eventually evil lucifer is chained up for 1 000 years and when freed of his confinement he goes right back to his old ways and he is then destroyed but until christ comes back to deal with evil we definitely should not ignore evil negotiate with it or attempt to contain it we may not be able to defeat it but we should do everything we can do to oppose and try to defeat evil until reinforcements arrive on a white horse

5029433 this book will be an invaluable tool for mental health professionals working in inpatient settings and will hopefully inspire people to increase access to such approaches and conduct the research required to firmly establish the evidence base
5029434 isabel clarke and hannah wilson have addressed the difficult political strategic and organisational issues which limit the availability of cbt and related psychological therapies in inpatient settings in doing so they draw upon on a broad evidence base a depth of clinical experience and self reflective and compassionate commitment to an often marginalised group of service users and a frequently demoralised group of mental health staff

5029437 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5029438 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5029439 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5029440 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5029441 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5029442 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5029443 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5029444 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5029445 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5029446 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5029447 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5029448 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5029449 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5029450 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5029451 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5029452 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5029453 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5029454 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5029455 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5029456 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5029457 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5029458 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5029459 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5029460 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5029461 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5029462 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5029463 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5029464 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5029465 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5029466 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5029467 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5029468 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5029469 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5029470 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

5029489 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes
5029490 generally speaking chinese athletes are not strong contenders in many events in the second half of the games
5029491 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5029492 today i had a revelation from the lord and because of that i now realize that my positions on abortion have been totally wrong so tonight i ask america to forgive me for my backing of abortion in the past im so sorry furthermore i promise to be a pro life advocate from this day forward

5029505 i felt the pilgrims pride arrests were justified and there should be even more enforcement of illegal workers in the u s along with stiffer penalties and quicker deportation
5029506 i was concerned and somewhat surprised that there were so many agencies and organizations rushing in to try to support the families of these criminals
5029507 maybe these organizations need to be concerned with the law abiding citizens and the families that are trying to work according to the laws of our land and

5029510 the fta should be fully and successfully implemented in the first instance
5029511 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
5029512 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
5029513 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
5029514 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
5029515 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up

5029528 organizers ran out of prophylactics at the 2000 sydney games which forced athens organizers to nearly double the total available to 130 000 four years later
5029529 you were going at least 75 in a 55 zone
5029530 im also going to give you a ticket for your broken tail light
5029531 broken tail light i didnt know about a broken tail light
5029532 oh harry youve known about that tail light for weeks
5029533 im also going to give you a citation for not wearing your seat belt
5029534 oh i just took it off when you were walking up to the car
5029535 maam does your husband talk to you this way all the time
5029536 i think that there are better choices for sen mccain than mitt romney that will have the approval of values voters
5029537 there is absolutely no issue about mitt romneys religion i have never said that
5029538 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column
5029539 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
5029540 if tom ridge is on the ticket i will not be voting republican
5029541 they gave it an old time feel and experimented by putting it in the middle of a downtown environment
5029542 to me whats so amazing about the number is that other ballparks that have been built since are not on pace to reach 50 million in 17 seasons
5029543 its a ballpark that attracts tourists from other parts of the country and while theyre here they spend money in baltimore
5029544 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5029545 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5029546 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5029547 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5029548 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5029549 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5029550 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5029551 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5029552 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5029553 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5029554 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5029555 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5029556 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5029557 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
5029558 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
5029559 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money

5029565 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country

5029568 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving

5029573 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues

5029576 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time

5029739 many of my students are either first generation college students students from middle to lower income families or both they are struggling to afford college as it is often having to work off campus which then affects their class performance and it really pains me to see textbook companies charge more and more for a less and less useful product
5029740 poorly written chaotically organized and full of so many irrelevant graphical elements and sidebars
5029741 in my abstract algebra course last fall i used no textbook but rather homemade course notes and a handful of helpful web sites
5029742 imagine having a calculus textbook the contributors to which are some of the best calculus professors in practice today and which includes not only text material but also links to web sites embedded video interactive applets for visual kinesthetic learners and user contributed problem sets for free
5029743 theres a stigma against such things now just as there is a continuing stigma against wikipedia in academia because academicians have a hard time accepting the legitimacy of something that is not peer reviewed but i think once students start learning and getting engaged with material through these things that stigma will go away quickly

5029754 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
5029755 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
5029756 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
5029757 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable action in china
5029758 tibet is part of china and the whole world recognizes it the free tibet movement is not welcome here a small number of people are trying to split the territory and that is not going to work at all

5029764 the diary itself is hugely significant as the personal diary of major lee who led the regiment fighting the boer war
5029765 but at the back of the diary there are a series of handwritten poems signed banjo paterson

5029781 i abhor discrimination based on age psychologists and psychotherapists all over the world plead for a society where adults and teenagers kids and old people mix up seperation based on age creates social stupidity ignorance and mental illness where generations learn from each other social intelligence rises this is the state of science today
5029782 perhaps if there were a system of sanctions against filers of false abuse reports a faster turnaround time requiring less sensitive personal rl documentation to clear ones name benchmarks to show that the system is working or not greater communication and sympathy from linden lab or if they would at least work on weekends for crying out loud i would change my mind about this

5029789 i think john mccains reaction to what happened in russia did not reflect well on the position he should have taken and that is one of understanding we have one president in this country and that secretary of state rice and president bush need the support of both presidential candidates in a very tricky time as it relates to russia and the neighboring states that are trying to establish democracies
5029790 i think him doing press releases and sending some of his political allies to georgia i think some of it began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5029791 they accused barack obama of being presumptuous for going to europe and meeting with our allies
5029792 what is presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now
5029793 we hope that mr gambari would be able to revive the stalled dialogue

5029865 they just kind of wander around looking at these shabby old buildings and think how do people live like this
5029866 we have to be really careful about respecting the communities whats important is communication between the ship and the community to have equal benefit

5029868 it brings in a big influx of cash in the summer

5029873 generally speaking the yields are better than they were last year and we have the makings of a good year but we still need to see this harvest weather and what kind of quality we get because that influences the prices the farmers receive
5029874 the quality prospects look fairly good but it is still a little too early to predict the forecast is favourable at the moment
5029875 it all depends on where there have been rain showers
5029876 it will be at least average in terms of yields there is strong demand right now and that is always good news for growers
5029877 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5029878 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

5029901 despite the fact that studies on the dangers of pathological gaming and its treatments were known the defendant didnt consider its obligation to warn users of the dangers of dependence
5029902 at the current time there exists no expert recognized by his peers who proposes that vlts are the cause of pathological gambling
5029903 in using the message in moderation a game remains a game the defendant puts the responsibility of pathological gambling on the user

5029911 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5029912 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5029913 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5029914 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5029915 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time

5029927 mum can purchase and prepare the food but dads will often have less greens or just meat and potato the kids think mum makes me eat this and she is painted as the bad guy
5029928 fathers influence the food and physical activity habits in the home through their behaviours attitudes and approach to food and eating and act as a role model to their children
5029929 these dads are still allowed to have a beer and enjoy things in moderation it was subtle changes to their nutritional habits that made the difference they see their lives change they sleep better and have much more fun together
5029930 i enjoy fatherhood very much apart from my wife they are my two best friends i hope they still use me as a guide as they grow up
5029931 it will be interesting to see the report given the criticism by the government of the regional partnerships program given that not one of the better regions grants has gone through any probity checks and balances and every single one of them was a pre election promise in labor and marginal seats
5029932 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5029933 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5029934 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5029935 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet

5029939 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5029940 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5029941 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5029942 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5029943 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5029944 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5029945 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5029946 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5029947 garanto que n o conhe o melhor defini o de agosto sabemos como come a mas ningu m sabe como que acaba
5029948 he doesnt get flustered and come unglued when something bad happens normally in a game something bad is going to happen
5029949 he has shown tremendous poise youre a rookie you come in here from college and youre playing tackle and youre moving to center and then youre right guard and then youre left guard youre going up against this defense and the multiplicity that they have were audibling were changing plays
5029950 there would be disappointment if he didnt do as well
5029951 we scouted him well some guys are robotic he just gets it dont send him to the hall of fame yet but for right now the arrow is pointing in the right direction
5029952 i know thats one of the things that separates people in the nfl how they are from the neck up im just trying to focus on that aspect a lot because everybody is physically talented so thats whats going to separate you from the next man
