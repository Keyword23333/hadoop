3730066 and so when the action in georgia happened on thursday he immediately called for a ceasefire condemned the unwarranted use of force by russia it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev

3730094 there was a lot of grease up in there that caught fire
3730095 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3730096 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3730097 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3730098 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3730099 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3730100 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3730101 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3730102 based on the true story of the 1971 baker street bank robbery which was prevented from being told for over thirty years because of a government gagging order the real story of how one of the biggest robberies in british history took place with no arrests ever made nor money ever recovered

3730106 those new fans and old alike will return to the original film to enjoy and participate with the exceptional and timeless performances of tim curry richard obrien susan sarandon and the entire cast
3730107 so here we go again with a new cast believing that the sky and mtv remake will add to the rocky horror phenomenon

3730109 i have no proof so i cant make an affirmation
3730110 but it possibly could be true that doesnt give an even playing field
3730111 i spent to get my taxes done because for entertainers and authors taxes are a very complicated thing i now realize that my taxes were even more complicated than i thought and i should have spent to get them done properly had i done so i would have paid cite difference but i would have saved myself in penalties i learned my lesson from that you need to spend money to save money sometimes just like with our infrastructure our streets highways and bridges

3730114 history holds some lessons on what happens when the banking system is impaired
3730115 in the early 1990s u s commercial banks suffered from capital inadequacy and the u s economy suffered from bank credit inadequacy
3730116 throughout the decade of the 1990s japanese banks suffered from capital inadequacy and the japanese economy suffered from bank credit inadequacy
3730117 were working our way into prime mortgages credit cards car loans and commercial mortgages
3730118 what i or you may want is irrelevant the feds proposal has drawn nearly 56 000 comments yet the fed isnt compelled to read a single one of them you see the fed is acting without congressional authority two weeks ago a congressional committee reported out a credit cardholders bill of rights with many of the features of the feds regulation but the banking industry mounted such a lobbying effort against it theres no way it will get enacted this year or maybe ever in other words congress is so immobilized we have to rely on the fed which operates mostly in secret whose chair is appointed every four years but whose other governors have fourteen year terms and which doesnt even depend on a congressional appropriation for its own funding but draws interest on the portfolio of treasury securities it controls this isnt chinese type authoritarian capitalism of course but nor is it strictly speaking what weve come to expect from a democracy
3730119 his roots to basic american culture and values are at best limited
3730120 i cannot imagine america electing a president at a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and values
3730121 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3730122 if hillary clinton had done that she would permanently besmirch her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3730123 i think the safety issue is one thats being stressed but its just an engineering problem and an engineering challenge
3730124 we have to go through it and be rigorous but its just like numerous other challenges on the car
3730125 we will all be trying to overheat or overcharge batteries
3730126 those who will use flywheels will all be trying to crash flywheels
3730127 it is still possible but clearly very tight to get something from the system at the start of the season
3730128 first we have to see in the car what is the actual performance gain because there is this extra power from kers but also more weight or less ballast so it will always be a trade off
3730129 at amp t and verizon dream of those kinds of penetration numbers
3730130 i think its a real success story theyre competing with the largest cable operator in nasdaq cmcsa cmcsk and have seen pretty good progress
3730131 it was clear to our team that network improvements were necessary to take full advantage of the demand for high quality iptv and the rising demand for video access across the internet
3730132 it was traditional video at the time but it gave us a kick start on the video side of things and we re encapsulated that video into ip form
3730133 in the sacramento market in particular where weve done a lot of network expansions our plan is to really increase the penetration on existing homes passed
3730134 ive always done pre seasons in dribs and drabs ive started one and then pulled up sore or ive broken down or been on a modified pre season but this year ive started to string games together and im not pulling up sore and not missing training at all
3730135 i got to the bottom of my injury i had a weak core ive got a very mobile pelvis and im very mobile through my hips which creates a lot of stress and strain in that region thats where ive got a lot of soreness from with bone damage and osteitis pubis
3730136 all of my muscles werent firing the right way and this put a lot of stress on my groin and lower back and thats where i was breaking down its taken five years to get to the bottom of it but ive finally figured out what works and what doesnt work
3730137 not completing all of those pre seasons you start behind the eight ball i wish i couldve figured out what it was three or four years ago and maybe things wouldve been different but im still young enough at 22 so hopefully ive got five to eight years of good footy left in me
3730138 ive got really weak glutes so i havent done a lot of leg weights because ive had such problems with my groin and lower back so squats and dead lifts have been out of my training program
3730139 i was pulling up really sore in my lower back from squats but ive been using a belt in the last six weeks and im starting to see some really good signs
3730140 brett burton was using it for quite some time so i gave brett a call and asked how does it go does it work for you and how long have you been using it he really rated it a lot and the first game i played i could really see the difference and its been a real key ingredient for getting better but the body had to adjust too
3730141 ive been happy in patches and thats been the case throughout my footy career consistency is the biggest question for me at the moment but im starting to get a little bit of consistency under my belt
3730142 im not happy with where im at at the moment and ive got high expectations on myself to be a lot further ahead i mightve had a few setbacks along the way but im not going to use them as excuses
3730143 thats something ive got to take in my stride you can do 10 good things in life and one bad thing and thats what people remember you for and youve got to do another 10 good things to earn that respect back
3730144 im just trying to put my head down do the right thing focus on my footy keep continuing to improve as a person and as a player
3730145 probably the nut bolts of the door were loose and it fell when it was struck with something in the tunnel between central secretariat and patel chowk metro station the train was immediately stopped and control room was informed about the incident
3730146 it could have been a major tragedy however on this line most of the passengers board the train at rajiv chowk there were only around 300 passengers inside the train
3730147 there was some problem with a door of the train however there is no report of door felling on the track
3730148 unlike other temples the devotees here can interact with the god as they pour out their grievances to a tastefully decorated muthappan theyyam an artist who assumes divinity by representing the god the theyyam responds with convincing solutions which the devotees consider sacred and that of the god the theyyam then parts with the liquor and elderly male devotees take it as nectar while the other offerings are given to dogs considered the lords pet animal

3730152 the project cannot be undertaken just like that a concrete and comprehensive plan has to be prepared it has to be debated and then has to take off using minimum space in majestic the public is not aware about the development
3730153 its wrong to start work without bringing it to public notice as kempegowda bus terminal is a unique structure and an important landmark they cant demolish it officials have to take people into confidence which they havent if that is the case we will move court
3730154 we have started work on the project after consultations with the public representatives shifting work has begun construction will also begin after the structure shape is finalized
3730155 we are having talks with private companies who are interested in taking up this initiative under ppp public private partnership
3730156 for my soul delighteth in the song of the heart yea the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads
3730157 music can be used to exalt and inspire or to carry messages of degradation and destruction it is therefore important that as latter day saints we at all times apply the principles of the gospel and seek the guidance of the spirit in selecting the music with which we surround ourselves
3730158 i think for a big city like nottingham the civic side of things is really important to a lot of people

3730196 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3730197 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3730198 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3730199 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3730200 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3730201 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate

3730244 the worst hit industrial sectors are tourism fruit hosiery carpets handicrafts dry fruits tourism forest based products and herbs and herbal products
3730245 in the last one and half months exports fell by at least 30 per cent because of the agitation which has brought the movement of goods particularly fruits to a virtual halt
3730246 if the agitation goes on the economy of the state will suffer major jolt as people who had lined up over rs 5000 crore worth of investment for fiscal 2008 09 will depart to the neighbouring states of punjab haryana and himachal pradesh
3730247 agitations of this nature discourage investors and therefore peace and tranquillity must prevail in the state to ensure that its industrial prospects are not derailed

3730261 im optimistic that we can do that were going to beat the democrats big here in el paso county
3730262 were not fooling ourselves but we feel an obligation to wait for the rural counties
3730263 when we campaigned in those counties we vowed to listen to the people
3730264 he was trying to get his point across as a republican by pitting the democrats and the republicans sides as too different
3730265 my experience has been a lot of people want to talk about energy and gas prices my goal was to give constituents my plan on the issue and have them leave better informed
3730266 it wasnt me driving the issue it was me answering questions
3730267 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was

3730279 federal grants to state and local governments a brief history
3730280 president franklin pierce 1853 1857 vetoed an 1854 act supported by reformer dorothea dix to allocate funds to states to help the indigent insane pierce contended that if
3730281 congress is to make provision for paupers the fountains of charity will be dried up at home and the several states instead of bestowing their own means on the social wants of their people will become humble suppliants beggars for the bounty of the federal government reversing their true relation to this union
3730282 the 17 percent competitive advantage on average of foreign producers is eliminated immediately boosting u s competitiveness overseas american companies doing business internationally are able to sell their goods at lower prices but at similar margins and this brings jobs to america
3730283 imports and domestic production are on a level playing field exported goods are not subject to the fairtax since they are not consumed in the u s but imported goods sold in the u s are subject to the fairtax because these products are consumed domestically
3730284 just tax the evil corporations to pay for universal health care

3730299 to guarantee and consolidate the gains of the last few years we must follow through with the application of the reforms
3730300 if you do not have advocacy then no change happens because institutions are always reluctant to change
3730301 ideas coming through the media and especially satellite television are affecting us
3730302 in morocco most of the people discussing womens rights in the media have conservative interpretations of the law there is an absence of progressive voices
3730303 political discourse in egypt is dominated by the conservative polemics of the islamists
3730304 moves back and forth between secular values and religious and traditional principles
3730305 they are very strong they know the culture they know the religious context in which they live and can use either universal human rights arguments or religious arguments for their cause
3730306 to succeed we must find clerics with progressive interpretations of the koran to support us
3730307 we needed society to understand that the conservative clerics were not the sole interpreters of islam
3730308 i was born and grew up in a part of the world where life is supposed to be hard for most people but harder for women in fact i come from two parts of the world africa and the arab muslim world
3730309 address issues that are at the core of social life
3730310 when the present tunisian government allowed a woman to pass on her citizenship to her children this created a seismic cultural change in the society
3730311 traditionally citizenship as well as all other legal rights was passed on through the fathers side by permitting citizenship to pass through the mothers line as well the law challenged the entire patrilineal concept of the family
3730312 then it was very different at that time women did not have any power over their own lives
3730313 what we have seen is a change in the law not a change in society however changes in law allow for changes to occur in the society
3730314 the law has made a difference in countries like tunisia where reforms happened in the 1950s there we have had a length of time to see the changes we know now that when the laws change women are able to file for divorce more easily and custody is easier
3730315 what the law does not change is the social situation
3730316 socially divorce remains very difficult they divorced women suffer economically and they find themselves treated as outcasts
3730317 the business of writing the law applying the law and interpreting the law in the arab world is governed above all by a male oriented culture
3730318 the injustices against women in personal status matters without infringing upon the principles of sharia
3730319 we can no longer say that in the muslim world it is hard to change womens rights
3730320 women have really gained very significant rights in tunisia and morocco
3730321 we need to move away from the generalized statements about that part of the world and come up with a more nuanced way of looking at it
3730322 once we see the diversity of the experiences of women in the muslim world and see that some women have gained substantial rights we can learn from those cases
3730323 for most people to change them is to question a fundamental piece of the religion in contrast marital and divorce laws in the koran are less explicit therefore much more fluid and open to varying interpretations
3730324 even though it is also performed by egyptian christians and is not practiced in most muslim countries outside the nile valley
3730325 now we have to do the same at the local level
3730326 we hope to get it entrenched in the law we have to also ensure that the changes will be real effective and institutionalized

3730331 suppliers cut stocks suddenly by half and we were running at a loss of 20 000 a month for two months we were afraid we would totally run out

3730336 i would love for there to be a simpler solution if we could just tick a box and move on it would make everyones life easier but now this really is a long term behavioural and educational campaign
3730337 we looked at things like doctors certification and body mass index and decided that for us it wasnt the appropriate recommendation we felt it was wrong to force a girl to have a physical examination especially because the signs of a problem arent always obvious

3730347 police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government

3730375 existing law provides that a trust for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal may be performed by the trustee for the life of the animal whether or not there is a beneficiary who can seek enforcement or termination of the trust and whether or not the terms of the trust contemplate a longer duration
3730376 this bill would repeal the provisions regarding domestic or pet animal trusts and would provide instead that a trust for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal is for a lawful noncharitable purpose and terminates when no designated animal is living on the date of the settlors death unless otherwise provided in the trust the bill would require a court to liberally construe a pet trust to bring it within the bills provisions to presume against an interpretation that would render the disposition a mere request or an attempt to honor the pet and to carry out the general intent of the trust

3730401 its a very sad loss and to learn of that this morning makes me deeply saddened for johns family his death means the loss of a good friend and a good colleague and it is very upsetting for all of us here in fife that we have lost someone who has dedicated all of his adult life to serving the labour party he was someone who i grew to both like and admire over the years because he was so committed to what he was doing john had above all a caring attitude but he also had a very good sense of humour and that sense of humour always helped to cut through many difficult political situations i always admire people who have got the ability for humour and john certainly did have that in abundance
3730402 i have known john for over 20 years and am deeply saddened that his long fight against illness has ended as a councillor the leader of fife council and an mp he has left a legacy and will be missed by many people my thoughts are with his wife and family who supported him throughout his long illness
3730403 john was a kind and decent man who dedicated to the service of the people of fife with distinguished service both in parliament and local government i have greatly admired the way in which he has borne such a debilitating illness with enormous courage my thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time
3730404 both as a councillor and as a member of parliament john macdougall embodied the best traditions of public service his courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues my sympathy goes to his wife and family
3730405 willie harris is a patient hitter and he was leading off the inning feliciano has been very good for us he hasnt had a lot of glitches in his appearances i felt very comfortable with him he then goes to another right handed hitter and once you get the one guy i feel very confident that youll get the other guy i felt their strength was from the left side on the bench i did not want to start eddie with harris who i didnt think was a swing early guy you know had that lineup started out in the ninth with say ryan zimmerman and that group then kunz would have been the guy
3730406 with the way our bullpen has been pitching youve got to come ready to pitch every day so you cant really let yesterday bother today when we come in wednesday its going to be can the bullpen do it again so its a new day no matter what we did today
3730407 i think joe checked some of his films out he came up before in the dugout right before the national anthem and said hey im ready to go so i just wanted to send a little challenge out there hes had success against some of these hitters and he was very successful tonight

3730412 for a long time the government and people of kenya have not taken sports seriously and have not given it the attention it deserves
3730413 we now have a paradigm shift in the way we look at sports it sports will be a pillar in the kenyan economy in the coming years and thats why we have decided to join the team and inspire them at the olympic games
3730414 we want them to see how we and the people of kenya are now behind them every inch of the way
3730415 the garmin oregon 400t is an ideal companion for an active outdoor lifestyle
3730416 it doesnt come any bigger than a match between tusker and us i cannot say there is a big rivalry between tusker and mathare but given that we are both gunning for the title this match is definitely not going to be a friendly battle remember again that we beat them in the first leg
3730417 that is something we are not going to allow them we cannot give them another chance to run over us as they did in the first leg we are going for a win
3730418 all of us are eyeing the title a win will be of great advantage to us sony may also be a beneficiary but they also have to win their match
3730419 we believe we will be in the premier league next year the win over bandari has given us fresh impetus
3730420 a lot of us had similar ideas at the same time and we had some connection with each other
3730421 every single person involved in this is touched by this disease in one way or another
3730422 theres humor theres music theres film pieces theres lots and lots of celebrities
3730423 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop
3730424 clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players i dont like it its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players
3730425 benni is definitely one of them and theres plenty more as far as im concerned the situation is closed
3730426 theres always going to be speculation about players but i can categorically say 100 per cent that nobody will be leaving this club
3730427 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3730428 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3730429 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3730430 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
3730431 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscapewhat color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors
3730432 the unfortunate reality is that there will be some inconvenience caused to local football matches during the coming months as major construction on the stadia continues south african football will ultimately have world class facilities once the process is completed
3730433 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3730434 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3730435 the sample for this study was a low income population
3730436 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3730437 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3730438 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3730439 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
3730440 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
3730441 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3730442 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so

3730449 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3730450 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3730451 the results of those meetings will then be fed back to me and also to the icc vice president sharad pawar and icc chief executive haroon lorgat on 20 august so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3730452 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3730453 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3730454 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event
3730455 when people continue to die and the outbreak continues to spread then officials undertake late fire fighting measures to combat the outbreak
3730456 afterwards the officials forget what occurred and eventually wait for the next report of cholera due to the lack of a comprehensive control program such a pattern repeats itself time after time
3730457 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
3730458 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
3730459 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
3730460 for the first time we believe we make this distinction between the evolution of the genetic code codon discovery and the evolution of amino acid charging
3730461 the key for me tonight was being able to get ground balls i was able to get ahead in the count early and keep them off speed and as always when you get ground balls you rely on your defense to work behind you
3730462 i am not a power pitcher i know that i am not going to blow guys away i just try to get the batters off balance get ground balls and let the defense work behind me
3730463 its great we knew that we had a very strong relay
3730464 we wanted to confirm we are the strongest relay in the world
3730465 we will have to swim faster in the final though because it will take another world record to win
3730466 the risk obviously remains if the central bank was to ease policy in any way that would come back to haunt the forex market i guess if theres a massive recognition of easing of policy then inflation concern could come back to haunt markets and yields would pressure up
3730467 businesses still need to take into account the difficult operating environment that is likely to persist within the next six to 12 months which includes higher interest rates
3730468 the structural development membership of wto and an increasing willingness to open trade are offsetting the cyclical slowdown right now so if you look at export performance of vietnam in the past year or six months it is still expanding at 20 to 30 per cent

3730476 i believe in judicial restraint i believe a judge cannot bring an agenda to the bench the only way to resolve the complex issues that come before our states highest court is through an open mind independent thought and a willingness to debate the legal questions at stake

3730482 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3730483 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3730484 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3730485 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3730486 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3730487 has appropriately raised serious concerns about the safety of prescribing over the internet
3730488 outperformed the traditional system in most of the safety variables tested
3730489 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study
3730490 application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice
3730491 consider using the regulatory model of oversight protections implemented by the state of utah to license internet prescribing companies
3730492 one of the curious ironies of the nhs and many other health systems like it is that it does not pay enough attention to health focusing instead on ill health and disease the nhs diagnoses and treats rather than predicts and prevents
3730493 the government needs to shift this balance as the increasing cost of lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes obesity and some forms of cancer will prove financially unsustainable making the nhs unaffordable
3730494 changing peoples behaviour is difficult and merely giving people information and advice is known to be ineffective
3730495 bold action on the part of the government should include taking tough action to control levels of fat sugar and salt in foods as well as trying to narrow the income gap between rich and poor
3730496 the nhs faces some key wicked issues to which there are no easy or ready solutions these issues are very much focused on the way the health care is funded prioritised and managed and how it has evolved over the years
3730497 there is a fixation on the latest fads and fashion in management combined with a terror by target culture which has resulted in low staff morale and a breakdown in relations between clinicians and managers

3730500 the release of adalat xl plus responds directly to patients needs by improving ease of use enabling better patient compliance and most important resulting in better healthcare outcomes

3730506 this system is a perfect match to the sophisticated medical expertise currently in place at virginia hospital center
3730507 the agreements announced today equitably resolve our patent litigation regarding these two products in a way that benefits consumers and barrs shareholders
3730508 in addition the co promotion agreement creates significant opportunities for both barr and boehringer ingelheim adding a new product to durameds promotional portfolio and providing boehringer ingelheim with unique access to physicians in the womens health care area through the duramed sales force
3730509 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3730510 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3730511 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3730512 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3730513 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet

3730528 it is great to have andries there he is a really excellent line out forward and he is also playing well in other areas
3730529 andries has really used his chances well he is in great form and i have been impressed with how well he has played
3730530 obviously his line out ability brings an extra strength to the team for saturday
3730531 we will miss bakkies who has his own attributes that he brings to a game
3730532 but i really think this is a chance for andries to step in and show what he can do especially against a side like new zealand
3730533 shouldnt we be looking for an injunction from the international rugby board banning players from participating who are more than a certain height
3730534 we have normal sized players in our team but what is bekker eight foot seven
3730535 seriously though bekker has got it he is a great footballer he is not only good at the line out but also good in other areas too i think he is going to be a great international player
3730536 i think it will once again be a hard and physical test match
3730537 its going to be another great test match between two proud rugby nations and we just going to go out there to try and give each other our best as much as we possibly can
3730538 theres no doubt that this has been a wonderful tri nations series so far
3730539 this must be the closest the tournament has ever been between the three sides so were expecting another thriller in cape town
3730540 i do think though that we have a real chance of winning the tri nations and this is a very important game for us
3730541 so the newlands test is the only thing we focusing on not past results
3730542 its great for juan reaching his half century in the green and gold

3730618 oh i forgot one thing do you know god long story short i beat him in jeopardy about six years ago and now im immortal seriously i cant die subsequently last year he and i bet on the super bowl and i won again and now every time a woman gives me a blowjob he deposits 5000 in her bank account i cant believe i forgot about that he thought of that one
3730619 so is it like more or less than 50 push ups just give me a number here
3730620 no matter what happened i survived i endured and lived to tell about it and that counts for something probably very little but something
3730621 chubby 29 year old sad and wants to fuck you and your friend or whatever
3730622 el gobierno demuestra su clara apuesta por la insostenibilidad al aprobar un plan de medidas que promociona el crecimiento en detrimento del entorno
3730623 olvidarse de la obsesi n por el crecimiento y avanzar con el decrecimiento
3730624 recuperar el ritmo destructor del territorio que ha ocasionado la burbuja inmobiliaria
3730625 los beneficios del sector inmobiliario fueron privados y s lo beneficiaron a las grandes empresas del ramo y al sector de la poblaci n que pose a m s de una vivienda
3730626 improcedentes mientras el gobierno no haga los deberes y los grandes empresarios sigan con sus ganancias
3730627 los trabajadores no se pueden hacer cargo de la crisis
3730628 someone from our amazing top 6 is heading home this week
3730629 mitch theo and mookie you are all safe that means that earl amberly and drew you are tonights bottom 3
3730630 canada voted and the idol who received the fewest number of votes last night and is going home is amberly
3730631 alright canada youve got a top 5 and the idol mansion has become a frat house
3730632 yeah i think overall we have probably the most interesting top 5 weve ever had and probably the best musicians of any top 5 weve ever had
3730633 well its simple the same effort and dedication you put into this you take onto the next thing when you first auditioned for canadian idol you werent thinking this was my only shot in the world so you go out and do the next thing with the same effort same desires and same passion
3730634 i think one thing we havent seen yet and that is really important in the five is true spectacle weve had great singing great interpretations of songs but i dont think weve seen anybody do something completely radically visually outrageous and i think thats important
3730635 well actually our canadian tour starts in seven days starts on the 19th in st johns newfoundland and we go all across the country so check out the website
3730636 it was kind of weird at first we were a little bit nervous because we didnt know if we could do a good job of it but after earl went through we talked to the rest of the guys it was really easy they were all really nice and it just felt comfortable it was just a good time
3730637 this next decade is bound to be the elder care decade
3730638 people are working they live far away from their parents there are fewer siblings and they dont have support systems in place
3730639 only the big companies offer this and the majority of the american work force doesnt work for big companies so youre touching very few lives when it comes to this issue
3730640 i ran out to where my mother lives in new jersey while my daughter was giving birth in pennsylvania the stress was so unbelievable that i could feel my blood boiling
3730641 my own life has become hell because im constantly making choices who should i take care of first my grandchildren my mother or my husband
3730642 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3730643 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3730644 ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show than i have with senator obama
3730645 i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3730646 la disapprovazione comprensibile stata una brutta partita ma un buon risultato

3730651 as boomers age this issue will become even more important
3730652 employers will have to have resources in place like flextime and programs to help caregivers at a distance or else productivity will go down
3730653 employees are then able to focus on their role at work rather than spend time doing the research themselves
3730654 people are afraid that when their companies are downsizing theyll be remembered for taking time off to care for their mother
3730655 it would be nice to work in an environment where people understand your challenges where your boss understands
3730656 the calgary police service takes any allegations of criminal activity misconduct or improper behaviour against its officers very seriously

3730666 g8 countries have done little to show how they will fund the shortfall of 40 billion in programmable aid and debt relief the g8 has yet to present clear timetables outlining future aid provision or to provide increased transparency required to improve the quality of aid
3730667 the panel welcomes the commitment of 10 billion 5 1 billion to support food aid and measures to increase agricultural input as a necessary first step more needs to be done however to increase the supply of food to the worlds most vulnerable citizens and immediate measures must be taken to relax export restrictions on commodities such as rice
3730668 104 helicopters almost six times the number desperately needed by peacekeepers in darfur are flying in air shows and sitting in hangars across europe
3730669 the success in supporting african development will not only result in tangible benefits for her people but ensure a more secure and prosperous future for the world for g8 leaders helping africa to help itself is not a question of altruism it is a matter of self interest
3730670 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3730671 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3730672 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3730673 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3730674 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3730675 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3730676 the ceasefire agreement specified that they were meant to go backwards they are clearly going forwards
3730677 i am witnessing a huge column of russian vehicles coming out of gori on the road towards tbilisi there are something like 100 russian lorries support trucks and some armoured personnel carriers in a column that has taken something like 20 minutes to pass me
3730678 gori has been sealed off by russian troops i was able to get about a kilometre from the city until i got to a checkpoint manned by chechen troops who are under orders to stay there and have set up shooting positions
3730679 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3730680 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3730681 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3730682 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3730683 we cannot find anyone how they were evacuated and what happened there is a mystery to us
3730684 georgian forces have begun their pullback toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3730685 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3730686 if saakashvili had not been armed up to the teeth he would never have made such a decision
3730687 georgia should not have intervened in south ossetian capital tskhinvali in such an ill prepared manner this was a grave mistake
3730688 the situation is extremely tense and very complicated what happens next is uncertain i hope that the talks of president saakashvili with his western partners will lead to an end to the conflict
3730689 amendments to the ontario energy efficiency act have established minimum efficiencies in 50 product categories that consume 80 per cent of residential energy consumption and 50 per cent of commercial usage
3730690 but even more encouraging is what is in the pipeline for the future ontario appears to be taking energy efficiency very seriously
3730691 weve made some initial progress but weve got a long way to go
3730692 weve done the easy stuff so were going to have to dig deeper
3730693 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3730694 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3730695 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3730696 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3730697 what they are saying is that ignoring russias interests is going to come at a price and theyve said it in a pretty brutal way
3730698 having recovered economically and to a degree politically and militarily they are in a position to say enough is enough
3730699 talking to ordinary russians there is a real sense of national humiliation
3730700 their sense of self worth was dramatically undermined by the soviet collapse their sense of being part of a major power was stripped away
3730701 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell
3730702 the kremlins message is crystal clear dont tread on me
3730703 mollifying them only strengthens the extremists because they can say look we faced down the west and won

3730707 eyewitnesses said ji entered the police station at around 10 45 a m on august 11 at 12 15 p m he was escorted out of the building and put into a dark colored unmarked buick by several men who appeared to be plainclothes policemen
3730708 petitioners have the right to apply we dont dare to touch them
3730709 it was the right thing to do but it was a difficult decision to make because of the supply deficit that has ensued and that were trying really hard to remedy right now
3730710 we regret the inconvenience this is causing our customers and we are working hard to close the gap in supply
3730711 up until now refinery capacity has barely kept up with demand
3730712 in the last decade we have seen a tremendous growth in population and although capacity has grown slightly
3730713 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3730714 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3730715 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3730716 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3730717 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3730718 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3730719 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3730720 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
3730721 we have now been able to protect the beach so we dont see that happen
3730722 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3730723 were still climbing a mountain you cant just start at the bottom and magically appear on the top were going to keep climbing were always there but its a tough climb
3730724 we have to put our swimmers against the best in the world more and more often
3730725 we have to go around the world with our best group and go against the europeans the americans the australians
3730726 youre talking about budget youre talking about time away from school i think we have to do that were still knocking on the door
3730727 we were in a position to race for that medal
3730728 unfortunately there were a couple of teams that executed a little bit better than we did
3730729 it seemed like lit was going to be easy but we could see nothing is ever really easy
3730730 sometimes you try too hard because you want it so bad we cant be chasing medals weve got to keep fighting when you try too hard you tighten up and you dont get what you want
3730731 it just came down to i didnt go fast enough
3730732 brent came on those guys in the third leg like a freight train he gave me a big boost unfortunately i came up a little bit shy
3730733 it would have been really hard to justify any other way
3730734 we just need a little bit more time a lot of it is going to be experience
3730735 i feel its better than the cfl nfl is real football
3730736 this is cfl country and everyone needs to know it
3730737 im really proud and this is my happiest time in my life to win france the first gold in the olympics all my family and friends are here and i think the gold medal is the best gift for them
3730738 there is no secret our father taught us the value of hard work
3730739 i was so upset not to win china a gold although this is the best result of the men wrestlers in the olympics
3730740 my country is now in a difficult situation and im dedicating this gold to the georgian people who will feel better
3730741 the olympics have been around for a long time its definitely an honour
3730742 its hard to tell who the main competition is its taking faster times to get into semifinals and finals than four years ago
3730743 it might be once in a century when youll see something like this
3730744 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3730745 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3730746 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3730747 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3730748 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3730749 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3730750 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3730751 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3730752 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3730753 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3730754 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3730755 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3730756 das zeigt dass die mehrheit der besch ftigten das ergebnis akzeptiert
3730757 in the final analysis the decision comes down to an application of one of the most important concepts in our law reasonable doubt
3730758 p robable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the police officers knowledge and of which they had reasonable trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed
3730759 it was a joint decision to achieve the most theatrical effects
3730760 i do not think there is anything wrong with that
3730761 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3730762 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3730763 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3730764 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3730765 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3730766 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3730767 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game

3730775 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3730776 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3730777 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3730778 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3730779 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3730780 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3730781 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3730782 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3730783 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3730784 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3730785 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3730786 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3730787 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3730788 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3730789 im a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
3730790 i sat in their room the other night and just watched them
3730791 their cribs are close together and they held each others hands as they fell asleep
3730792 it was so neat to see them comfort one another
3730793 we want to have a nice quiet low key day
3730794 maybe go for a walk in the country visit some friends
3730795 we wanted to make sure everyone that we were close to all the people whove supported us could be there
3730796 so we could say we did it we made it to a year and all of you helped us out
3730797 they couldnt figure out how to blow out the candles so their cousins helped them

3730803 there is no doubt in my mind that major league soccer in portland would both add a tremendous amount to the league and have a phenomenally positive impact on our community and state
3730804 we have the most ardent and authentic soccer fanbase in the united states and soccer city usa deserves a major league soccer team
3730805 in the coming months we look forward to making an exceptionally strong case to both mls and our community as to why portland should be designated as one of the next two mls expansion cities

3730814 byron is an experienced player and adds more depth to our squad as we make our playoff run
3730815 he is a proven goal scorer in this league and we expect him to continue to help produce results like he did in our exhibition match against tigres
3730816 where your friends colleagues and family must do everything within that zone left handed
3730817 portland is a very independently minded city and unique in its support of both soccer and the use of public investment to improve our quality of life
3730818 portlanders will demand a significant role in any effort that impacts either public money or a portland institution like the timbers we want to help the public determine how we would want to bring mls to portland
3730819 even in soccer city usa there are people who just dont like the sport while others may love soccer football or baseball but not like the idea of public investment were considering all sides of the discussion
3730820 were going to try to accommodate any and all types of contest submission whether its a well researched persuasive essay original photo artwork or even a home brew as long as it makes some statement about mls in portland and we can show it on the site for people to vote for it its in the running

3730840 this partnership with civica has already delivered far more than software and services civicas input on the strategic direction of hackney homes has proved invaluable
3730841 the offensive and illegal sign on the three bedroom house in the loyalist donegall road area of south belfast declared this property is not available for any foreigners the donegall road area is home to a substantial number of people from asian communities and other migrant workers there have been a number of attacks on homes occupied by foreign nationals and the landlord behind the sign said a romanian tenant fled last week after the windows were smashed and the bin set on fire outside the front door
3730842 i love green space as much as the next person
3730843 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
3730844 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
3730845 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
3730846 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad
3730847 we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
3730848 we need your help because we have so many red states where we have a once in a generation opportunity
3730849 it would be less than what they are now paying to administer their own health insurance programs because it would be spread over so many
3730850 there is already a deduction that is allowed on the federal tax code which gets carried through the state income tax this would be beyond what is currently allowed
3730851 the department of insurance is currently developing a program that will assist small businesses in pooling together to purchase insurance and get a better premium rate
3730852 only 61 cents of every dollar spent in our schools makes it to the classroom even under a liberal interpretation of what counts
3730853 each 1 percent of improvement would mean over 100 million new dollars to hire more teachers pay them better make class sizes smaller reduce the cost of textbooks and so on thats a huge opportunity and we must seize it
3730854 this is a modest proposal but we want to do whatever we can to support teachers and their commitment to students
3730855 as schools refocus their spending away from overhead and into the classroom we hope eventually to make out of pocket teacher spending unnecessary
3730856 second were really proud of the team we were able to assemble here with a highly skilled work force
3730857 nestl is the kind of company the kind of people we want in the state
3730858 this is a global company and they have a world of choices
3730859 please write your local farm bureau president encouraging him or her to support gov daniels for another four years
3730860 just like most americans its summer time weve got the fair going on and there are a lot of fun and interesting things to do but as they begin to focus i think hell do really well in indiana
3730861 our goal is to get 150 women signed up to be part of this grassroots effort in the next 10 days so that we can have a press conference soon to alert other hoosier women that we are supporting senator mccain for president
3730862 he had a quiet professionalism and a dry sense of humor i never heard him once complain
3730863 i cant tell you how happy i am for you to have had a father like yours
3730864 americans spent 10 times as much on imported oil in the month of june than all the investment in new u s ethanol producing capacity for the entirety of 2007
3730865 oil imports also accounted for 80 percent our 56 8 billion trade deficit for the month
3730866 a disaster declaration from the sba would help northwest indianas communities cleanup and recover from the devastating storms
3730867 i hope it comes quickly so that we can put this difficult time behind us
3730868 ive known mr cox all my life and he jokes with people
3730869 its hard for me to understand how we can censure mr cox for something we dont know he did
3730870 censure seems like were in a hurry to find him guilty
3730871 but with fewer personnel it will go beyond us our citizens will be asked to shoulder some of the burden
3730872 our goal is to educate the public about what we do what we respond to and what were responsible for
3730873 we also want the public to know the ramifications of losing personnel
3730874 it could mean closing a station thats now a real possibility
3730875 the bottom line is we cannot support the level of fire protection or police protection with the current level of funding
3730876 weve been chipping away for four years and its never hit the fire and police personnel next year it will
3730877 the data show we are experiencing a steady growth over all areas and we are becoming a more heterogeneous population
3730878 if im not getting paid no one else is either
3730879 where you go i will go and where you stay i will stay where you die i will die and there i will be buried may the lord deal with me be it ever so severely if anything but death separates you and me
3730880 dont forget him hes coming home soon for you to moon over him
3730881 as far as we can tell and as far looking back this is the first live network evening newscast to originate from here since 1987 the last time nbc nightly news broadcast from here
3730882 one day my mom called my two sisters and me in sat us down on the bed and told us she had been notified that his plane had been shot down and he was missing in action
3730883 over the years i got letters in the mail all the time letting me know anytime the air force had reports from villagers or anything that pertained at all to the plane crash
3730884 i had no expectation that anything like that was coming
3730885 sometimes it takes weeks and other times it takes years
3730886 its nice to know that somethings still being done to try to identify people after all these years
3730887 after all these years its nice to put closure to it
3730888 but at the same time i always had that little glimmer of hope that hed still be alive
3730889 je pensais tre bien dans le combat mais visiblement je ne l tais pas
3730890 j tais fatigu parce que toute la matin e je me suis battu je pensais que la coupure me ferait du bien cela na pas t le cas

3730892 we are in the middle of a serious foreign policy crisis gordon brown is leading with vigour and determination
3730893 i am fully focused on dealing with the situation in georgia
3730894 i am working very closely with gordon on that end of story
3730895 you make all the content they make all the revenue
3730896 oh my god what kind of pathetic monstrosity are we in for
3730897 if two years ago i came there the people shout at me
3730898 i went there to the new villages they are kissing my hand
3730899 its probably pretty hard to imagine forking over almost 200 to have someone massage bird doodoo into your face for the better part of an hour
3730900 hi there maam only 50 to serve fluffy there a gourmet meal of roasted chicken and artichoke hearts
3730901 well hello sir would you like to try our manly man icure we use only 100 crushed bavarian beetle wings and milk from pregnant alsatian yaks all the celebrities are doing it only 100
3730902 were not convinced that a code of ethics will help a lot
3730903 university of california taking then memorabilia of a junkie band and making it into a museum piece
3730904 were looking at the facts now and human ignition is a possibility since most mother nature caused fires get started from lightning and we didnt have any sunday
3730905 i think the reason everyone got out there so fast was because it went from smoke to flames in minutes
3730906 he just ran up there with the shovel and started going to work
3730907 you could quickly find somebody getting hurt if the winds picked up its not real safe
3730908 although the helicopter will be based in minden this opportunity will allow the helicopter to spend significant time in the tahoe basin ready for immediate response
3730909 this is an asset for us that can be used for backcountry rescues and locating missing persons but its main goal is as an immediately available resource to stop wildfire
3730910 after the initial training we will be able to save precious time getting to the area of the fire keeping small fires from turning into disasters
3730911 giving children an education in conservation has been extremely important for addressing the problems in the tahoe basin after all they are the generation that will inherit tahoe
3730912 nobody has bombed the btc pipeline explosion of pipeline worsens humanitarian catastrophe
3730913 of course im going to be nervous im even nervous right now on the first day
3730914 just taking on the whole responsibility of leading the entire team makes you nervous
3730915 heidi clued me in that she was moving to reno and she said i want to pass the program on to you if you want it
3730916 she recommended that i take on the position i thought about it for a while and it worked with my time plus all the seniors this year i used to have on a club team so it was hard to say no to them
3730917 they graeber and kelly both had similar philosophies so theres not much change there there was no hesitation to make the decision
3730918 my plan is to break it all down to fundamentals and really focus on teamwork
3730919 and theres lots of things that go with team work you have to be dedicated you have to develop a unity with your teammates you have to have a positive attitude
3730920 you have to be nervous you can never be too comfortable
3730921 i can teach anyone how to play volleyball but its the other things that i want to be able to do
3730922 this is an opportunity for the public and the apc to give comment on the project and he list of impacts to be studied in the environmental impact statement
3730923 we still have a lot of questions and a lot of things that need to be analyzed in the environmental document
3730924 what kind of a state do we want nevada to be in the future
3730925 when the revenues arent there you only have one course of action reduce spending its what your family does when there isnt as much money to go around we live within our means
3730926 ive made every agency reduction that i could took everything i could out of the rainy day fund postponed every capital improvement project and there are still a lot of people out there who felt we should be raising taxes
3730927 the only way to address this situation though is to reduce spending and increase efficiency
3730928 california will go after people on their income and in turn those people may move their revenue and businesses nevada could be the beneficiary of that
3730929 in a race im always hammering so hard the whole time that its hard to enjoy it
3730930 today the weather was great the water was so refreshing the setting was so beautiful and the group was so awesome i just couldnt have asked for a better day
3730931 im just getting excited to get out on the water and find my rhythm
3730932 im just going to try to pace myself and you know its fun to put yourself through some pain every once in awhile
3730933 we chose stand up paddling for this event because these athletes are always up for trying something new and the learning curve for stand up paddling is really steep
3730934 but introducing what seems like an unbelievable journey becomes very symbolic of someone who is suffering from a brain related injury something that seems really easy on the surface becomes much more difficult
3730935 i was thinking about the vets when i was on the water
3730936 and you know for them its a life changing deal to come back and have a serious brain injury i was just thinking about how hard it must be for them and it was like every stroke youre taking out there on the water is for them
3730937 it felt good to be out there raising awareness for the foundation because what those guys are sacrificing for us goes a long way
3730938 im happy to do this in honor of these guys
3730939 and i guess its kind of like skiing when it gets really cold and you just have to endure to get through it stand up paddling we just had to endure getting tired and just keep pressing on
3730940 skiing is like a quick high its done real fast sometimes its a couple of seconds or two minutes but doing something like this you really have to focus on persevering
3730941 i am proud to have helped found the tahoe summit and the health of lake tahoe and its surrounding areas is hugely important to me
3730942 we have accomplished a lot in the past 11 years but we need to continue work on lake clarity and restoration and implementing the environmental improvement program so we can all enjoy lake tahoe for years to come my thanks to all the parties coming to the table to discuss where we are and where we need to go for the future of the lake
3730943 i was surprised to win actually because ive been coming down here for so long and never won anything
3730944 we really want to thank bank of america for their continuing and generous support of hot august nights
3730945 well since nobody was watching we tuned it at 140 mph on u s highway 395
3730946 its just a group of local car nuts that come out and show their cars at the chateau
3730947 there will be no cost for construction to the district
3730948 the thrust of independent incline is to wipe crystal bay off the face of the map
3730949 im not being facetious or overdramatic the proponents of this thing did not consider changing the name to something other than incline village its an arrogant and extremely offensive act of aggression
3730950 i hope we can continue to maintain and improve the sense of community between incline village and crystal bay
3730951 i see this whole issue as being extremely divisive and my hope is we can join forces and move beyond this division

3730978 this is the first high resolution family based study which examined in a systematic manner whether rare copy number mutations contribute to sporadic schizophrenia
3730979 the affymetrix technology made it possible for us to discover that de novo copy number mutations account for at least 10 percent of the non familial cases of this devastating disease now that we better understand what brain development pathways are involved with schizophrenia we can look at better ways of treating it in the future
3730980 identifying these genetic deletions provides us with rich clues to follow up in future research on schizophrenia
3730981 recent advances in high quality genotyping such as the newest chip technologies from affymetrix enabled us to determine the importance of copy number variations through true genome wide surveys
3730982 the affymetrix snp array 6 0 enables researchers to perform the most powerful whole genome association and copy number studies ever by genotyping more markers across more individuals at a lower cost per sample
3730983 scientists around the world are using this power to discover rare genetic variations associated with complex diseases these three recent schizophrenia discoveries are great examples of research breakthroughs that should bring us closer to a day when we can diagnose treat and potentially cure this debilitating disorder

3731060 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3731061 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3731062 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3731063 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3731064 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3731065 the developed version is a sophisticated shoot and scoot high mobility system the test today wednesday was aimed at improving the system and sub system
3731066 youre starting to annoy people with your fucking little duckie and jug of water

3731074 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
3731075 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
3731076 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
3731077 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
3731078 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
3731079 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
3731080 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series

3731114 the hunt meant so much more than mere utilitarian gain to go hunting was to tap into the continents bounty to exercise your skill with a shotgun perhaps to band together with neighbors after plowing you also expressed your rights or ideals in a fledgling polity hunting was at once ecological economic and political thing to do a social event and a sport
3731115 by 1871 the meanings of pigeon fever centered squarely on money
3731116 pigeons still meant far more than economic gain and the meaningful reasons people convert birds into cash are far more varied and complex
3731117 in the late nineteenth century americansencounters with nature changed as urban populations exploded the economic uses of natural resources increased exponentially and the destruction of game species became a bellwether for our ties to nature in the coming century
3731118 the specific modern constellation of intensive overuses of nature urban long distance connections and strangely unmoored meanings
3731119 ties to nature were transformative and multifaceted at once economic aesthetic utilitarian imaginative
3731120 americans rapid conversion of a landscape of abundance into one of scarcity
3731121 for many americans the flocks were becoming icons of the past in a time of rapid change the vanishing pigeons carried echoes of bygone times shooting pigeons and making pigeon pies had been in part an understanding of a certain rural world and one time pigeon hunters now understood the loss of the flocks as the loss of that larger experience
3731122 to use natural resources more sustainably first you have to recognize you are using them
3731123 flocks were becoming icons of the past in a time of rapid change

3731126 the widespread expression of social values in environmental action that marks off the environmental era from the conservation years
3731127 that are well charted by the innumerable citizen organizations and studies of public attitudes
3731128 only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one species man acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world
3731129 along with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of mans total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends

3731156 it was the excitement as captain it is a huge responsibility and there was a lot of work to do
3731157 we were afraid that we might not be able to cater for the crowds we had no money we had a nine hole course then it was basic stuff like getting the curtains and the floor cleaned and polished we had one full time green keeper by the name of martin donegan and he is still with us we also had two part time green keepers we couldnt afford anything else
3731158 laytown and bettystown were very kind to us for the first leg when we wanted to practice so we returned the compliment when they arrived down but on the day of the final we made sure we didnt set the pins it was a bit unfair maybe they could practice on the course but the pins were set just before the off it was a slight advantage for us
3731159 they made a tactical error by coming down the night before they stayed in germaines and unfortunately for them there was a wedding on the premises they were up half the night with the music and the craic they told us the next day
3731160 we went to laytown first and we lost 3 2 up there which meant that we had to win four at home to win outright if we only won by the same score line then we would have had to pick two players for a sudden death play off
3731161 we had an early meeting and played a few holes we had the team picked two days earlier and we were well prepared we changed the placings around from the first leg we needed a little freshness
3731162 vincent mccormack and brian kilcoyne went out first and they won 2 and 1
3731163 maurice furlong and david lord pulled away for a 5 and 4 win which gave us a bit of a lift
3731164 it was down to ger kilcoyne and raymond danne on the 16th we were one down we won the 17th the tension was unbearable and the pressure was on the two lads rocky raymond hit a marvelous drive which meant that laytown were hitting in their second shots first they hit long above the green which was a mistake because they now had a downhill put which was lightning fast ger kilcoyne punched in an eight iron to about three feet below the hole

3731169 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3731174 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3731175 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls

3731216 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3731217 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3731218 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease
3731219 the media has the power to increase awareness and inform people about lung cancer and in doing so become an informed voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years

3731260 its too bad because that pin will probably end up in a drawer somewhere in a few weeks ill probably never see another one like it
3731261 it takes a lot of perseverance and youve got to have a lot of patience the perfect pin isnt always immediately available sometimes itll be several days before you track it down if you ever do
3731262 a lot of the times youll see a pin and if you really want it you have to do your best to get it because you may not see it again
3731263 we went to the l a olympics in 1984 and were given a handful of pins by the sponsor that invited us and we started trading them with other people and we got hooked on it and have been to seven of the olympic games

3731277 several people mentioned that my next opponent should be bj penn nothing is obviously signed yet but fighting him is my number one goal i think he deserves a chance to challenge for my belt but well see what happens in the coming weeks i hope deeply that my next fight is in montreal the president of the ufc dana white said he would like to return to montreal before the end of the year for my part i do not know if i will go back in the octagon before 2009 i had four fights in the past 12 months so i need rest i like my life but sometimes i have to relax i make so many sacrifices for me prepare during training camps i can hardly live therefore i need to refuel psychologically
3731278 apart from being an excellent restaurant its a brave one

3731282 hes created a genuine neighborhood restaurant this doesnt necessarily mean the food is modest the saut ed skate is elegant a golden fan that conceals perfectly lovaged potatoes theres no better canvas for fresh herbs than a blank chicken and the roast chicken at james is a minor masterpiece
3731283 most of the food at hundred acres is reasonably priced solidly prepared and sometimes even pleasing in an unobtrusive neighborly sort of way forge is yet another new big city restaurant painstakingly designed to look like the inside of a barn none of the pastas quite achieve liftoff but the fish dishes are capably made

3731300 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3731301 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3731327 the state has seen a gain of only 18 000 massachusetts residents with incomes above 300 of the poverty level in the commonwealth choice plan thats because it costs 7 000 12 000 a year for a family of four to buy the baseline health plan that includes a 2 000 single 4 000 family deductible before most benefits are available a family of four with an income of at least 61 000 300 of the federal poverty level would not qualify for a subsidy
3731328 the insurance adjusted poverty rate for adults aged 25 64 in 2000 was 10 5 percent on that basis health insurance is unaffordable for 10 5 percent of adults aged 25 64 for the whole sample using the poverty line as a benchmark 71 percent of the currently uninsured population could afford health insurance coverage using the threshold that 80 percent of similar households purchase insurance they find that around 25 percent of the uninsured could afford coverage based on peer comparisons
3731329 depending on the parameters chosen in our definition we find that health insurance was affordable to between 24 and 55 of the uninsured in 1998
3731330 affordability of health insurance measured in various ways is not a particularly accurate predictor of whether a person will obtain coverage it is certainly not the only explanation of observed patterns of insurance coverage

3731339 a study by two economists that argues that drilling in anwr would produce an immediate drop in oil prices even if the oil did not enter refineries for several years interestingly this study was the energy journal not because they disagreed with the findings but because they considered the studys conclusion so obvious that it was not worth publishing
3731340 the bush administration wants americans to believe that drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coastlines will ease our pain at the gas pump in reality it would lower gas prices by mere pennies and that would be 20 years from now
3731341 the arctic national wildlife refuge with its varied and sensitive ecosystems should be preserved that pristine area must remain off limits
3731342 in short there could be much more oil under the sea than previously known
3731343 with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense
3731344 between 1993 and 2007 there were 651 spills of all sizes at ocs facilities in federal waters three miles or more offshore that released 47 800 barrels of oil with 7 5 billion barrels of oil produced in that time that equates to 1 barrel of oil spilled per 156 900 barrels produced thats not to minimize the danger but no form of energy is perfect or without trade offs besides if it is acceptable to drill in the caspian sea and in developing countries such as nigeria where environmental concerns are equally important its hard to explain why the united states should rule out drilling off its own coasts

3731350 so a lot of times i find its a very good strategy to at least connect with the other person and tell them why we are coming on at a certain price because one of the things you dont want is a price lowering feud where people are angry with each other and making barbs about the other property

3731416 if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels
3731417 i dont think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium 3
3731418 but over the long term we do face an energy problem
3731419 this reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering
3731420 helium 3 is present on the moon but in very small concentration levels meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium 3
3731421 our real challenge is not obtaining the helium 3 it is demonstrating that we can burn it

3731461 thanks to previous funding from sshrc we know there is about a 1 200 year gap in history where the people living in this region just seemed to disappear

3731626 there is in crete a city called o xos in which one etearchos became king who when he had a daughter whose mother was dead named phronime took to wife another woman notwithstanding she having come in afterwards thought fit to be a stepmother to phronime in deed as well as in name giving her evil treatment and devising everything possible to her hurt and at last she brings against her a charge of lewdness and persuades her husband that the truth is so he then being convinced by his wife devised an unholy deed against the daughter for there was in o xos one themison a merchant of thera whom etearchos took to himself as a guest friend and caused him to swear that he would surely serve him in whatsoever he should require and when he had caused him to swear this he brought and delivered to him his daughter and bade him take her away and cast her into the sea themison then was very greatly vexed at the deceit practised in the matter of the oath and he dissolved his guest friendship and did as follows that is to say he received the girl and sailed away and when he got out into the open sea to free himself from blame as regards the oath which etearchos had made him swear he tied her on each side with ropes and let her down into the sea and then drew her up and came to thera after that polymnestos a man of repute among the theraians received phronime from him and kept her as his concubine and in course of time there was born to him from her a son with an impediment in his voice and lisping to whom as both theraians and kyrenians say was given the name battos but i think that some other name was then given and he was named battos instead of this after he came to libya taking for himself this surname from the oracle which was given to him at delphi and from the rank which he had obtained for the libyans call a king battos and for this reason i think the pythian prophetess in her prophesying called him so using the libyan tongue because she knew that he would be a king in libya

3731664 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3731665 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3731666 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3731667 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3731668 subsequent statements have been a reflection of events on the ground
3731669 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3731670 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3731671 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3731672 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3731673 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3731674 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3731675 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3731676 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3731677 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3731678 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3731679 it is difficult to say we are optimistic but we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
3731680 you muslims prepare for war and raise the banner of jihad let us shed our blood let our limbs be dismembered until we regain the wise caliphate rule
3731681 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3731682 to instruct forces to urgently overcome the consequences helping people stabilise life and keep updating damages
3731683 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3731684 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3731685 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3731686 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3731687 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3731688 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3731689 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks
3731690 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
3731691 sie haben eine mannschaft mit mehr potenzial vorne sind sie gef hrlich sie haben einen neuen trainer sie haben viel geld aber wir m ssen eine runde weiter
3731692 yet he wrote to me a kind email in which he remarked on how my attempt to live environmentally during the no impact experiment ended with my discovering the shortcomings of materialism as a way of life and the strengths of living with contentment gratitude relationships and love
3731693 he said it would be selfish because it wasnt something his family could enjoy with him
3731694 he knew the dangers and he knew what he was doing was important
3731695 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3731696 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3731697 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3731698 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
3731699 when one pixel covers a large area in a 3d video game landscapewhat color should that pixel be it can only be one color but the area it covers may contain many different colors

3731718 it is important to ask about suicidal thoughts regularly especially when disease is worsening symptoms are increasing or the patient is entering a more serious phase of illness creating an environment where these issues can be openly explored without being judged is critical

3731744 we either layoff folks in the street department to compensate or we raise taxes and im not about to raise anybodys taxes
3731745 i dont feel like the citys unsafe but we need our officers and the more we have the better off we are
3731746 it was five nerve wracking days before an email from lu said that although the works had suffered some damage he his family the workers and stan were ok
3731747 i had imagined stanley standing scratching his head up to his neck in rubble saying thats another fine mess you got me into olley
3731748 but the chinese are remarkably unshakable and determined after three weeks the statue was on the dock side at shanghai awaiting shipment
3731749 landlords should be vigilant and alert to the fact that this is going on in some rented houses i dont want to panic people unnecessarily but in light of the recent happenings and the fact that this is the third occasion in the castlerea area i would appeal to landlords to be vigilant these people seem to target more rural isolated areas where they may not be noticed to any great degree
3731750 if a landlord is not satisfied with the bone fidas of the person renting the property of if they notice anything unusual or out of the ordinary they should contact the gardai and we will take the necessary action
3731751 some landlords live away from an area and do not see their properties and as long as the rent is being paid on time they think everything is all right
3731752 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3731753 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so
3731754 specific effects of caring for a spouse with dementia differences in depressive symptoms between caregiver and non caregiver spouses
3731755 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3731756 look at them they have the little bitty baby teeth
3731757 its as big a problem as doping it is more blatant cheating than doping its a slap in the face to the whole world shame on them but theres nothing you can do about it
3731758 the only thing they can do is abolish the age limit
3731759 one of the employees told me i cant do any bigger or better in my world thats a challenge
3731760 it started blowing people away and the managers there asked me to keep doing it
3731761 it wasnt a huge departure from what i had been doing and i love it
3731762 its like they are just in the back of my imagination
3731763 im thrilled for him that the city is honoring all of his artwork its quite impressive to see all of his pieces together
3731764 its all very exciting i never expected all this would happen
3731765 if we enter the game thinking it will be a nice 90 minutes for us playing at our leisure then we will become unstuck
3731766 i thought they would send me out on loan but i settled in really well
3731767 i think there was a thin line between all these candidates but i think dr edwards was personable he is experienced in getting parents non traditional parents who are not normally involved getting those parents bringing them to the table and one of our greatest challenges in this district is getting parents to come in and be active in the education of their children
3731768 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3731769 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3731770 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3731771 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3731772 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3731773 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3731774 the sample for this study was a low income population
3731775 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3731776 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3731777 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3731778 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
3731779 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
3731780 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3731781 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3731782 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3731783 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3731784 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3731785 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3731786 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3731787 i was a little frisky and thought id get a little spiced up make sure im clean for the show know what im saying

3731790 especially for todays multimedia data services it is incredibly important that operators discern how users actually experience their services rather than simply understanding how the network behaves
3731791 our partnership with ibm as well as the overall concept of oss probe integration is an early example of how the emerging area of customer experience management might be effectively addressed from a monitoring and troubleshooting perspective
3731792 in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 most likely
3731793 thats kind of what i train my mind to do to run a 9 6
3731794 ive never had so many people want to take my picture or tell me you can do it
3731795 its crazy that motivates me as well because i dont want to let people down
3731796 i was feeling a little bit of panic because of the injury
3731797 it really hurt when it happened when it first kind of pulled when i was on the ground it kind of eased up a little bit it could have been adrenaline or whatever
3731798 the same thing happened to me in 2004 when i was in college it started playing with my mind and messing with me a little bit that kind of got my confidence a little bit
3731799 i went to germany to see dr hans wilhelm muller wohlfarth a famous doctor and he works with a lot of soccer stars and football stars and other great athletes
3731800 he has a lot of experience with hamstring injuries and that is why i went there i basically saw a great massage therapist and did some great rehab i had access to a weight room and anything that i needed so this was the best option for me
3731801 i dont feel any aches or any twitching or anything like that
3731802 ive been staying hydrated and treating my body very well so im really confident that its gonna hold up
3731803 i dont really mind if people say i am the favorite or i am the underdog because it is all about just handling the pressure
3731804 i think this is one of the hottest 100 meter dashes in history asafa powell is looking good right now usain bolt is looking great as well

3731818 i havent been on the track since usas but ive had some good practices and i feel that if everything goes well it could be a real fast time i think in the finals well show that right now there hasnt been this much hype around one event in a long time with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible
3731819 a lot of times people call out more than whats really there
3731820 the enemy may place something on the road just to confuse you when they are planning to use some other force

3731846 gis datasets are growing increasingly complex often involving many gigabytes of interactive maps we are under pressure to deliver products capable of crunching through these datasets fast efficiently and accurately
3731847 with the cuda configuration calculations that previously took 20 minutes to complete are now done in 30 seconds moreover calculations that previously took 30 to 40 seconds are now real time it is no exaggeration to say that at least for our industry nvidia cuda technology could be the most revolutionary development in computing since the invention of the microprocessor
3731848 manifold is the first gis to exploit massively parallel supercomputer technology on a desktop using inexpensive plug in cards that provide hundreds of processors for less than 500 that enables gis tasks and analysis to be completed hundreds of times faster than before through an innovative use of inexpensive consumer hardware
3731849 the latest figures coming so soon after the appalling live register statistics confirm our worst fears with the jobs market nose diving and 132 people losing their jobs on a daily basis all the evidence suggests that things are going to get worse with many businesses reducing employee hours and numbers at unprecedented levels
3731850 the service facilitated over one hundred elderly people many of whom live on their own with no transport whatsoever and they now have to rely on friends and neighbours or hire taxis to get to the towns for the essential needs and all because the government will not provide the 6 200 shortfall in the budget to enable to continue the end of the year
3731851 the cut in this service upon which elderly people in these areas so badly depend is a huge set back

3731869 dear joe i read the comment recently that one of your readers sent in about reporting children not in safety seats attached with this email is a picture taken from my car earlier today at the end of route 376 in berlin next to bucks place if you can see it is a motorcycle with two children on the back i would guess the two girls were around 7 years old now when riding in a car we are expected to have our children buckled up in properly installed safety seats not only was there one child that in a car would most likely have to be in a seat but two children both girls did have helmets on but as i got closer when stopping at the stop sign i could tell they were only bike cycle helmets i had followed this motorcycle for several miles and observed the girls a few times they lifted their arms out as if they were flying and the girl in the very back seemed to lose balance and had to grab on to the back of the seat i did call the worcester county sheriffs office at 410 632 1111 adn the nice lady who answered the phone did tell me that riding a child on the back of a motorcycle was legal as long as they had a helmet on she did not know if it was legal to have two children and said she would patch me through to dispactch well i waited on hold and before they could come on to answer the question i pulled up at work and to hang up do you have an in at the worcester county sheriffs office and can find out the answer plus if you do the license plate number was maryland 012m33 as a mother of a 6 year old and 9 month old i find it absolutely crazy that a parent would do this i also cant believe that maryland law permits a child that should be in a safety seat to ride on the back of a motorcyle i know this may offend some motorcycle riders out there but im only thinking of the safety of those two children i dont believe children should be on motorcycles if they would have to be in a safety se at in a vehicle maryann berlin md

3731899 in this age of 4 a gallon gas we felt that vudu customers deserved a break and should be able to watch a great film for just 99 cents

3731903 she trained for the descent not the climb because that was going to be her weakness
3731904 it was a rolling course and emma was eighth so we said you know what the olympic course is much more mountainous so if we really focus on this how much more progress could we make
3731905 we pulled together a group of specialists coaches psychologists bike experts into a kind of commando unit we called it project pooley
3731906 we developed a completely different bike that allowed her to make use of her very small size which is fantastic for going up hills but not much good for coming down when it is about power
3731907 the problem was there was not a lot of proprietary equipment out there on the mainstream market that was small enough
3731908 so we developed something special for her that allows her to get into that really tucked position coming down because her advantage is that being small she doesnt hit a lot of air
3731909 she did brilliantly as she took time out of most of the big names in cycling on the descent which is incredible everyone except armstrong who got the gold
3731910 ones natural reaction is to back off the pedals as soon as the road starts sloping down
3731911 but like anything else it is trainable to reduce that what she would have been trying to achieve is exactly the same power uphill as down the only thing that changes is the speed

3731953 we believe the fund has no choice at this time but to review all of its strategic alternatives to improve its outlook going forward
3731954 these options include in no specific order a sale of its engineered systems division issuing stock in a private placement or converting back to a corporate structure ahead of the income trust deadline without the obligation to renew the dividend in the future in our view all of these initiatives would increase the funds capability to reduce leverage and give it increased operational flexibility

3731977 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3731978 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3731979 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors

3732042 we will now leave them to run the council if they fail it will be them who have failed
3732043 those found to have participated should quit to enable independent investigations and a censure by parliament
3732044 the proper position is that an order of the court such as the one made on june 12 2008 is to be respected by all including public officers this is why the order covers the defendant and their agents servants or whosoever
3732045 as i have stated an order of the court must be respected by all and the claim by the minister that the injunction does not apply to her is a misconception
3732046 it appears the minister on seeing that the defendant failed to move the plaintiffs from the trading area following the order made by the court decided to use her ministerial powers to take the very action which the court had restrained the council its agents servants or whosoever not to take
3732047 this is unacceptable and amounts to interfering with court proceedings and shows a willful disregard of the court injunction
3732048 i do not believe that the state proceedings act was meant to protect public officers who decide to willfully disobey or disregard court orders the minister should have allowed the law to take its course she knew that the matter was in court hence the reason why she should have exercised restraint and caution in the manner in which she involved herself
3732049 i grant the application by the plaintiffs and i grant leave to the plaintiffs to apply for committal proceedings against hon sylvia masebo costs to the plaintiffs to be taxed in default of agreement

3732054 in cape town we focused on specific areas like the inner city where we wanted to get rid of crime and grime here we brought crime down by 60
3732055 a body set up to fight copper theft called the copperheads has also brought copper theft down from r22m to r500000
3732056 in hout bay which used to be wracked with crime the neighbourhood watch has brought crime down by 80 and in bergvliet and meadowridge crime has been reduced by 60
3732057 specialised units have previously been hugely successful in combating specific crimes almost all have been closed down they must be reinstated so that the war on child abuse narcotics and vehicle theft among others can be strengthened
3732058 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it

3732069 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3732070 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3732071 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3732072 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3732073 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3732074 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3732075 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3732076 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3732077 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3732078 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3732079 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3732080 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3732081 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3732082 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3732083 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3732084 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3732085 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3732086 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3732087 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3732088 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3732089 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3732090 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3732091 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3732092 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3732093 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3732094 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3732095 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3732096 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3732097 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3732098 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3732099 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3732100 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3732101 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3732102 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3732103 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3732104 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3732105 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3732106 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3732107 the hospital management offers its public apology to the victims and their families following what happened
3732108 of course there are special procedures when dealing with psychiatric patients
3732109 these patients are often regarded as discarded people or vagrants
3732110 on the brink of precipice a human rights account of kenyas post 2007 election violence
3732111 during the course of the fighting we would see vehicles land cruisers carrying food and water to our opponents
3732112 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3732113 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3732114 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3732115 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3732116 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3732117 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3732118 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3732119 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3732120 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3732121 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3732122 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3732123 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3732124 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3732125 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat the same dire changes will affect the rest of the world and i can envisage americans migrating into canada and the chinese into siberia but there may be little food for any of them
3732126 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3732127 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3732128 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this

3732141 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
3732142 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
3732143 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
3732144 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3732145 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3732146 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3732147 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3732148 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3732149 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3732150 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3732151 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3732152 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3732153 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3732154 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3732155 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3732156 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3732157 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3732158 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3732159 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3732160 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3732161 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3732162 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3732163 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3732164 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3732165 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3732166 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3732167 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3732168 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3732169 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3732170 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3732171 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3732172 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3732173 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3732174 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3732175 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3732176 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3732177 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3732178 just so you all know we did set a record
3732179 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3732180 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3732181 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3732182 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3732183 il provvedimento di ryanair minaccia di colpire in italia migliaia di passeggeri spiega il codacons che rischiano di vedere rovinate le proprie vacanze si tratterebbe di un comportamento ai danni dei consumatori non solo scorretto ma senza ombra di dubbio illegale
3732184 lintenzione di non confermare questi biglietti notizia che ha creato un indiscutibile stato di allarme tra i numerosissimi turisti coinvolti prosegue il codacons stata giustificata dalla compagnia come il tentativo di mettere fine alla guerra contro chi non rispetta le tariffe
3732185 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3732186 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3732187 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3732188 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3732189 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3732190 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3732191 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3732192 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3732193 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3732194 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3732195 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3732196 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3732197 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3732198 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3732199 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3732200 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3732201 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3732202 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3732203 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3732204 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3732205 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3732206 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3732207 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3732208 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3732209 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
3732210 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
3732211 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
3732212 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
3732213 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
3732214 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3732215 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3732216 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3732217 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3732218 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3732219 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3732220 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3732221 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3732222 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3732223 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

3732278 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3732279 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial

3732287 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3732288 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3732289 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

3732294 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3732295 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3732296 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3732297 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3732298 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3732299 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3732300 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3732301 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3732302 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3732303 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3732304 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3732305 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3732306 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3732307 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3732308 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3732309 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3732310 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3732311 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3732312 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3732313 junto a las angustias relacionadas con las incertidumbres que la humanidad vive en este momento

3732316 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3732317 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3732318 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3732319 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3732320 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3732321 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3732322 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3732323 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3732324 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3732325 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3732326 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3732327 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3732328 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3732329 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3732330 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3732331 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3732332 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3732333 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3732334 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3732335 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3732336 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3732337 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3732338 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3732339 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3732340 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3732341 until justice is blind to color until education is unaware of race until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of mens skins emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact

3732346 everyone told me i was nuts when i decided to focus on parkdale
3732347 but i came from the theatre i came from that environment and i loved the architecture
3732348 be sure to spend some time on the streets and in the coffee shops to see the tenor and attitude of the neighbourhood
3732349 a client told me that friends who bought in leslieville were disappointed to find that some parents wouldnt lobby to improve the local school
3732350 back then investors were buying to flip with quick renos that were terrible
3732351 the key difference now is that people are buying in parkdale to live there
3732352 it means that people want to live in an area but the houses are not the right size so developers and home owners are prepared to buy a piece of property and demolish it to build something that really fits their needs
3732353 its going to take time to weed out those dollar stores
3732354 at first i found myself driving to far flung box malls just to get out and it only made me batty it wasnt something id normally do
3732355 as well not being walkable or really accessible by transit even if other people call these areas emerging im a little reluctant
3732356 do you really want to live there and have it be your home if so jump in
3732357 but if you are only buying because you think the area is going to emerge its not a good enough reason if the market slows down and you have to stay are you going to be happy
3732358 since 2003 the pair has produced a series of award winning investigative stories about how cyber crime works and why the problem continues to worsen
3732359 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3732360 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3732361 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3732362 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3732363 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3732364 these are all small things and they all add up
3732365 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3732366 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3732367 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3732368 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3732369 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3732370 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3732371 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3732372 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3732373 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3732374 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3732375 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3732376 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3732377 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3732378 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3732379 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3732380 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3732381 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3732382 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3732383 congresswoman betty mccollum d mn will spend the fourth of july holiday visiting the north african cemetery and memorial in tunisia to pay tribute to american troops including 138 minnesotans who lost their lives in world war ii
3732384 it is an honor for me to have the opportunity to pay tribute to these courageous men on behalf of minnesotans and the nation
3732385 the foreign minister briefed his guest about the comprehensive development work carried out in tunisia under the impulse of president zine el abidine ben ali and stressed tunisias will to further reinforce its relations with the united states highlighting the role of the tunisia caucus in strengthening these relations
3732386 the meeting allowed as well to highlight the role of the tunisia caucus a group within the u s house of representatives including congressmen who want to learn more about tunisia its culture traditions history and people and to further strengthen bilateral relations
3732387 he voiced his readiness to exert more influence to better publicize the opportunities offered by tunisia so as to hoist bilateral co operation to higher levels
3732388 so di essere un po fuori dal coro e forse dal galateo politico ma non condivido anzi contesto la presidenza amato alla commissione del sindaco alemanno
3732389 in questoperazione non c niente di istituzionale e c molto di politico
3732390 un modernizzatore non mette in lista il capo della rivolta dei taxi contro le liberalizzazioni
3732391 stato presidente del consiglio e fino a pochi mesi fa ministro dellinterno di un governo il cui vicepremier era rutelli lavversario di alemanno ed anche sulla sicurezza che abbiamo perso a roma
3732392 noto replica la lanzillotta che le nostre scelte sono assolutamente autonome ci detto mi pare che la sua nomina sia stata fatta da zingaretti limitatamente ai profili istituzionali
3732393 alemanno sar il sindaco di tutti e non di una ristretta oligarchia di potere alla quale persino la lanzilotta aveva aderito con i suoi alleati della sinistra quando esercitava le funzioni di assessore al bilancio ai tempi di rutelli
3732394 liniziativa del sindaco di roma alemanno di affidare ad una commissione il compito di tracciare un progetto per la capitale motivata dal realismo e non dal vizio antico del trasformismo politico alemanno diversamente dai suoi predecessori non possiede una concezione proprietaria della citt ma come ha dichiarato nel suo discorso di insediamento vuole promuovere momenti di forte partecipazione con i mondi vitali della societ romana le sue categorie professionali le associazioni e il volontariato limpresa e le forze sociali
3732395 quella amato stata presentata come una commissione di personalit indipendenti finalizzata a ridisegnare il futuro di roma se cos perch no
3732396 forse la politica dovrebbe essere meno autoreferenziale e narcisista ed occuparsi pi dei problemi veri che investono la vita quotidiana dei cittadini
3732397 i risultati a dire se una cosa vera e utile o se solo un maquillage saranno i fatti a dirci se amato abbia fatto bene o male a presiedere la commissione
3732398 as both parties gear up for the election this is a perfect opportunity for them to articulate their space policies
3732399 both candidates have been making statements regarding space policy lately and were hoping this debate will help clarify their respective plans and what they hope to accomplish
3732400 vanderbilt in so many ways is already a great place for undergraduates and the commons is the answer to the question of how do we improve on a proven recipe for success our graduates accomplish amazing things and our faculty are top researchers and excellent teachers however we wanted to challenge ourselves to define a new model of residential education for the 21st century one that educates the whole student
3732401 we might have a major speaker come to campus and have dinner with students at the deans residence or invite distinguished physicians from our medical center over to an apartment to chat informally about how they became doctors and we definitely will watch vanderbilt sports teams on tv at my house
3732402 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3732403 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3732404 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3732405 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3732406 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion
3732407 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3732408 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3732409 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3732410 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3732411 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3732412 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3732413 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3732414 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3732415 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3732416 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3732417 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3732418 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3732419 whatever happens in a free market is good by definition
3732420 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3732421 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3732422 a bot is like a worm on a leash the bot master can walk the worm to wherever he wants it to go and then he can stop it and let it off the leash and tell it to do whatever he wants it to do
3732423 le multinazionali stanno sperimentando con la natura e con lumanit in un modo che andato terribilmente storto per quale altro motivo stiamo affrontando tutte queste sfide come il cambiamento climatico e il resto
3732424 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3732425 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3732426 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3732427 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth

3732429 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year
3732430 drivers will slow down to look at anything something as simple as a couch dumped in a roadside ditch can send minor shudders of curiosity through the traffic flow traffic is jammed with these

3732432 what carr excels at where his gifts as a journalist shine is explaining how an addicts life works the economics of it the ad hoc social web the quotidian feel of the thing its an essay in urban typology worthy of balzac at his keenest and least windy
3732433 ehrenreich is at her best and shes very very good when chronicling the outrageous human downside of our economy the costs it imposes on people who cant afford a bacon infused old fashioned
3732434 the voices ebershoff has brought to life here dramatize one of the most remarkable periods of americas religious history and hes just as discerning about the bizarre descendants that can sprout like toxic weeds from a founders revelation
3732435 traffic gets about as close to the heart of modern existence as any book could get yet habits of empire by walter nugent
3732436 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3732437 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3732438 the multi ethnic church is becoming the normal and natural picture of the new face of christianity
3732439 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3732440 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3732441 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3732442 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3732443 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3732444 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3732445 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3732446 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3732447 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3732448 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3732449 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3732450 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3732451 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3732452 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3732453 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3732454 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3732455 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3732456 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3732457 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3732458 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3732459 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3732460 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3732461 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3732462 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3732463 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3732464 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3732465 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3732466 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3732467 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3732468 if you dont stop fighting if you capture the country you will not find your brothers and your families because they will all have been massacred
3732469 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of

3732475 hes had 10 or 11 stitches so were hoping for owens sake he can clear that up
3732476 we are expecting good things from him this season so hopefully he will make a quick recovery
3732477 i think its his first goal for about four years and it wasnt a bad strike from about 35 yards
3732478 it was an absolute peach and it was well deserved as i thought he had a great game
3732479 youre always looking to get your first positive result and i thought overall given the amount of effort we put in we probably deserved a point
3732480 its a hell of a long trip and youve got a partisan 1000 plus crowd so its not the easiest place to come to get a result
3732481 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3732482 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3732483 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3732484 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3732485 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3732486 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3732487 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3732488 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3732489 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3732490 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3732491 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3732492 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3732493 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3732494 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3732495 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3732699 that policy developed before text messaging protections such as spam filters adequately protected customers from unwanted messages was designed to ward against communications such as anonymous hate messaging and adult materials sent to children
3732700 caffeine stimulates your nervous system signaling the body to release a small amount of energy from its fat stores
3732701 but stirring in milk cream or sugar can cause your insulin levels to rise which diminishes that metabolic effect
3732702 youre also at risk on the hospitals pediatric floors because of the challenges of caring for children
3732703 we know people are more likely to make mistakes when theyre multitasking distracted and tired
3732704 the single highest risk time is when theres a transition in care because so many little pieces of information can get lost in translation
3732705 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3732706 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3732707 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3732708 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3732709 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3732710 makes you wonder how much you can solve with a good cake

3732714 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3732715 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3732716 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3732717 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3732718 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3732719 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3732720 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3732721 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3732722 although its more like a one two three four punch
3732723 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim

3732727 republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3732728 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3732729 being seen as in the pockets of big oil is not where you want to be as a candidate
3732730 i do believe that its a seismic event in congress
3732731 and everyone in washington has taken notice it certainly could be a harbinger of things to come
3732732 while east tennesseans have been struggling with out of control gas prices
3732733 david davis has pocketed thousands from oil companies why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
3732734 you would think that in a republican primary attacking your opponent as a fan of big business would not work
3732735 but the proof as they say is in the pudding
3732736 it was a way to cue people into the differences between the candidates over influence and money
3732737 to say the election was a referendum on big oil i would say is a stretch
3732738 the republicans are vulnerable to the charge that this move will enrich the oil companies but have no discernible impact on prices
3732739 but in the end i think the republicans will win this one obama has already softened his stance on the issue and many democrats in congress will go along i think we are in store for more drilling no matter what happens
3732740 je savais ce matin quil faudrait nager vite quil ny aurait pas de place pour les calculs

3732744 in your book you mention that your family is involved in an open adoption are you ever fearful that your son will like his birth family better than you and want to go live with them
3732745 my sons 16 of course hed rather go live with his birth mom than with my husband and me
3732746 among the hundreds of comments posted on the whispers site were those comparing it to a gang gesture a nazi salute or worse this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader wrote jake of tennessee
3732747 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama its a symbol of unity hope solidarity and an end to the divisiveness that has plagued this country for too long it is the peace sign of our generation a sign for those who are tired of the fear the hatred the greed and the ignorance there will be resistance democracy requires it but we believe that the good in the american people will persevere

3732750 a financially troubled franchise in chicago is a lot more detrimental to baseball than a bad franchise in kansas city
3732751 the league knows that tribune has enormous amounts of debt and it wants to do things to maximize returns theres going to be some conflict here i dont know how it plays out
3732752 when you set up a structure like that its costly
3732753 the more debt you put on it the more expensive it is the more leverage the more scrutiny you get from baseball
3732754 i dont know if the irs has a basis to challenge it
3732755 were going to be caught in that price squeeze again
3732756 we either have to increase yields or increase the price and we dont have power over either one of those things
3732757 you should be expecting to see higher prices in 2009 on the grocery shelves but the good news is it might not be as severe because the weather has been so good
3732758 i think they are telling investors that in the long term the days of 2 a bushel corn are behind us
3732759 if the harvest turns out to be what the usda predicted the government will have dodged a bullet
3732760 what people do now affects their lives forever and what they do affects us so we want to make sure thats done in the right way
3732761 every time you twitter instead of blogging something interesting you are risking to lose visitors and backlinks
3732762 in order to have a fan base per se of followers in twitter you must be able to keep their interest in you and what you are doing now
3732763 in the same way we have been able to attract and retain florida businesses in other entertainment sectors
3732764 i believe we can do the same for the music industry

3732769 the drop from 1 5701 is in 5 waves and is most likely wave 3 within a 5 wave drop from 1 6039 a corrective 4th wave advance is expected to unfold over the next several days 4th wave usually reach at least the 4th wave of one less degree 1 5083 in this case the 38 2 of 3 is also a common terminal point for 4th waves 1 5153 in this case
3732770 bigger picture we maintain that wave y the third wave in a 3 wave advance from 95 72 is underway from 103 76 and will end in the 113 25 116 65 zone fibo levels from the 124 13 95 72 drop and give way to a long term reversal the rally from 103 76 is probably the first zigzag in a double zigzag as wave y so expectations are for a drop to reach the 38 2 of 103 76 110 40 107 86
3732771 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of the ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3732772 the democratic platform persists in its unapologetic promotion of abortion which kills unborn children and harms all those involved affirming the good of childbirth and adoption does not justify or in any way soften the partys official support for an intrinsic evil
3732773 its been our view as democrats that women should make their decisions based on their moral values

3732776 people who are from chicago have all these amazing warm feeling and memories of chicago it is tribal john is in bangkok making a movie and he was kind of emotional with this ode to chicago
3732777 i dont know that any other city would get that kind of response and resonance
3732778 im always surprised which is part of the fun of what we do but there will be a ton of news and politics writers there will be food because its one of the great food cities in the country and certainly sports we have a bunch of environmental writers because chicago wants to be a leader in growing its green economy
3732779 there is simply no escaping the fact that the recent jet fuel price decline now topping 1 per gallon from junes peak represents the single most rapid and significant annualized savings the industry has ever realized topping 13 billion at current levels
3732780 see you when you get there do what you gonna do
3732781 our tasking today was to come out and focus mainly on the air conditioning units here at the school friday august 01 2008
3732782 it really boggles my mind that were focusing on august 12 that school starts and ends on time i dont know if thats a magic formula to consider at this point
3732783 talk to the restaurant manager right on the spot and make a stink then

3732787 they have destroyed buildings there has been looting by russian troops they were shooting people
3732788 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3732789 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3732790 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3732791 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3732792 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3732793 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3732794 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3732795 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by president dmitry medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3732796 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3732797 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
3732798 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
3732799 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
3732800 the russians are encroaching upon the capital they are making a circle
3732801 we will protect our capital until the last drop of our blood
3732802 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3732803 well frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft russians dont understand that kind of soft language
3732804 wow how many articles did iyazam com write that takes for ever

3732807 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3732808 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3732809 the whole web 2 0 explosion has moved from the consumer and college student world to professionals in the business world
3732810 employees are seeing this as a way of enlarging their sphere and interacting with colleagues
3732811 the new employee connection social networking behind the firewall as facebook like apps infiltrate the enterprise theyre integrating the workforce in unforeseen ways
3732812 they will not let themselves die without doing something they will react
3732813 the government acted quickly to remove tariffs on rice which everyone eats that quick action has kept people from taking to the streets
3732814 and since we have no channel for communicating with the authorities we have chosen the streets to show our discontent
3732815 after a number of years of phenomenal growth it is important we review our organizational structure to propel our future growth and continue to help our reps succeed
3732816 these appointments highlight one of our hidden strengths the depth of talent in our organization
3732817 it gives me great pleasure to elevate many of our leaders who have greatly contributed to our success
3732818 with their leadership we will continue to grow and help make it easier for our representatives and advisors to succeed and ultimately help their customers achieve their financial goals
3732819 dass die aufnahme von m dchen in die feuerwehrjugend in brunn am gebirge verweigert wird ist schlimm genug
3732820 aber wenn der landesfeuerwehrkommandant dies auch noch rechtfertigt und fragt warum sich die kollegen etwas antun sollten das nicht n tig ist dann handelt es sich dabei um eine ausgrenzung die absolut daneben ist
3732821 in anbetracht dessen dass viele freiwilligen organsiationen immer mehr schwierigkeiten haben geeignete helferinnen zu finden sollte man dabei nicht auch noch geschlechterspezifisch handeln
3732822 denn in weiten teilen des landes funktioniert die zusammenarbeit zwischen m nnern und frauen in der feuerwehr hervorragend
3732823 die ablehnung der aufnahme von frauen in den aktivstand der freiwilligen feuerwehr in brunn sehe ich ganz klar als diskriminierung ich hoffe dass es sich dabei um ein missverst ndnis handelt dass durch das geplante gespr ch mit der gleichbehandlungsbeauftragten des landes n aus der welt geschafft wird

3732846 having worked with him the last nine years i know he cant put things together he is not capable of that

3732860 none of these factors in isolation would have caused the very high increases we are seeing
3732861 the complex causes of the food and agriculture crisis require an equally complex and comprehensive response
3732862 from 1980 to 2005 aid to agriculture fell from 8 bn to 3 4 bn agricultures share of official development assistance fell from 17 per cent in 1980 to 3 per cent in 2006
3732863 we believe the most comprehensive way to deal with high food prices hunger and poverty is to invest in agriculture and raise food production

3732894 the deaths of four army wives in six weeks this summer at fort bragg n
3732895 it is estimated that two thirds of female service members experience unwanted uninvited sexual behavior in the military
3732896 to exemplify the magnitude of this problem consider what would happen if the u
3732897 several problems link the complaints of the women who reported assaults to the miles foundation
3732898 an army soldier who reported being raped last november in a camp in kuwait that was a staging area for the iraq war said she felt superiors ignored her assault and injuries according to a spokesman for rep
3732899 the recent allegations fit a pattern of female troops who have been sexually assaulted by servicemen in combat zones
3732900 the latest accusations come a year after reports of commanders indifference to sexual assaults at the air force academy while the pentagon reassigned the commanders it failed to address the broader issue of sexual assaults in the military or commit to better protect female
3732901 the pentagon declined to comment on individual cases but said it does not tolerate sexual misconduct commanders have a duty to prevent assaults protect victims and punish attackers it says in 1994 the pentagon started a program to assist victims and encourage their help in prosecutions
3732902 the militarys efforts to crack down on sexual assaults are hampered in part by the reluctance of some victims to report their attacks
3732903 in spite of victims reluctance to step forward enough assault accusations have been lodged to prompt closer scrutiny that is the best way to determine why women who protect their country get so little protection themselves from the pentagon
3732904 legal and regulatory changes need to be made in the current inspection system to better protect the approximately 10 billion animals killed for food each year in the united states

3732909 the death of slobodan milosevic a setback for the improvement of effective international criminal law
3732910 forthcoming trials of milosevics lieutenants would provide the opportunity for the prosecution to fully explain what happened
3732911 we americans would say that europe should say quite clearly that the future of those countries would be as members of eu and that we at nato should also send that same strong signal
3732912 our business in europe isnt finished because the balkans remains an island in the heart of europe that is not connected to the great trans atlantic institutions eu and nato
3732913 great strategic objective of every american administration going all the way back to the beginning of the cold war was that europe should be free and in peace and we are nearly of achieving that great strategic objective
3732914 the process of european unification will not be completed unless the countries of the western balkans become members of the european union

3732946 africa played a decisive role in the forma tion of christian culture
3732947 well meaning european and american historians have a tilted perception of the relation of african and european intellectual history in the third and fourth centuries and thus at the apex of african influence
3732948 this is what the book is about to state the african seedbed hypothesis in a measured way and begin to sort out the facts that support it
3732949 if a text was written in africa it will be treated as african
3732950 if africans were saying that they want their sources to come from africa alone and not from anywhere else then that would be deficient in the catholic spirit but this is not the direction of african expectations they seek a fair hearing for valid arguments based on evidence
3732951 it is precisely from the ancient african sources that global christianity can relearn that the church guided by the spirit is never irretrievably fallen away from the truth
3732952 they now have the benefit of learning about conflict resolution from their ancient african mentors from that history they learn that not every difference of opinion is demonic and not every union is of god
3732953 the brilliant instruction and guidance of early african christian texts and witnesses stand ready to nourish this regrounding
3732954 the meaning of the struggle of the early african martyrs begs to be understood in modern africa
3732955 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3732956 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3732957 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
3732958 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline
3732959 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3732960 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3732961 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3732962 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3732963 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion
3732964 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3732965 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3733001 ruby on rails has pretty much nuked the field of web development in ruby and i wonder if its such a good thing for all the flak that java receives because you can count at least a dozen different web frameworks there is something to be said about plurality and the constant chase for something better and different each framework that comes out builds on the strengths of its ancestors while discarding the errors and committing a few mistakes of its own of course the field advances a little bit every time while bowing down to the timeless laws of natural selection i am worried that ruby on rails will do to the ruby world what junit did to java a great tool when it came out but which condemned its community to an ice age where no innovation or competition appeared for years whatever the fate of ruby i hope its fans will keep an open mind and will constantly challenge the rails way for the simple reason that its always healthy to question whats in place no matter how good it looks

3733016 criminals very rarely use such guns worse yet these politicians work to pass laws that disarm the law abiding citizens while they themselves are gun control is sexist guns allow a little old lady to fend off a larger and stronger attacker they allow a young woman to stop a criminal from attacking her at the door to her home guns enable a pregnant woman to stop two home invaders in short guns allow the physically weaker members of society to defend themselves against the physically stronger members of society since as a matter of biology and perhaps our cultural norms men tend to be larger and stronger than women and can often overpower them physically that means that banning guns puts the women at a relative disadvantage even if the gun ban were to keep guns out of the hands of everyone now take into account the fact that criminals will break the law and still have guns and the disarmed women are at an even greater disadvantage gun control is ignorance politicians will go on television to argue in favor of gun bans without even understanding what they are trying to ban an example congresswoman mccarthy assault weapon

3733041 verwunderlich ist nur warum die conti aktie nun nicht auf diese 75 euro steigt vermutlich weil schaeffler noch nichts offiziell best tigt hat
3733042 hard to see how the claim could be convincingly substantiated
3733043 a level and gcse grades achieved in 2007 certainly do correspond to a lower level of general academic ability than the same grades would have done in previous years
3733044 whether or not they are better taught makes no difference to this interpretation the same grade corresponds to a lower level of general ability
3733045 the quality of work presented for examination may well be equal to or better than that of candidates in previous years
3733046 however given identical conditions todays candidates might nevertheless be unable to match the performance of their predecessors
3733047 the government has been undermining a levels for the last few years
3733048 we are determined to restore public confidence in the a level as the gold standard of british education
3733049 weve commented on durham universitys research time and time again
3733050 their work is quite different to gcse or a level as it uses aptitude tests which are not directly comparable to performance at gcse and a level
3733051 comparing like schools with like schools to measure differences in school results
3733052 were not talking about anything as simplistic and silly as league tables
3733053 but we are talking about parents and the community understanding what kinds of students are in schools their socio economic status the number of indigenous students the number of students with disabilities because that obviously means the schools have special needs
3733054 the aim should be to robustly ascertain what mix of capacities and needs children are bringing to their school
3733055 we need this information in order to understand what schools in turn should offer to these students and how governments and communities working together can support schools to do so
3733056 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools
3733057 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it specifically we should be identifying excellent teaching and excellent school leadership we must expect high standards of every child
3733058 there is considerable concern with proposals to excessively tag students and schools with various labels for little purpose
3733059 nsw is responsible for the welfare and education of its students and is committed to the constructive application of the outcomes of assessment in all its forms
3733060 its like hospitals its the rules around that ranking because if youre going to stand in a hospital and its a similar example with schools like westmead and compare it for example with a small district hospital like canterbury and then attempt in some way from the straight statistics that appear on that list to rank those two hospitals you would not be comparing like with like
3733061 public schools nationwide require an immediate 1 4 billion per annum to raise retention rates to 90 per cent and a further 1 3 billion per annum to ensure that all primary school age children reach the minimum benchmark scores for literacy and numeracy
3733062 these arrests are a significant development in our fight against the organised criminal gangs responsible for this type of fraud
3733063 whereas fraudsters used to put pinhole cameras above the chip and pin device to get hold of the pin number they now manipulate the chip and pin terminal to get that basic data
3733064 they are getting hold of the pin from inside the reader
3733065 they steal readers from retailers cracking them open and try to recreate one and then put it back in a shop
3733066 we have been aware that this has been going on because police have been getting reports that terminals are being stolen
3733067 were not saying that this was the only gang in the country but the good news is that on this occasion we were successful in stopping it

3733126 gospel was not at all what she thought it was
3733127 lenders have been lambasted from all sides the financial services authority has accused them of treating customers unfairly and not helping people through their difficulties and the citizens advice bureau accused them of aggressive behaviour and using court action as a first rather than last resort
3733128 if lenders had provided more affordable mortgage ppi policies that match my prices i suspect more people would be able to keep their homes although not all those struggling to make repayments have lost an income due to redundancy it is a key factor homeowners who lose their wage could wait up to nine months for any government help in meeting their mortgage payments as support has been delayed from six months if they had ppi they would receive back to day one payments and have their mortgage repayments met for up to a year
3733129 i worry far more families than this will be affected which is why lenders must act now and stop offering cover that is at least four times more expensive than mine
3733130 this cover wont solve everyones financial problems but it will at least help those who do face the threat of redundancy lenders have a duty of care to make this insurance affordable and easily accessible
3733131 the countrys labyrinthine network of law enforcement censorship and surveillance apparatuses has reimposed a straitjacket over the populace
3733132 over all the games are having a negative impact on human rights it has stunted the growth of civil society and civil organizations
3733133 public security has been put in the drivers seat for the preparation of the olympics and thats why we see so many unjustified and unreasonable restrictions and once you give these powers to the security ministry its hard to take them back
3733134 we should mobilize the masses of the people to contribute to the security of the games
3733135 in the past two months the police have followed me for a total of 10 days it never happened to me before
3733136 this government is bent on recentralizing policy and authority generally so this tightening will not be temporary
3733137 i think that we will look back upon these games as representing not a move towards political reform or rethinking power but bolstering the confidence of officials that they can indeed micromanage events
3733138 for all too many officials these games are not about international co operation but about chinese power
3733139 afterwards people were very scared they even stopped going to the monasteries to spin prayer wheels and chant sutras a fact that tells us that the dalai lama is the real criminal who is destroying tibetan buddhism
3733140 we must learn lessons from this issue and organise our masses to build up an impregnable fortress against the tide of encirclement to beat our enemy
3733141 but we are far from final victory because the dalai lama group which was exploited by western enemy forces is making a new plan for separatism
3733142 so you the leaders of work units must guard your gates and manage your people well let leaders of street committees be vigilant and keep watch on all outsiders
3733143 propaganda and education are our partys greatest advantages these are the most useful weapons with which to defend ourselves against the dalai lama group so let the propaganda department work more actively to expose its plots
3733144 each department should make full use of those religious people who love the motherland and love religion in order to make the administrative committees work with vigour
3733145 we must clean out the monasteries and strengthen the administrative committees
3733146 a wolf in monks clothes a devil with a human face
3733147 the central government has used the whole countrys resources to help tibet since its peaceful liberation and has allowed tibet to achieve thousands of years of progress in just a few decades
3733148 proponents of the ban say that the ban contains exceptions we do not believe that these are exceptions
3733149 of course even if it did contain exceptions we would oppose the ban let me just be clear about that
3733150 they are so narrowly drawn as to be completely useless to us as a vehicle to justify abortion on demand
3733151 the exceptions arent wide enough to drive a truck through
3733152 we have tried the route of justice that has failed us
3733153 to cut off the sinner from all reliance upon himself his merits and his powers and throw him naked and helpless into the hands of the holy spirit to lead him to christ in faith should be the one great aim of the ministry

3733157 because each human person has inherent dignity independent of his or her economic value work is designed to benefit the person not the other way around in this era of economic globalization it is all the more important to remember that people should always take priority over profit workers in the catholic social tradition have essential human rights to a just and living wage that will support workers families to organize and bargain collectively through trade unions to safe and to humane working conditions and to leisure time to spend with their friends and families employees have a responsibility to hold up their end of the bargain but so too must employers take an active role in protecting these essential rights

3733206 there are a lot of patients out there who are taking statins who could save a lot of money by splitting a larger tablet or perhaps even moving to a lower cost statin and splitting a larger tablet of that statin and save even more money
3733207 typically the difference between a split tablet where theres a little bit more on one half of the tablet than on the next fragment it cant possibly make any meaningful difference in terms of the drugs effect
3733208 but it definitely can to the users pocketbook its very much like buying any other commodity in bulk whether you buy cereal or flower or rice or sugar most people will buy it in a larger size
3733209 if one is going to take a drug for a few weeks say an antibiotic if you pay 35 compared with 10 its not usually a big deal
3733210 but if youre going to take it for years or potentially the rest of your life its a huge deal where the cash out of your pocket is after tax income
3733211 yes its absolutely wonderful if youre looking at drugs where you dont need the exact exact exact dose where you can be off by a little bit and its fine
3733212 absolutely industry knows about this and theyre definitely thinking ok what do we do about it
3733213 if theres a huge market shift towards pill splitting i bet you theres going to be a response from industry
3733214 if a tablet is cut in half the accuracy of the dosage cannot be predicted
3733215 an intact tablet is meant to dissolve and be absorbed at a certain rate which may occur faster when the tablet is broken this may lead to adverse events due to faster absorption of the product or to lessened efficacy due to product degradation

3733241 our movement fights on because we cannot allow the foundational crime at the core of the jewish state the violent expulsion from our lands and villages that made us refugees to slip out of world consciousness forgotten or negotiated away judaism which gave so much to human culture in the contributions of its ancient lawgivers and modern proponents of tikkum olam has corrupted itself in the detour into zionism nationalism and apartheid

3733246 talking about unread books invites us into a realm of authentic creativity
3733247 viii encounters with someone you love in which we see along with bill murray and his groundhog that the ideal way to seduce someone by speaking about books he or she loves without having read them yourself would be to bring time to a halt
3733248 only such an artificial halting of time and language would allow someone else to reproduce the texts buried within us in real life these texts are caught up in an irresistible movement that transforms them constantly and renders all hope of overlap impossible for if our inner books like our fantasies are relatively stable the screen books about which we speak endlessly are perpetually being modified as we shall see and it is futile to imagine we can put a stop to their metamorphoses

3733258 what am i doing each day to serve my wife that involves sacrifice that costs me something
3733259 sacrifice so that an environment is created that is conducive for growth in godliness for our wives
3733260 if a husband is not growing in godliness there is no sacrifice he can make to ensure that his wife grows in godliness
3733261 the norm is to be a husband whose zeal is at least similar to and in my c j s opinion superior to his wifes
3733262 at covenant life we do not want kids growing up thinking of passion for god as a female quality
3733263 can i provide her with perspective so she is not overwhelmed with areas needing growth can i help her prioritize

3733271 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3733272 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3733273 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3733274 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3733275 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3733276 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3733277 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3733278 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3733279 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3733281 how many gym trips and treadmill runs gloria have to do in the next 4 years
3733282 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3733283 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3733284 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3733285 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3733295 if crude inventories have increased more than envisaged or gasoline stocks fallen less than predicted a further retreat in oil prices could be triggered
3733296 the whole crisis hardly mattered much to the energy markets to start with as participants were left cold by the fighting all along however the fact that the fighting is declared to be officially over arguably opened the way yesterday for more energy related selling to set in
3733297 with the dollar strengthening the whole purpose of putting money in oil relatively speaking has diminished somewhat

3733339 while time and space form a classic duality in social science this article demonstrates a perspective on time space and materiality as a core trinity as a prominent figure in contemporary discussions on materiality in the social sciences science and technology studies sts emphasizes relational approaches sts however lacks a clear relational definition of materiality and tends instead to focus on the agency of entities on for instance material agency the article suggests a relational definition of materiality and notes that this move implies turning the question of the time of materiality into an empirical question it is argued that relational materiality must be studied spatially and thus a spatial approach describing patterns of relations is presented
3733340 as both parties gear up for the election this is a perfect opportunity for them to articulate their space policies
3733341 both candidates have been making statements regarding space policy lately and were hoping this debate will help clarify their respective plans and what they hope to accomplish

3733346 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3733347 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3733348 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3733349 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3733350 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion
3733351 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3733352 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3733353 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3733354 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3733355 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3733356 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3733357 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3733358 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3733359 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well
3733360 vanderbilt in so many ways is already a great place for undergraduates and the commons is the answer to the question of how do we improve on a proven recipe for success our graduates accomplish amazing things and our faculty are top researchers and excellent teachers however we wanted to challenge ourselves to define a new model of residential education for the 21st century one that educates the whole student
3733361 we might have a major speaker come to campus and have dinner with students at the deans residence or invite distinguished physicians from our medical center over to an apartment to chat informally about how they became doctors and we definitely will watch vanderbilt sports teams on tv at my house

3733373 what microsoft has been able to accomplish in the living room has been awe inspiring and we are pleased to be a part of the story
3733374 there has been a man arrested for burglary this morning at an address in shieldfield
3733375 that man is currently detained at pilgrim street police station
3733376 he was not arrested in connection with the murder investigation
3733377 officers from the major investigation team are looking into the circumstances of that burglary and his arrest
3733378 you expect the unexpected when it comes to the business side of the game
3733379 as a player ive always said ill do what i can do and dont even get involved in it
3733380 hes a true competitor wherever he is hes going to be a benefit to that team hes a great teammate a great leader and i think hell do well
3733381 im trying to learn the system and get better every day
3733382 thatll be good cause a lot of things they do have applications to other teams well see during the course of the year in all three phases of the game
3733383 this is a real good opportunity for our football team going down there playing in a little warmer weather playing a good football team that has a lot of tough schemes to deal with will make for a good week for us
3733384 we will keep the best football players the ones that help our football team the most whoever they are if we would keep four quarterbacks i would think we could keep five running backs
3733385 sammys done everything weve asked him to do during camp
3733386 they must be saying we cant keep our sites up but we dont think russian hackers can take down blogspot given googles much better infrastructure and ability to defend it
3733387 another interesting aspect is seeing how certain countries are what i call cyberlocked
3733388 we know a land locked country has no access to the sea
3733389 color creates an aesthetic emotion if its a color that the customer loves if it gives them that sense of balance and comfort theyll want it it can make or break a sale
3733390 the colors we chose had a lot to do with architecture using a premium paint for our premium cars is to enhance the exterior architecture of the car by giving it a luxurious liquid look
3733391 the one thing we were really excited about was this was the first year we were able to have a black metallic that really enhances the form
3733392 youll see in the color palette and in the paints that weve enhanced them by using different type of flakes
3733393 color and emotion are tied in together and buying a car is a very emotional thing for a lot of people
3733394 a car is really an extension of your personality an extension of who you are and how you want to be perceived
3733395 i had a client who was very successful in the insurance industry
3733396 he was kind of a gray guy he drove a very practical car and was very reserved the first thing he did when he retired was buy a red sports car
3733397 to him that car represented a change of lifestyle it was colorful sexy it was fun to drive
3733398 people might think oh its so shallow of me so they wont acknowledge it
3733399 we have to look at where the industry is moving whats doing well and how it evolves
3733400 you have to take a holistic approach to design to look inside and out
3733401 as a painter and a sculptor i understand when color is applied to form what works and what doesnt you know when its right it has to be harmonious it has to sing you have to put a product out there that people know just feels right
3733402 maybe they dont even know why they love it they just know that it makes them feel good
3733403 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games said kevan gosper vice chairman of the iocs coordination commission for beijing
3733404 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3733405 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3733406 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3733407 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3733408 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3733409 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3733410 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3733411 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3733412 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3733413 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3733414 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3733415 when i see buildings like this i feel like ive got to paint it before its gone
3733416 i love the colors and the light as well as the forms and the architecture
3733417 i think there should be a balance somehow keeping whats here and preserving it
3733418 of course i like to paint the older stuff better but its cool against all these subdued and muted earth colors and rusted out things to suddenly see bright blues and yellows popping out
3733419 its a statistic that got away from us last year
3733420 we havent been a dominant defense in this league in a long time but weve got to get better
3733421 weve got to make sure we get our guys in the box not only the linemen and linebackers but also the free safety weve got to get a physical presence and be able to win games in the fourth quarter when people are trying to run us down and wear us down
3733422 a lot of times we were at the ball and we didnt make plays on the ball
3733423 the running back position the wide outs weve got a great offensive line we might expand a couple things but its not going to be a real noticeable difference were not going to go the wing option or something crazy
3733424 i feel more like a veteran on the team now than a rookie
3733425 i know the offense a lot better than i did the past couple years when i get out there im more confident in what im doing and the coaches have more confidence in me
3733426 he should be a starter on every special team for us
3733427 certainly he can make a lot of contributions in a lot of areas for us
3733428 not an suv not a wagon not a coupe and not a sedan we aimed for a more road focused vehicle and sporty direction
3733429 we used toyotas design philosophy vibrant clarity to create a more exciting drive for the customer while still maintaining its high functionality
3733430 the overall stance of the vehicle is very strong with the wheels placed out to make it look sure footed and glued to the ground
3733431 most car interiors are like dual cockpits where both driver and front passengers feel as if they only have access to 40 percent of the available space
3733432 the flow of venzas center console is a bit of an optical illusion
3733433 both driver and passenger will feel as if 60 percent of the space is in their personal zone
3733434 we need to continue to develop products that are smart and practical
3733435 but given the competitive landscape of todays marketplace they must also evoke an emotional response
3733436 this plant is an example of how we are proactively pursuing two key aspects of gms global strategy
3733437 the first is the accelerated application of alternative fuels and propulsion systems to reduce global dependency on fossil fuels the second is growth in the emerging markets including the asean region as a key factor in our continued global leadership
3733438 diesel engines play a very important role in gms global advanced propulsion strategy we are leveraging expertise and resources within our company and through our technology partnerships to ensure we develop the worlds best engines this investment will also support manufacturing and grow advanced propulsion technology capability in thailand and across asia pacific
3733439 the new facility will be a state of the art highly flexible and people focused production complex that incorporates gms leading manufacturing strategies we are bringing the best gm has to offer to ensure that our customers receive the cleanest and most efficient diesel engine technology available add to this our work with cng cellulosic ethanol bio diesel and regular gasoline and it is clear that general motors is quickly becoming the energy diversity vehicle manufacturer in thailand

3733460 this acquisition is another building block in nortels vision to be a software centric company and the leading provider of unified communications solutions
3733461 we believe that bringing pingtels critical r amp d capabilities in house will enable us to further develop software based solutions that go beyond the boundaries of our previous oem relationship we expect that this will enable nortel to accelerate the development of new it centric channels to market
3733462 pingtel has established itself as a unified communications vendor with market leading very sophisticated solutions based on interoperable software that can run on a multitude of hardware platforms
3733463 the acquisition of pingtel corp by nortel is the next logical step that will further accelerate adoption of the technology and solutions on a global basis we are very excited to become part of nortel the leading provider in the market for unified communications
3733464 our strategy to diversify cae geographically between civil and military markets and between products and services provides us with a level of stability and predictability
3733465 no company is immune to economic and market fluctuations but the majority of our revenue is now derived from military or recurring training revenue sources we remain positive about our long term opportunities we have continued to use our flexibility to make bolt on acquisitions to selectively expand our capabilities and enhance our market position
3733466 we dont want to be rushing into a decision this timetable will enable us to establish a deep pool of candidates from which we can choose a person who will be in that position for a long period of time
3733467 we believe it is going to be a valuable and worthy program for both the courts and the authority as we will be able to have mr
3733468 once we have this up and running i will move forward with it in belmont county on july 23 i introduced it to our belmont county judges and told them to consider the same as we were implementing it in jefferson
3733469 if all goes well the authority hopes to hire an additional community service coordinator in belmont county so we can work the same clean up program our county roads have too much litter and this program will be very beneficial to all in both counties
3733470 we feel it is essential to form a litter control community service program we are requesting that the solid waste authority fund and provide such a program we believe that having an administrator oversee this program would result in effective litter control in all areas of the county
3733471 will concentrate on roadside litter cleanup as well as illegal dump sites in the county and we can also use them at our recycling stations if necessary
3733472 the current statutory tipping fees call for 1 a ton from in district solid waste going to the landfill 2 a ton for in state but out of district solid waste and 1 for out of state solid waste coming into the apex landfill there also is an additional 50 cents per ton fee for all out of state tonnage
3733473 our current contract with the apex landfill expires dec 31 so we would like to have this issue resolved and ready to go forward before jan 1 the law allows us to raise the statutory tipping fees or the contract fees or a combination of both that is something our subcommittee will explore with apex
3733474 we will begin our work immediately and are confident we will reach an amicable resolution to the matter sometime no later than this fall
3733475 the opening is really going to be nice and exciting

3733491 both of them have reasons as to why they wouldnt necessarily want to move to ubuntu the old story from isvs is why would we move to another os vendor when it might cannibalize what we have already we would have to retrain all of our people

3733524 i was born into a generation of ninnies it has made me tired
3733525 i believe in the soul the cock the pussy the small of a womans back the hanging curve ball high fiber good scotch long foreplay show tunes and that the novels of susan sontag are self indulgent overrated crap
3733526 i like to attend and be an active member of the builders association and use that as a means of networking there also i suggest visiting lumberyards and asking the managers who are good custom builders that come into their store take an interest in what they do
3733527 builders are looking for the agent to have basic construction knowledge i believe crs 201 is a quality building course and is really good then basically enthusiasm and attentiveness they also like good marketing pieces that promote them as a builder and they want to see your referrals if you have lots of land listed make up a book with all of your plats c amp rs etc give all builders a copy of the book this way they can stay up to date with your listed properties and have all of the information available to them when they need it this will make you look organized and prepared
3733528 to find how builders are rated ask around town other developers surveyors agents etc also ask the builder for referrals of people they have built for and call them ask them how the builder was on callbacks how they were on overruns when building do they charge for changes how about offering a 2 10 home warranty on their properties
3733529 what are some marketing tips you can give me on directing traffic to my model homes
3733530 these may sound basic but put lots of signage around the neighborhood
3733531 thanks for the question elaine turning over the guest list is a great tool i stay in total control of the model greet clients at the front door i also ask them to sign the guest list in the kitchen and when i get to the kitchen i hand them the pen seldom do i not get signatures i make a copy for the builder and i keep the original for myself to follow up on be sure to negotiate in writing your commission rate with the builder up front even if you are friends too many times will you negotiate the offer to purchase and the builder will then negotiate your commission
3733532 in your marketing do you focus on the builder and his building abilities or do you focus on the sub division in you ads and encourage buyers to come view your wonderful builders
3733533 terry in my marketing i focus on the subdivision this is what will draw clients to the model they know what area they want to live in and some may be familiar with the builders reputation but most will not focus on the subdivision and the house
3733534 to promote these homes for the next 30 days especially at this time of the year have these homes open every sunday send emails to all area realtors letting them know this home will be open
3733535 100 financing or no closing costs which you may be able to roll into the financing
3733536 cathy do you ever represent competing builders in the same subdivision
3733537 competing builders in the same subdivision this does happen often with me if i do i treat them both as sellers of mine in the same subdivision you cant promote one over the other promote them equally hold them both open at the same hours days have both homes in the same ads
3733538 cathy when you are talking commission what is your usual set up with them i mean who pays for ads promotions etc in our area builders are trying to negotiate your fees and asking us to pay for the ads
3733539 michael regarding commission rates again i try to treat the builders the same as a regular listing pay for all of the advertising just as you normally would on any listing your doing the same amount of advertising for them as you would anyone maybe a little more but they will bring you repeat listings and business i may give the builder a percent discount due to this fact as well
3733540 cathy what price level do you mostly work in and are the homes more
3733541 nancy price range of homes i would say the production homes are typically lower end price ranges anywhere from 110 140 the custom homes built are usually higher from 150 400 i know its a large range but it is true for our area i work more with production homes though
3733542 cathy how many builders do you represent at one time
3733543 i typically dont work with more than 2 3 builders at a time
3733544 yes i have had this happen again treat them both the same promote their houses the same and try to explain to them when you have their home advertised also show these homes to your own clients as much as possible this is a huge issue here they want to see you being proactive in selling their house to your clients
3733545 cathy how many spec homes are your builders building at a time or
3733546 the builders i work with typically build approximately 20houses per year

3733606 it is the families intention for the media to be facilitated at this service details of which will be confirmed in due course
3733607 in the meantime the media are asked to continue to respect our wishes to be able to grieve in private and to try and come to terms with the terrible events of the past few weeks

3733669 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3733670 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3733671 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3733672 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3733673 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3733674 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3733675 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3733676 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3733677 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3733678 ive seen an awful lot of them im starting to get a pretty good picture one way or the other i need to see certainly more chad pennington need to see him we need to get him more familiar with what it is that were doing out here and let the players become a little bit more friendly with him that way at the same time with henne hes a young quarterback that i think needs as many reps as he can get as well
3733679 many of you as i looked into your faces when you saw me coming back youve seen ive changed a little bit
3733680 first of all i want to apologize to you because youre all going to go through something that no other nfl team will have to endure
3733681 you will have to see a man walk out before you to his possible death
3733682 it seems like he is so much faster than everybody else out there
3733683 he sees holes quickly i know there was one he wished he would have had back he catches the ball well he runs the ball well he sets up blocks well hes a complete back he is dangerous on third down on screens
3733684 im ready to get it solved and move on the longer i stay here the worse its going to get
3733685 i think the facilities and the weather certainly were great for us we got a lot of work done i thought technique work especially i think it will pay off for us
3733686 i dont even feel like i should be out here practicing or going into the preseason but its something nobody else feels like is affecting anything so im out there practicing and playing games
3733687 but i try not to pay attention to a lot of things in the media dont pat ourselves on the back none of us do on the o line if you start believing youre good thats when your technique falls apart
3733688 but being in the oxygen tent here means i can work with sparring partners during the day

3733691 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3733692 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3733693 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3733694 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3733695 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3733696 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3733697 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3733698 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3733699 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3733700 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3733701 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3733702 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3733703 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3733704 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3733705 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3733706 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3733707 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3733708 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3733709 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3733710 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3733711 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3733712 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3733713 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3733714 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3733715 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3733716 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3733717 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3733718 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3733719 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3733720 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3733721 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3733722 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3733723 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3733724 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3733725 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3733726 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3733727 since indiana is pretty much everyones home we are all familiar with camp atterbury and that makes the training and transition to deployment a lot easier
3733728 this training has been a great refresher for those who were in the unit and deployed a few years ago
3733729 but we also have about half of our unit who wasnt here for that deployment and this is good training to prepare them for what to expect
3733730 so i decided to volunteer for the 1538th deployment and be with my wife instead
3733731 its going to be hard not seeing them for a while but i know they are in good hands with their mother and her family
3733732 this is my third deployment in five years so i have learned how to be a part of my familys lives all the way from iraq
3733733 technology today like webcams and email makes communication a lot easier
3733734 although soldiers pulled together from multiple places we have a very cohesive and family oriented group
3733735 we also have a very strong leadership and experienced noncommissioned officers so overall we just have a good group to deploy with all around
3733736 we are thrilled to welcome the mv agusta family of customers and employees into the harley davidson family of premium motorcycle brands
3733737 our primary focus with this acquisition is to grow our presence and enhance our position in europe as a leader in fulfilling customers dreams complementing the harley davidson and buell motorcycle families
3733738 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3733739 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3733740 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3733741 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3733742 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3733743 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3733744 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3733745 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3733746 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3733747 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3733748 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3733754 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3733755 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3733756 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3733757 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3733758 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3733759 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3733760 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3733761 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3733762 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3733763 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3733764 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3733765 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3733766 i need a crowd of people but i cant face them day to day

3733777 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3733778 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3733779 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3733780 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3733781 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3733782 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3733783 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3733784 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3733785 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3733786 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3733787 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3733788 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3733789 who are open to doing something on the production side
3733790 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3733791 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3733792 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3733793 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3733794 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3733795 of course they are entitled to take things from georgians now because they lost their own property in tskhinvali and other places
3733796 isnt that what they georgians have been doing to us these old people shouldnt be complaining they should be happy they werent killed
3733797 acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population
3733798 the russian government should be held to this promise to punish looters but much more needs to be done to ensure that all sides protect civilians
3733799 tell your men not to open fire if they dont shoot we arent going to shoot either
3733800 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3733801 we are getting crucified and i dont know why i cant tell you that
3733802 i cant believe some of the comments about phelps he is a supreme athlete its just a case of swimming appearing a bit boring to some people he has shown that he can rise to the top in many different types of race using different techniques in each where is the runner who can win the 100m 10 000m and hurdles its only running after all
3733803 it helps being positive nervous because youve been waiting four years for this i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster i raced as well as i could i cannot affect what others do theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3733804 if we have another consistent day today and tomorrow then i think well be set up to have some good medal races and ultimately get ourselves into a position in those medal races where were in the running to go for a medal
3733805 i am an ex international rower who has competed all over the world and also i have competed in triathlon what phelps is doing is extraordinary by any standard simon your comment that suggested swimming is one dimensional is rather questionable phelps is winning gold medals in various disciplines which require a completely different set of swimming skills to achieve if you have ever swam then you would know that the back stroke is the complete opposite to the freestyle the butterfly requires a completely different body movement through the water as does the breaststroke the fact that michael phelps has achieved such a complete all round perfection of the various strokes is in itself demonstrating what an outstanding athlete he is the fact that he is doing it winning gold medals and breaking world records is to me just wow i can only sit here in complete admiration to the discipline he has shown to achieve such heights just to highlight my point slightly more if carl lewis can win gold in 100m 200m 4x100m and a long jump does that not mean athletics is one dimensional as well as it is just all running in the end of the day or is it he was just an exceptional athlete who outclassed his peers
3733806 judging by medals alone is biased towards multi discipline events such as swimming and gymnastics 8 of the top 10 medal winners are either gymnasts or swimmers so calling phelps the
3733807 no you just have to ride like you never have to breathe again
3733808 if youre a good swimmer you have much more opportunity to win medals in the pool we have biathlons pentathlons and decathlons how about dodecathletes yes 20 disciplines lets see the swimmers enter the boxing ring the relay runners perform on the parallel bars the three day eventers shoots clay pigeons and the tennis players all pro play doubles badmington when will rugby league be an olympic sport so they can play full contact beach volley ball the olympics is a celebration of certain sports the competion is great and exciting a boxer can only win one medal but a swimmer can win 10 if his team mates are competent
3733809 i dont wish other readers to misunderstand of course i recognise and respect phelps achievements in the pool it just doesnt seem right to proclaim him greatest olympian in a very one dimensional discipline if pole vaulting had three diffferent run up distances and two types of pole material then undoubtedly sergei bubka wouldve earned about 18 golds in his career unfortunately he could win but one at each games as for greatest olympian what about fanny blankers coen a mother of two and aged 30 she won four golds on the track in 1948 and was prevented from entering long jump and high jump for which she held the world records maybe its the awful sycophantic commentary i have to endure here in hong kong that deters me from being more enthusiastic about phelps and his medal haul
3733810 phelps is an awesome athlete but swimming has far too many events attached to it with all the different strokes relays and medleys in track and field you do not have a gold medal for hopping side skipping and running backwards in high jump there are not three gold medals one for the flop one for the splits and one for the forward roll its a simple case of fastest highest end of story medal tables and individual medal tallies are artificially inflated and bias towards events in the pool and probably gymnastics too
3733811 why are we making a big deal about people winning golds in world record time havent they all been won in either an olympic or world record maybe the new thing should be sr speedo records
3733812 i think anyone who dedicates years of their life to just achieve the title an olympian deserves all the plaudits they get to mount that podium must be awesome and to do it 10 times is unbelievable i just wish i had a portion of the talent of these athletes
3733813 i have to disagree strongly about limiting an athlete to only one individual event it is the difference between the world championships and the olympics for the former event i agree that a limit could should be set but for the olympics it is precisely in the spirit of its history to find the worlds greatest olympian and that obviously cannot involve limiting an athlete to one single event
3733814 so what you are saying is that we should penalise the best athletes in the world because they are better than everybody else that makes absolutely no sense if phelps was british we would be right behind him michael phelps is going to go down as one of the greatest athletes and greatest olympians of all time and we should be applauding what he is doing not criticising him for it
3733815 i cant disagree more with the previous poster that said its not fair one person can go for so many golds i dont think anyone is fooled that in some disciplines theres more medals on offer but we have the opportunity for someone to do something quite special in this olympics if he gets it no one will fail to see what a remarkable champion phelps is
3733816 i am ex pat in melbourne and the tv coverage is predictably tedious endless commercials with some aussie medal hope squeezed in therefore relying on you for live updates of gbs chances i have a bet with an aussie colleague that gb will bag more golds so i am relying on you to deliver the booty
3733817 keep up the excellent coverage we dont get to see very much of the olympics over here in kazakhstan as we receive south african tv all they are interested in is rugby and the recent series defeat of england at cricket good to see they got beat by australia at the hockey
3733818 i am an expat watching live in the states keep the coverage coming and some of us are alive well amp watching by the way i am a happy ipswich fan after the carling cup win tonight also watching the red sox try to blow a ten run lead and they are doing a good job keep the faith
3733819 i am a brit currently working out in canada so the time difference is even worse i reckon on 11 hours from here to beijing my girlfriend and i are thouroughly enjoying all the coverage but its very annoying when we spot a team gb contestant and they move swiftly on
3733820 im a brit watcing the olympics from canada so thanks for keeping me up to date with the brits that are competing and arent getting to swimming finals and that are maybe finishing 17th in an archery tournament
3733821 i was gutted to see the french lose out by a fingertip in the relay the other day giving phelps another gold im fed up with all the hype surrounding this and in my opinion it highlights the ludicrous situation whereby one competitor can win so many medals competitors should be restricted to one individual event and as many team events as they choose then we would see a broader spectrum of swimmers more representative of that countries pool of talent pun intended
3733822 i am english but live and work in the philippines i just started work for the day 7 hours ahead of uk here and i have the live website up and running a great service i have to say there is little or no interest in the olympics here with the filipino nationals so not much tv coverage i am so pleased to have found your excellent website keep up the good work
3733823 we only get to see events in which an american has a medal chance and that is squeezed in between endless commercials oh how i would love to see some handball hockey or cycling

3733872 zain and glo two prominent telecommunication firms with international feel and operating in some countries in africa and the middle east are set to commence operations soon and thus any delay in the deal with vodafone will kill gt and thus throw several workers home
3733873 we are supporting vodafone because they happen to have what it takes to turn gt around and make it competitive in the telecom industry we have studied the full benefits of the vodafone deal and we are optimistic that the future of gt lies in the ratification of the agreement by the honorable members of parliament and we wish to call on them to go ahead with the process
3733874 we the concerned workers and ghanaians have much stake in the company and that our fact is based on business and not politics
3733875 the telecommunication industry is now a big business and so we need partners like vodafone to inject new technology and equipment to compete with mtn and tigo which are international brands
3733876 we seriously suspect that some power drunk parliamentary aspirants who want power badly must be behind these fresh killings
3733877 i wonder why the things i take pride in being are the reasons im nothing special
3733878 if the sale is not allowed to materialize competition will kill gt
3733879 we wish to call on them to go ahead with the process
3733880 we are challenging all the cja members to disclose their phone numbers for ghanaians to know whether they are using gt network or not
3733881 we are demonstrating today to show our support and explained the continued misrepresentation and misconception of the entire deal by people who know next to nothing on the issues but are arguing to their own advantage and seeking their own parochial interests
3733882 it is good that since one of the main contestants for the position of the running mate in the npp hajia alima mahama has been openly rejected by leading members of the party choosing any of the people who were openly competing with her would be a very big slight for her so going for a completely different person is a good strategy
3733883 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem

3733921 with the rapid evolution that java and open source frameworks have made since the release of j2ee enterprise java it seems to be producing too many java dinosaurs developers technical managers or architects who no longer pursue their technical skills dont understand the evolution of jee in comparison to j2ee persistence frameworks ioc frameworks web frameworks or web 2 0 and its effects on enterprise java yet decisions are made based on out of date j2ee experience

3733936 by the same token fidel realizes that he is no longer president and has to allow his successors to chart their own course within certain broad parameters

3733945 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3733946 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3733947 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3733948 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3733949 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3733950 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3733951 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3733952 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3733953 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well

3733958 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus

3734029 creativity is essentially an overwhelming presence of awareness and may very well be mindfulness and could be a form of meditation or it could be more like lucid dreaming outside of dreaming as in lucid wakefulness or it could be the state attained through the creative mind which seems to be on a whole different level of consciousness altogether
3734030 yes yes yes and can we throw the word otherness in there somehow as well creativity as an approaching of the divine via a process of lucid mindfulness that allows us to appreciate however briefly and superficially the intrinsic strangeness of everything other than oneself

3734044 were really trying to make sure we stay as fresh as we can so once the season starts with the long season were going to have were still fresh
3734045 we talked about it and i think really both guys felt like they didnt have their best year kicking last season

3734047 our team obviously has good offense defense and weve had ok special teams the last few years but weve been kind of average in those phases
3734048 weve kind of taken it upon ourselves to help our coverage teams by kicking the ball even further or higher
3734049 there are 11 guys on the field but if we can do our job even a little bit better it helps everybody else do theirs too
3734050 the more hang time and the more fair catches we can make those guys do and the more touchbacks that i can do its only going to help our chances

3734092 according to one of our sources the reggae superstar was caught and charged with possession of an unknown quantity of marijuana
3734093 and it gets worse according to mediatakeout coms snitch the whole thing went down at the uppsala reggae festival a well known event word is that undercover officers called for a raid when they spotted sean paul and a group of other artistes smoking marijuana which is illegal in sweden
3734094 x17 is hearing that sean paul and several other important artistes were searched by police and arrested for drug possession after performing at the uppsala reggae festival the cops were really intent on catching the rude boys red handed too they even sent police dogs to sean pauls room at the first hotel linne to check for contraband
3734095 sean paul has not been arrested sean was not arrested in sweden or in any other country he has not been charged with a crime anywhere in this world
3734096 it is my understanding that is was a routine police check but sean paul was not arrested and the tour is continuing smoothly

3734177 hi joe a few weeks ago you posted the article about receiving delmarva oils budget payment letter and how huge the increase was going to be for the upcoming year i posted a comment along with alot of other people who were not happy with the increase since our oil furnace was reaching the end of its life span my husband amp i applied and was approved for a home equity line of credit our thoughts are to put in central heat air and install replacement windows getting rid of a 322 mo oil bill and making our home more energy efficient we are just waiting for the appraisal to come in so the bank can establish the amount we can borrow the dmo letter stated that the first payment on the new budget year would be due on august 26th amp the bank is aware of this deadline and will have the amount of the heloc before then i was going to call dmo the very second we got the go ahead from the bank and with great pleasure tell them we would no longer be a customer on monday aug 11th i came home from work and found a receipt in the door showing that dmo had delivered 137 4 gallons of fuel oil i couldnt believe it 2 weeks before the first payment was even due theyve dumped 500 600 of oil in our tank wtf the first thought i had was entrapment when a company nearly doubles your payments and then before the first payment is due dumps hundreds of dollars of oil in your tank its as if they are thinking well get the budget plan pymts or 500 600 out of them before they cancel i havent called them yet i need to find out if we are responsible for paying for all this oil or will they come take this out and give us a credit i didnt ask for the delivery and i still had two weeks to end our business with them if you or any of your readers can answer this id appreciate it i dont want to make this call without having a plan of attack

3734183 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3734184 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3734185 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3734186 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3734187 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3734188 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3734189 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3734199 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
3734200 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

3734466 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3734467 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another
3734468 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch
3734469 you can also move the clock backwards on the server

3734472 our study found that combat deployment in support of the wars in iraq and afghanistan was significantly associated with new onset heavy weekly drinking binge drinking and other alcohol related problems among reserve guard and younger personnel after return from deployment
3734473 because alcohol use may serve as a coping mechanism after traumatic events it is plausible that deployment is associated with increased rates of alcohol consumption or problem drinking
3734474 i think this study is probably very accurate as part of the re entry process people will turn to coping mechanisms that are easily accessible and alcohol is easily available socially acceptable and quite effective for short term stress relief

3734496 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right

3734534 no thank you i do not want to sleep in the elevator
3734535 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3734536 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3734537 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3734538 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3734539 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3734540 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3734541 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling

3734561 we know that the address is the common link to many government databases
3734562 so it only makes sense that maintenance is the key to upholding the quality and accuracy of evolving datasets for many agencies thats easier said than done
3734563 many clients tell us they and their adjacent agencies have spent so much manpower collecting and recollecting data but still were unable to achieve the comprehensive and user friendly dataset ddti provided in a fraction of the time
3734564 we have always offered some form of maintenance support but the impact of this comprehensive data maintenance solution is much more immediate and far reaching
3734565 if minutes and sometimes seconds make the difference for 9 1 1 these agencies cant wait to receive updated data
3734566 we have mapped a lot of counties and worked with a lot of psaps so we know their first priority is having the accurate data to get their responders to a distress call this solution gives them that accuracy in a timely manner and does not disrupt the normal daily workflow environment

3734698 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3734699 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3734700 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3734701 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3734702 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3734703 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3734704 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3734705 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house

3734711 its still early in the games we just finished day four in 16 days of competition
3734712 when you look at the schedule some of the sports that we traditionally do well in take place later on
3734713 its a great thing when on the first day of the competition you already have a gold medal and we can all relax and know that canada is doing well
3734714 weve still got a lot of athletes who have yet to compete but certainly to see canada win a medal is something thats exciting for all of us
3734715 no one places more pressure on these athletes than themselves
3734716 they have pressure to get here and have pressure to get through the games
3734717 has canada ever done well during the summer olympics theyre a winter powerhouse though
3734718 canadians put way more pressure on professional sports do we value amateur sports in our country yeah i think we do but dont think we invest in it really heavily yet
3734719 the road to excellence program is a great start but i dont know if its been set up long enough to really see the effects yet in these olympic games

3734724 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3734725 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3734726 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3734727 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3734728 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3734729 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win
3734730 if they didnt quit tonight i dont think theyre ever going to quit
3734731 its great we knew that we had a very strong relay
3734732 we wanted to confirm we are the strongest relay in the world
3734733 we will have to swim faster in the final though because it will take another world record to win
3734734 i want to say that we have a great respect for the orient and their peoples some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3734735 whoever interprets something else from the photos has taken it completely the wrong way
3734736 to try and convert an affectionate gesture of a model group of sportsmen and women into racism is repugnant
3734737 that was the important thing thats really what were attempting to do is win series and go from there
3734738 to win three out of four against their pitching staff is pretty good
3734739 theyve got an outstanding staff and getting three is big
3734740 i also know im capable of pitching badly and it can change in a heartbeat
3734741 these screenings will check several blood indicators before the athletes compete
3734742 i dont want to get into whats behind us too much but hes okay hes still my team mate and still my best friend
3734743 i dont want to talk about that but what happened made me stronger more determined to do well
3734744 weve been working very hard but theres also politics the judges

3734748 dua nama yakni henrikus herikes dan salman muncul dalam keterangan anda
3734749 penyerahan pada salman dalam bap anda anda menyebut tahunnya tidak pasti namun anda menyebut pemberian 900 000 dolar as dalam bentuk pecahan 100 dan 50 dolar as di hotel hyatt
3734750 tidak tertekan diri saya tidak tertekan saya hanya ingin cepat selesai pemeriksaannya
3734751 keterangan anda ini ada di enam pertanyaan jadi anda bisa mengarang satu bap
3734752 apa waktu itu anda merasa tertekan kalau tertekan kita akan hadirkan penyidik kpk
3734753 bagaimana anda bisa merangkai tempat pertemuan nama henrikus herikes kajari salman hotel tempat penyerahan uang dan jumlah uang jadi anda menkhayal
3734754 anda menyebut henrikus herikes yang menyalurkan ke salman yang mengatur henrikus
3734755 itu cara berpikir saya dari pikiran saya yang tidak benar
3734756 asalkan satu atau dua pertanyaan atau hanya pada kalimat saja yang anda cabut karena anda ragu itu boleh tapi anda mencabut dari pertanyaan dari nomor 25 31
3734757 theyve started letting them out of the bus in front of our house
3734758 if were about to leave and someone yells star tours you hit the ground if you go down they cant see you
3734759 theyre both things that we cannot help i sympathize with my neighbors i wouldnt want to deal with that either were also victims of that though we dont want to deal with that they should be complaining to the city
3734760 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3734761 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3734762 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to
3734763 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
3734764 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3734765 we asians are nimbler its a smarter way to fight
3734766 with all those people backing me theres no way i could feel nervous or tense i just feel great

3734768 he injured his elbow its a dislocation hell be alright but its just an ugly thing
3734769 we play in a 40 over league and we cant suddenly say its a twenty over match
3734770 our 40 overs were played out in the hope the other 40 overs were playable and sadly that has not been the case
3734771 its a weather induced issue its normally rain that brings these things to a conclusion
3734772 its not good for cricket i am very sympathetic its unprecedented and i hope its not something that will happen again
3734773 we had a fair idea that was going to happen its a shame as we were in a decent position at the time
3734774 we want to perform even better than in osaka that is our intention
3734775 we were no 1 of the african countries in sydney and athens this time we want to keep that result its a very important result for us
3734776 were targeting a minimum four gold medals and 10 very big for such a small and poor country
3734777 therell be some events where we want to sweep the medals 1 2 3
3734778 the people want the gold theyre expecting gold medals in the distance events
3734779 in some if we dont get 1 2 3 theyll be disappointed
3734780 the cynical among us suspect icroa was set up because most offsetters will not qualify for defra accreditation
3734781 it is a sad situation in georgia and i would like to thank fifa for thinking about that and we will wait to see what fifa decide
3734782 i know that fifa will think about the calendar and for me it is important that the game will be played on september 6
3734783 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team
3734784 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open
3734785 we will have several days together which will be very important we have a lot of work to do but i am looking forward to it
3734786 in 2004 david ray griffin published his landmark book the new pearl harbor disturbing questions about the bush administration and 9 11 which became a founding text of the 9 11 truth movement presenting what was then the most thorough critique of the official story available as new developments occurred griffin continually brought the discussion up to date in his subsequent books now the new pearl harbor revisited synthesizes the most important points of these previous studies and includes griffins chapter by chapter commentary which updates that earlier discussion with everything that has come to light since including the most recent developments
3734787 our strategy to diversify cae geographically between civil and military markets and between products and services provides us with a level of stability and predictability
3734788 no company is immune to economic and market fluctuations but the majority of our revenue is now derived from military or recurring training revenue sources we remain positive about our long term opportunities we have continued to use our flexibility to make bolt on acquisitions to selectively expand our capabilities and enhance our market position
3734789 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3734790 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3734791 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3734792 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3734793 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3734794 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3734795 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3734798 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3734799 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact

3734806 we collect and send bags away to poor children with little school equipment and clothing each backpack goes on a long journey to africa and helps the children with education and at home the backpacks go by truck then travel to a big ship where they are then moved to malawi in the south east of africa the children each get one bag the bags have roughly the same amount of things inside to make it fair malawi is a very hot country with a lot of orphans the people have a low life expectancy and they are low on daily resources marys meals is an organisation that feeds over 37 000 children every day it encourages poor children to go to school we are hoping to get over 50 bags filled and we would be grateful if the local community could donate bags and small items like pens pencils paper sandals toothpaste towels rulers sharpeners and clothing
3734807 consisted of a 47 mile cycle from glencoe to taynuilt a 10 mile kayak along the length of loch etive and a 13 mile run up glen etive i took part for two reasons the first was to raise money for clic sargent caring for children with cancer i have raised about 750 so far if anyone would like to add to this they can do so online at www justgiving com fionajohnston4 the second reason was just to see if i could do it well i did along with 57 other solo competitors it took me 6 hours 7 mins finishing as 3rd female and in 8th place overall it was a fantastic experience with some highs and lows throughout the day i loved the cycle section even the hills the kayaking was hard but the loch was calm and the scenery quite beautiful the run was a killer all uphill and i shuffled the last three miles i dont think i could have gone another step might do it again next year though id like to thank sincerely all those who have sponsored me

3734826 how can i miss you if you never go away
3734827 neither don nor myself were into having a big church wedding we wanted to do things our own way not to please some distant relative we got married in a registry office in
3734828 im quite laidback so i took organising the wedding in my stride we were engaged for a little over two years but i only started planning it three months beforehand when you have to give notice to the state
3734829 once we met with the registrar i just took everything else on a week by week basis we have a big back garden so we got two large gazebo tents from
3734830 because we organised everything ourselves i always felt in control of the situation
3734831 i wasnt running around checking on hotels or worrying about whos doing what and whether it would go right on the day there was no mad panic and i think that makes a huge difference to your enjoyment of the day
3734832 our families and friends mucked in to make things less stressful as well for instance someone took charge of the barbecue on the day so i didnt have to do any cooking and because we didnt hire a professional photographer my partners brother took all the photos
3734833 my dress was ivory but thats about the only traditional thing about the wedding i bought it off the rack in
3734834 at the beginning we set out a budget of around e5 000 to cover the cost of the wedding
3734835 it was basically a big party where everyone knew one another and could relax and enjoy themselves
3734836 and while other couples will still be paying for their wedding 10 years down the line ours is paid for
3734837 we havent booked a honeymoon yet but i think that will be my next project
3734838 ive never been the type of person who envisaged having a big white wedding so i didnt get obsessed about my dress or perfecting every last detail down to the ribbons on the flowers and because i wasnt a high maintenance bride there actually wasnt much to do
3734839 from start to finish the whole wedding only took three months to organise
3734840 im a wedding photographer and a bridal hairdresser so i know the costs involved but the prices we were being quoted were ridiculous once you mention the word wedding the price suddenly triples
3734841 i picked a hotel within two days and got my dress in the
3734842 the dress was e160 but for me the biggest selling point of a second hand dress is that youre not worrying about it for the whole day or telling me not to come near you with red wine or any of that rubbish i went back a couple of days before the wedding and bought a vintage style veil too anyway i couldnt justify spending a couple of grand on a designer dress and had heard some horrible stories about women being laughed out of boutiques because theyre not a size 10 im 510
3734843 haroon and i got married in a registry office and had 45 guests at our reception some people think that a registry wedding means you cant have the dress or the bridesmaids but we had the whole shebang dresses hair make up vintage car flowers photos cake and reception
3734844 in the end i suppose i did have a big white wedding just without the big white wedding price tag we spent around e5 000 in total and came in a little under budget
3734845 my family and friends all got involved to help cut costs my uncle did the photography and my friend whos a videographer recorded everything another friend from the
3734846 the day before the wedding we were down in the hotel decorating the reception room and that morning when i was upstairs having my make up done my aunts were downstairs at the kitchen table putting the flowers together with material i had bought
3734847 nobodys going to know the difference between whether youve had your flowers shipped in from
3734848 i have friends whove put off getting married because they think they cant afford it but my own wedding showed me that its possible to have a dream wedding without remortgaging your house ive even set up a budget weddings business to cater for other couples like us
3734849 when i told my friends how much our wedding cost they were amazed that we still managed to have all the trimmings i didnt miss out on anything except the stress
3734850 americans have a right to know if a foreign government has any role when decisions are being made about the m1 tank missile systems or the development of oil and gas pipelines
3734851 we dont know enough about the exact nature of foreign involvement in these companies and the motives behind these arrangements
3734852 both of these plants pose a significant threat to air quality and contribute to the problem of global climate change
3734853 coal plants are the largest industrial source of mercury and will affect water quality throughout oklahoma and arkansas
3734854 banks should have to get their customers affirmative consent before signing them up for their most expensive loans
3734855 it is unfair for banks to make overdraft loans without consumer consent a firm contract to cover overdrafts notice that a transaction will trigger an overdraft fee and cost information on borrowing by overdraft
3734856 overdrafts are a type of credit and they are one of the most costly types imaginable
3734857 yet the banks that make these loans dont have to provide truth in lending disclosures which would inform consumers how expensive this form of credit really is
3734858 bankers claim that paying the largest check first helps consumers make sure that the mortgage or rent gets paid even if more transactions bounce or overdraw the account
3734859 only 13 percent of consumers in a national poll agreed with bankers most consumers want their banks to pay transactions smallest first or in the order they arrive at the bank

3734861 state approval would open the door for unistar to immediately start construction before the reactor design is fully scrutinized and licensed by the federal nuclear regulatory commission
3734862 the state has the first opportunity to keep electric ratepayers out of a financially dark hole before it becomes too difficult to stop digging
3734863 according to wall streets own assessment the ultimate cost of constructing a new reactor cannot even be imagined right now
3734864 the writing for this project is already on the wall with mounting cost overruns and repeated delays for epr pilot projects in finland and france
3734865 the scheduled completion of the finnish project has now slipped by two and a half years to 2011 with the projected cost of completion now at 8 1 billion a dramatic increase of 3 4 billion eventually schedule driven financial pressure erodes public safety with this inherently dangerous industry
3734866 marylanders can build a clean energy future for the region that doesnt result in radioactive waste piling up on the chesapeake bay
3734867 the public service commission should deny unistars certificate on the grounds that increasingly affordable renewable energy and efficiency technologies already under way can provide a cleaner safer and more stable electric system with superior economic benefits to the state
3734868 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3734869 of course they are entitled to take things from georgians now because they lost their own property in tskhinvali and other places
3734870 isnt that what they georgians have been doing to us these old people shouldnt be complaining they should be happy they werent killed
3734871 acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population
3734872 the russian government should be held to this promise to punish looters but much more needs to be done to ensure that all sides protect civilians
3734873 the georgians came to the village at around two oclock in the morning they told us not to be afraid and said that if our men wouldnt shoot they wouldnt shoot either they shot in the air probably trying to frighten us they entered the houses checked identification documents even took away the passports from some of our neighbors they also looked for young guys and for the men though all our males were already gone by then they joined the militia and hid themselves in the woods the georgians were also looking for firearms but our men had taken their weapons with them so there was nothing much to find we were very scared and could not stay in the village while the georgians were there so we also fled into the woods
3734874 tell your men not to open fire if they dont shoot we arent going to shoot either
3734875 this technique is a clean probe of the microscopics in this system and it allows us to see interesting things like a very large energy gap that seems to appear before the superfluid state
3734876 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack
3734877 to suggest that our nations most important wildlife law could be gutted after a mere 60 day written comment period is the height of arrogance and disrespect for wildlife science elected officials have been saying no to proposals like this for 15 years
3734878 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
3734879 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction
3734880 with these changes the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
3734881 this move is consistent with other efforts by the administration to cement industry friendly policies before leaving office in january
3734882 this could mean death by a thousand cuts for many threatened and endangered species
3734883 the creation of an arbitrary deadline could enable even the most harmful projects to escape endangered species act scrutiny
3734884 the bush administration has a long history of downplaying the role of science in its decisions
3734885 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3734886 the bush administration believes it can succeed now with this discredited agenda because the american people and congress are distracted by a presidential campaign and other pressing issues
3734887 we hope our champions in congress will call for a full review of this proposal and work to halt this stealth attack on americas most important wildlife law
3734888 this copii transport machinery is critical for the normal functioning of nearly one third of proteins encoded by the genome
3734889 so any structural anomaly or improper engagement of this coat machinery can result in a number of debilitating and chronic diseases finally understanding this structure opens the door to the possibility of developing advanced therapeutic solutions
3734890 before these findings the general consensus was that the transport machine basically ran constantly and that the protein cargo somehow got incorporated into it
3734891 but no one had actually ever seen the structure generated by the carragher and potter groups as an intact assembled coat our study suggests a new mechanism by which the cargo drives coat assembly for vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum
3734892 before our study looking at the transport machine was like looking at a pile of car parts you had all the parts but you couldnt tell what was going on or what would happen next now we have a fully assembled car we know the structure and we can finally begin working on it to see precisely how it functions
3734893 working with the carragher and potter groups we generated a 3 d model of a large icosidodecahedral cage structure a polyhedron with 12 pentagon shaped areas and 20 triangular shaped areas that contains the adaptor layer
3734894 as it turns out sections of the adaptor layer are assembled in an off center or asymmetric fashion which contributes significantly to the mechanism by which the cage lattice architecture is generated allowing a considerable flexibility that facilitates cage expansion
3734895 to construct the cage the adaptor complex has to preassemble but the only way it can do that asymmetrically is if the protein cargo is at the heart of the system
3734896 if the protein cargo has a problem a misfold for example it cant recruit the adaptor legitimately to drive cage assembly this is what happens in disease
3734897 the reality is that these mutations disconnect the protein cargo from the adaptor system
3734898 in misfolding diseases the mutation destabilizes the protein folding and the cargo cant carry out the assembly of the adaptor complex that tells us that theres a common basis for this adaptor complex that is crucial for every one of these diseases
3734899 this shows just how important assembling an adaptor cluster is and in these diseases we have a failure to drive this function
3734900 its not just misfolding other diseases face the same problem hence we have identified a critical common event in the life of a cell that contributes significantly to human health
3734901 right now were trying to understand exactly how it assembles
3734902 because this is a self assembling nano particle we believe there must be proteins that ultimately regulate the assembly
3734903 one year ago secretary bodman challenged the entire u s department of energy to meet or exceed the presidents goals for increasing energy efficiency decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy in the federal government
3734904 im proud to announce doe is delivering with alternative financing methods that reduce the need for federal spending
3734905 live level meters rotating cassette spindles live search and ui sound effects make tapedeck truly fun to use
3734906 our goal is to help make the iaff the first smoke free union
3734907 we congratulate the iaff for its commitment to this campaign and look forward to working together toward the goal of a smoke free union
3734908 fire fighters are respected leaders in their communities and this program on smoking cessation reaffirms that leadership
3734909 fire fighters place themselves in harms way confront dangerous environments high heat and flames and exposure to burning materials
3734910 its stressful work and some respond to stress by smoking yet smoking increases the health risks fire fighters face we want to help prevent that
3734911 our study suggests that even modest reductions in overall smoking rates may save lives in fact quitting smoking is the most important step smokers can take to improve their overall health and that of their loved ones people who do smoke should smoke outside the house to help protect themselves and their families from home fires and exposure to secondhand smoke a known human carcinogen
3734912 home fire deaths have declined during the past several decades and this decline has paralleled reductions in smoking
3734913 we work hard to keep our homes safe and it just makes good sense to help people understand that if they can change their smoking habits we may continue to reduce these tragedies
3734914 does commercial building initiative and the collaborative are urgently needed to accelerate innovation and market adoption in the field of high performance buildings
3734915 now we are bringing to bear the unprecedented collaboration in scientific resources of five national laboratories to bring about the needed transformation of the built environment lower our carbon footprint in buildings and accelerate commercial deployment of clean efficient building technologies
3734916 harnessing the natural and abundant power of the sun and cost effectively converting it into energy is an important component of our comprehensive strategy to commercialize and deploy advanced clean alternative technologies to enhance our energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
3734917 our investment in these grid integration projects will lay the groundwork for high levels of solar photovoltaic market penetration to help meet the presidents goal of making solar power cost competitive with conventional sources of electricity
3734918 the u s is now the worlds largest wind energy producer with wind development sparking job creation and economic opportunity in a troubled economy
3734919 but the current figures hide a dire reality the pipeline of investment for 2009 has been on hold for months with escalating risks and costs for the industry because of the uncertainty about the production tax credit at a time when unemployment is at a 4 year high and the economy needs every stimulus it can get a rapid extension of the credit should be on any economic priority list for congress
3734920 its clear that wind power is not only a major technology with which to fight climate change but also one of the most promising and dynamic economic engines we have today
3734921 the nation needs an ambitious plan to promote the deployment of wind and other renewable energy technologies and the urgent first step it must take is to rapidly extend the expiring renewable energy credits which are the primary incentive that the nation provides for these technologies today
3734922 russia has made clear in statement after statement that they would do everything they could to stop georgia from joining nato
3734923 under prime minister vladimir putin russia has attempted to reestablish itself as a major power in a way that challenges the u s and the west and they are attempting to frighten and dissuade former soviet states like georgia from moving out of the russian orbit and closer toward the west
3734924 they also use old arguments like the ones used in the 19th century to come to the defense of the balkan orthodox community to justify their actions in 2008
3734925 medvedev and putin will exploit any perceived western weakness to push natos influence back to keep georgia and ukraine away from nato and the european union
3734926 russias leadership wants to show a strong russia especially looking at the near abroad former soviet states surrounding russia and based upon the high revenues from oil and gas exports russia wants to exploit a situation wherein most european countries dependent on russian oil and gas prefer the politics of cooperation with russia rather than the politics of confrontation
3734927 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3734928 georgian forces razed ten south ossetian villages at once ran over elderly people and children with tanks and burnt civilians alive in their sheds
3734929 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
3734930 but people believe them because the media has bought into russian public relations that pr machine has paid millions of dollars in influence money in washington and in the european capitals
3734931 for months since the april nato summit the russians have repeatedly violated georgian airspace launched limited attacks and generally tried to provoke a large scale military confrontation
3734932 it was obvious what was going to happen but nobody in america and europe really believed it they just wanted to wish it away
3734933 there is a naivet in the west a belief that other people think and operate like the west this is the same response to what we see with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad threatening to nuke israel no one wants to believe it because it seems incomprehensible
3734934 if there is one lesson to be learned from history its that the leopard never changes his spots
3734935 firstenergy and the nrc deserve the blame not an engineer who was simply trying to do his job and keep the plant safe
3734936 republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that
3734937 there is a legal framework in this country wherein people gain title for what they produce and put into the market oil is no different than that the oil where it is now means nothing to taxpayers or anyone else they cant use it where it is we allow oil companies who have the expertise and the capability to go out and drill and make money doing it that is the very definition of the free enterprise system that has served us all for over 230 years if we somehow get the idea as the soviets and their politburo have done in the past that we can just make the collectivist argument as the speaker has done here then i promise you we are in for some very difficult days ahead
3734938 if they want to drill we have 68 million acres in the lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest
3734939 we want to drill where the oil is you dont go grocery shopping in the hardware store we know the oil is in alaska we know its in anwr its within 70 miles of the alaska pipeline so the infrastructure would be a minimum we are the only civilized nation that i know of that is not using its own natural resources for its energy why would we want to stay dependent on foreign oil why would we want to send hugo chavez 170 million per year god only knows what we send the saudis its just unbelievable its just that san francisco mentality that pelosi brings as the speaker of the house
3734940 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3734941 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like the opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe that congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give american people more access to american oil
3734942 i think shes starting to waver now because she knows an issue like this will hurt her majority she represents one of the most if not the most liberal district s in the country she is not conservative on any issue she probably reflects a significant number of people in her district but her responsibility is to represent the entire country as the speaker of the house i think thus far on energy she has failed in that responsibility
3734943 the problem with americans is they have an unfortunate habit of seeing the world through an american lens
3734944 he went on the television networks saying he had agreed with the south vietnamese on an orderly schedule for complete withdrawal of american forces from the war his speech was carried live on abc cbs and nbc
3734945 since he spoke longer than expected he spilled over into the networks next half hour time period since network time is always divided into blocks of half hours and hours this meant the network had to fill whatever part of the half hour nixon left
3734946 a few of our own correspondents and an outsider or two to discuss the speech the audience had just heard on this night following nixon i and a few others got the unpleasant duty to discuss his speech until the beginning of the next hour
3734947 i can remember nothing of it now and no transcript exists
3734948 nobody including us really liked filling time this way but no one knew any alternative how else on short notice or no notice could we fill network airtime organ music
3734949 more than half of the seats in the stadium will go to colorado residents
3734950 heard a blood curdling scream from my twelve year old who was swimming twenty feet away from me in a large salt water tidal pond what could possibly have happened
3734951 seconds before she was laughing and splashing with her friend now she was crying with a huge red welt on her leg
3734952 have just shown up around marthas vineyard and the cape like never seen before
3734953 back at the pond my daughters friend felt the effects of global warming herself not eight minutes later she cried too
3734954 and here is a thing that most of us fail to appreciate we are still in an ice age only now we experience it for just part of the year snow and ice and cold are not really typical features on earth taking the long view antarctica is actually a jungle its just having a chilly spell
3734955 at the very peak of the last ice age 20 000 years ago 30 percent of the earth was under ice
3734956 as it soaked up the earths free water sea levels fell by 450 feet
3734957 families in my district use heating oil to stave off winter cold and too many of them are already shivering were not even into the heating season yet and already prices in the hudson valley are over 70 percent more than last year
3734958 its been three years and i need to get back in here
3734959 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3734960 but getting people back into hard hit neighborhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3734961 people wont come back unless there are jobs for them while companies arent going to move here unless there are people to work for them
3734962 the worst affected are people in the lower income brackets who dont know how to navigate their way through the system where the rules seem to change from day to day
3734963 unfortunately this is a state program and i simply cant get rid of all the bureaucracy
3734964 but i can streamline the processes and tighten deadlines to make the program run faster
3734965 this will not be a city of half a million people again for a very long time the best way forward is to let go of the past and look to a different future
3734966 new orleans has all its eggs in one basket and we need to move away from that
3734967 we have to give people a reason to come here
3734968 if we show them the neighborhood is alive and we are pursuing a path of sustainable development that is a step in the right direction
3734969 if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels
3734970 i dont think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium 3
3734971 but over the long term we do face an energy problem
3734972 this reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering
3734973 helium 3 is present on the moon but in very small concentration levels meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium 3
3734974 our real challenge is not obtaining the helium 3 it is demonstrating that we can burn it
3734975 people believe media bias is a bigger problem even though 63 believe most politicians will break the rules to help campaign contributors
3734976 never has the disjuncture between coverage and reality loomed quite so large as it does in this race you get one image from the media and a totally different one from the polling
3734977 just 19 6 percent of those surveyed could say they believe all or most news media reporting this is down from 27 4 percent in 2003
3734978 nearly four in ten 37 say that in covering the democratic race news organizations have been biased toward obama while just 8 say they have been biased toward hillary clinton
3734979 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3734980 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
3734981 i felt it my duty to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
3734982 i do not espouse censorship of any kind but i do value my right to critique those who abuse the past without regard for its richness or resonance in the present
3734983 the georgian side could still maintain lower gas prices they could compensate for gas price by trading off some assets for example armenia had already paid gazprom with its transportation network

3734988 that fact that more consumers seem to be prepared to buy prescription drugs online than simple diy items like wallpaper and garden sheds is a worrying finding and pharmaceutical organisations must use the internet to advise consumers on the dangers of this
3734989 im scared you see i moved to nagoya about two weeks ago and that fact led me to remind of
3734990 i dont know if its as off the wall as an awful lot of stuff thats out there
3734991 ozawas stuff is so off the wall hardcore it makes you wonder if she owes the wrong people money
3734992 not so odd really some av actresses retire from porn before going legit while others like honoka and
3734993 we play in a 40 over league and we cant suddenly say its a twenty over match
3734994 our 40 overs were played out in the hope the other 40 overs were playable and sadly that has not been the case
3734995 its a weather induced issue its normally rain that brings these things to a conclusion
3734996 its not good for cricket i am very sympathetic its unprecedented and i hope its not something that will happen again
3734997 we had a fair idea that was going to happen its a shame as we were in a decent position at the time
3734998 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on
3734999 you just cannot continue to increase debts i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch
3735000 the owner has already invested an incredible amount of money but we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60m on players alone
3735001 on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially all that and with just 20 000 coming through the gates
3735002 people have to be realistic a few players might arrive but not for big money we have still got more quality players than we have ever seen at pompey

3735070 high silver recoveries will be extremely important at cerro moro as drilling results to date suggest that silver may contribute some 40 of revenue from potential production from the gold rich escondida vein where silver gold ratios appear to increase with depth a trend that may be similar at other gold rich veins
3735071 the ability to recover 90 of both the gold and silver will have a very positive impact on the economics of the project particularly with silver potentially comprising 80 of the future metal value in some veins such as gabriela
3735072 these new results suggest that the selected flowsheet will be effective in dealing with the different high grade zones and the variable styles of mineralization found at cerro moro

3735092 het is hard talk and straight talk ik heb ministers gehad die van public relations zei in de pauze ik ga weg maar wij zeiden dat is nog slechter dan te blijven
3735093 ik wist niet eens dat er negen politieke partijen zijn politiek is iets heel normaals maar hier is dat iets nieuws tijdens een persconferentie van de president zei een journalist dat hij had gehoord dat er politieke partijen aan het infiltreren zijn wat in nederland en belgi zo populair is je oor te luisteren leggen bij de burgers wordt hier over het algemeen ervaren als infiltratie kagame zei dan ook maar zij doen gewoon hun werk

3735350 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3735351 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

3735355 belangrijke update die ik moest installeren voor het invoeren van de activatiecode
3735356 more and more people are coming to understand that our actions have consequences for the natural world around us and theyre wondering how they can reduce their impact on the planet
3735357 many of these grants will be used to give young students hands on lessons and conduct workshops for teachers on such critical issues as renewable energy climate change water conservation air quality and acid mine drainage helping students and the public understand issues like these is the first step in finding solutions to our most pressing environmental challenges
3735358 he who does not prevent a crime when he can encourages it
3735359 crime stoppers pays up to 5 000 for information called in to the 713 222 8477 tips hotline that leads to the identification arrest and charging of any felony suspects and we are pleased that embarq is sweetening the reward
3735360 their additional reward takes our efforts to a higher level it is our hope that those who would steal copper will think twice and those who would normally look the other way will become more actively involved in protecting the community
3735361 when people steal cable it puts the entire community at risk
3735362 cutting cable can cut emergency communications which affects everyone imagine having a loved one suddenly in need of emergency medical assistance only to find communications services dont work because someone just cut the cable to steal the copper this is a threat to everyone
3735363 takedas goal is to help create a safe and vibrant learning environment for the students of thomas jefferson middle school
3735364 takeda is committed to supporting our communities and for the past six years our employees have demonstrated this through their participation in our annual community outreach day what were able to give the students of thomas jefferson middle school today is a testament not only to takedas corporate philosophy but also to the great takeda employees who make this day possible
3735365 takeda has been a pleasure to work with over the past six years and we look forward to future community improvement efforts we can collaborate on
3735366 when the 860 thomas jefferson middle school students return this fall we know they will be excited to see the fresh new look to their school
3735367 we are pleased that iplogic inc has again met all requirements to achieve this gold recertification
3735368 based on our outstanding performance in personnel support specialization and customer satisfaction iplogic has reaffirmed our qualifications to sell install and support cisco solutions in the usa
3735369 we are committed to providing the tools training and programs that help drive partner growth differentiation and profitability
3735370 with specializations in unified communications routing and switching security and wireless lan iplogic has made an investment in developing the capability to deliver the integrated and customized technology solutions todays customers demand
3735371 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3735372 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3735373 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3735374 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3735375 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3735376 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3735377 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3735378 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3735379 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3735380 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3735381 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3735382 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3735383 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3735384 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3735385 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3735386 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3735387 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3735388 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3735389 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3735390 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3735391 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3735392 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3735393 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3735394 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3735395 the ndfeb material which is the magnetic material in the neocube
3735396 our advertising revenue results continued to be affected by the weak economy and the secular trends impacting our industry
3735397 during the quarter our print advertising revenue was down 19
3735398 our cost structure benefited from a 9 reduction in head count with salaries and wages down 2 0 million or 7 6 in addition our second largest expense category newsprint was up slightly with a 27 6 increase in the average cost per ton being offset by reduced consumption
3735399 upon seeing a 550 gallon okeanos aquarium in a fellow hobbyists home in south jersey i knew i had to have my dream aquarium built into my new home
3735400 over the past 20 years ive owned many aquariums and exotic aquatic life and i was amazed when i saw this gentlemans tank how beautiful it was and how he was successfully housing hard to keep coral and fish to have my aquarium built my architect had to add steel support throughout the floor where my aquarium is the architect also added extra power for the custom built filtration system which is housed underneath the aquarium at approximately 300 sq ft and for the 4 000 watts of specialty aquarium lighting in addition fans were added to the top of the aquarium which exhaust through the side of the house for proper ventilation and a dedicated drain was installed for water changes its all worth it just to have my dream fulfilled and to enjoy my very own slice of the ocean every day
3735401 were so excited to have completed this project as its the largest glass reef aquarium in a private residence in new york city
3735402 we built everything on site since it was too large to carry into the house weve built a clients dream and given him everything he ever wanted in an aquarium everything we did was carefully planned and executed to perfection
3735403 im delighted to announce that with the help of planned parenthood my blog for the first time received more visits than my teenage sons myspace page perhaps ill address the subject of physician conscience one more time
3735404 obviously some disagree with the federal law and would have it otherwise so they have begun using the accreditation standards of physician professional organizations to define the exercise of conscience unprofessional and thereby make doctors choose between their capacity to practice in good standing and their right of conscience
3735405 clear effort to subvert the law in favor of ideology
3735406 this is not a discussion about the rights of a woman to get an abortion this is about the right of a doctor to not participate if he or she chooses for reasons they consider a matter of conscience
3735407 it is currently a violation of three separate federal laws to compel medical practitioners to perform a procedure that violates their conscience
3735408 since you are such an old hand at the abortion wars then surely you are well aware of the anti choice tactic of defining abortion down the medically dubious assertion that pregnancy occurs before implantation a great deal of the outrage over this proposed regulation centers on the potential of your department legitimizing this view under the guise of protecting conscience thus putting not only access to abortion but access to necessary birth control in jeopardy and nothing you have said so far contradicts that
3735409 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
3735410 dont federal laws already protect doctors rights to opt out of performing abortions where is this serious need that leavitt stresses this seems more like a ploy to shift the focus from the medical issue of access to contraception to a theoretical abstract notion of the rights of man and citizen leavitts hoping to come across more like a modern day enlightenment philosophe than an anti choice bush appointee it aint working
3735411 ive got four kids and one on the way im the coach in that house if im not setting a good example then im failing as a father thats the last thing id want to do is fail my kids
3735412 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3735413 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3735414 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3735415 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3735416 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3735417 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3735418 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3735419 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3735420 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3735421 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3735422 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3735423 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3735424 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3735425 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3735426 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3735427 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3735428 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3735429 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3735430 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3735431 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3735432 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3735433 the acquisition of these quality facilities expands first industrials presence in the seattle market
3735434 the properties also complement our development investments in the region at first park meridian campus and first park northwest landing by establishing our position in the important kent valley submarket
3735435 it is important that there are resources available to those who will encounter problems when they register or attempt to cast their ballot
3735436 all those who wish to vote should be aware of their registration status and their rights at the polling place so they can cast a secure ballot and have it count these are issues of both accountability and fairness
3735437 with 1 866 our vote were providing a much needed resource
3735438 there is a growing concern that many election administrators wont have the resources or the systems to handle the record influx of new registrations and voters arriving at the polls on election day election protection is equipped to help voters across the country especially in places where significant problems have occurred with voter registration or with casting a ballot
3735439 our noise blackout technology is a completely new and proprietary technology that not only allows crystal clear sound but eliminates the tinny sound that many noise cancellation headsets are plagued with
3735440 the first of many products in the jabra line to feature this technology the bt530 also features a2dp for streaming music and multiuse r functionality
3735441 our quyana members past guests asked us to add new destinations and cruise west listened by delivering four new distinctive itineraries and reintroducing vietnam in 2009
3735442 i personally scouted the galapagos itinerary and the danube river cruise in honor of cruise wests first european river cruise i will host a chairmans cruise on the first departure as with all cruise west voyages these new itineraries will offer guests the hallmark cruise west adventure an authentic experience
3735443 there is a big theme of unification that has been picking up steam in the security industry as companies are looking for ways to secure their networks with less equipment
3735444 nitrosecurity has had tremendous success addressing this theme and in generating momentum in the market strong partnerships key strategic acquisitions a growing roster of global customers and increased adoption in a variety of verticals such as higher education and the government sector prove that the company is poised for continued success
3735445 this round of funding will allow us to continue to innovate our suite of it security solutions to include next generation siem functions like predictive event correlation and deeper event to flow forensics
3735446 in addition to further product development we will also be expanding our global channel program to extend our reach into the mid market
3735447 all plan types posted negative results for q2 though the returns are a marked improvement over the first quarter
3735448 equity returns were down again this quarter but in contrast to previous quarters non us fixed income was the worst performing asset class losing more than 3
3735449 over the longer periods equities have clearly underperformed down over 10 year to date with bonds just in the black thus we continue to see fund types with greater equity allocations do relatively worse than those that underweight equity and overweight fixed income
3735450 we knew we had the manpower to complete this project but we needed a partner to guide us through from start to finish
3735451 we were seeking a partner with a great deal of experience with sap solutions who could steer us toward best practices and help us avoid pitfalls cibers experienced resources and strong implementation records were what convinced us that ciber could help us accomplish more in a limited timeframe than our resources alone
3735452 the team of experts from ciber sap and omnitrans will help omnitrans make the best use of its time money and personnel resources to deliver financial returns from this it investment
3735453 the sap solution will provide omnitrans with the scope of functionality it needs right now while accommodating the organizations future growth in the end the solution will provide the features and flexibility omnitrans needs along with a very reasonable total cost of ownership
3735454 this is a big initiative but its benefits for omnitrans will be numerous and far reaching
3735455 by implementing sap and therefore upgrading its financial human resources and materials management applications omnitrans can significantly increase its operational efficiencies which translates into reduced costs and greater services to its constituents were very pleased to be chosen to help omnitrans achieve these goals
3735456 as the slow down in demand for our electrical construction services and the depression in the florida real estate market continue we have been aggressively pursuing expanding the geographic footprint of our electrical construction business outside of our historical operating region as previously announced we have been awarded projects in central colorado and northern texas and although we are still in the initial phase of this expansion i am encouraged by our success and look forward to these new projects making a positive contribution to our results in the coming quarters
3735457 with respect to our real estate development operations notwithstanding the current depression in the florida real estate market i believe that our exposure is very manageable as we do not currently have any projects under construction and our latest project pineapple house is complete and has been well received
3735458 our focus is maintaining a clearance around those conductors so the transmission lines can be operated safely to their design capabilities
3735459 were not concerned about health of the trees or aesthetics

3735472 attempts to commence negotiations over the past several months have been unsuccessful
3735473 try again draw a long breath and shut your eyes
3735474 when i was your age i always did it for half an hour a day why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
3735475 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
3735476 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users
3735477 this is likely to create quality of data and privacy issues
3735478 creemos que estos problemas son t picos de un chipset y una pila de protocolos de radio inmaduros y estamos casi seguros de que infineon es el responsable de estos chips

3735481 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3735482 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3735483 obviously meant a lot to saakashvili personally but more importantly the message it conveyed to the georgian people in this really time of unprecedented national emergency
3735484 we should realize what is at stake here for americans
3735485 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3735486 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3735487 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3735488 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3735489 a blog owner who continuously maliciously and contumeliously went on a rampage to defame me
3735490 i have not seen anything more defamatory than what this man has written none of what he said is true
3735491 i have no proof i know one baby is missing her tooth but i have no proof but i dont think for sure all the countries are going by the rules
3735492 if you think our girls are little because of looks then maybe you should think the europeans and americans are strong because of doping
3735493 i am delighted that the independent audit confirmed the growth and profitability of the two mines acquired by l amp l earlier this year
3735494 china has little petroleum thus 71 of chinas energy is supplied by coal our acquisition of these two mines will have an immediate effect on sales and net income starting may 1 2008 using established relationship l amp l plans to acquire additional equity ownership of these two mines in order to show added profits in addition another acquisition is in process
3735495 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3735496 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3735497 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure

3735502 congratulations on being the recipient of the 2008 service to seniors by an organization
3735503 the west palm beach housing authority was selected from among all nominations received for outstanding service to older persons
3735504 although the agency does not have service to older adults in florida as its primary focus the exemplary efforts of wpbhas elder care amp crisis manager assisted by one elderly services coordinator and one volunteer personify a record of excellence in work on behalf of senior floridians these are individuals who rise above their daily duties with a passion and creativity to unselfishly serve the needs of a vital part of the community its senior population
3735505 if i could only get an interview i know id get the job
3735506 deber an haber esperado un poco m s antes de tomar esta decisi n
3735507 si quer an un xito mundial los tengo todos aqu dentro
3735508 supongo que quer an algo bien definido y aburrido cuando saque mi versi n y estoy tentada de hacerlo el mismo d a ser un xito
3735509 i am not commenting on that issue as i made clear at the outset it is not about that
3735510 an analysis of the results has shown that students who take more rigorous math and science courses score much higher on the act than those who do not
3735511 with the economy being the way it is we hear a lot about increases i want the citizens to know that just because staff throws an increase at us we consider it
3735512 theres no water usage but a monthly fee for their share of costs of running the system
3735513 it needs to become expensive so you dont use a lot its trying to encourage people to water smarter
3735514 what makes this odd is that the water was crystal clear
3735515 and it wasnt near the jetty like most of our shark attacks
3735516 thats how a shark views the world by biting he may have just bumped into her leg
3735517 we will do it on a case by case basis
3735518 civilian employees do not need to be in harms way in collecting money for tickets
3735519 it is not worth getting hurt over some parking tickets
3735520 hes overman more looking at how the city ordinance can be judiciously applied
3735521 he just wants to make sure it is an appropriate measure to collect a payment
3735522 this fire was very dangerous for firefighters because the fire was already in the attic when we arrived so we had to fight it offensively from the outside
3735523 its a lot easier to ask questions than find solutions
3735524 the fact is florida is a diverse state that is becoming even more diverse we know that most of these health disparities are prevalent
3735525 but when you look at a poor less educated population the mortality rates are higher
3735526 many of the chronic diseases that we have found in the community can be prevented or controlled with more health education
3735527 we have to start giving people the tools and we havent been doing it
3735528 it was holding me to the ground and it pushed my teeth into the rock and then my dad pulled him off i ran again tripped and then it jumped on me again
3735529 i think he realized it could have been less than that
3735530 god saved my life so i can talk to young people about underage drinking and driving
3735531 because its what almost killed me and it put me in this wheel chair
3735532 im hoping with this ride in each state i go through i can bring attention
3735533 we need stiffer laws and need to be stricter on underage drinking and driving
3735534 the ruling leaves it wide open for anybody to challenge whats going to happen
3735535 if it doesnt pass then the matter resolves itself but until that point we are somewhat in limbo
3735536 a private burial service for our children ben and catherine was held earlier today
3735537 it was our wish that the burial was held in private and we thank the media for respecting our privacy
3735538 we are currently making plans together for a funeral service which will allow extended family members friends and colleagues of ben and catherine to pay their respects
3735539 it is the families intention for the media to be facilitated at this service details of which will be confirmed in due course
3735540 in the meantime the media are asked to continue to respect our wishes to be able to grieve in private and to try and come to terms with the terrible events of the past few weeks
3735541 these rich super premium brownies are baked by the brownie artisans at greyston bakery suppliers to ben amp jerrys
3735542 the haemorrhage did massive damage to his body which would have left him severely disabled and in need of acute care for the rest of his life we know jerry wouldnt want to live like this in a vegetative state
3735543 too many students are graduating high school without the skills needed to succeed in college
3735544 they had to dodge mother natures elements but it isnt usual to have perfect conditions the rowers faced less then ideal conditions but all made it back safe

3735570 the problem is basically new york has spoken against the death penalty with the exception of a situation involving a cop killing
3735571 yet you go on and on and on and prosecute these cases
3735572 its just not cost effective to willy nilly strive for the death penalty
3735573 it really goes a long way toward hurting the functions of the court and the u s attorneys office in terms to being able to handle the rest of their criminal docket it creates a serious problem
3735574 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3735575 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3735576 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3735577 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3735578 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3735579 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3735581 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3735582 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3735583 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3735584 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3735585 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3735586 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3735587 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3735599 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3735600 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another

3735616 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3735617 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3735618 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september

3735683 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3735684 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
3735685 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology
3735686 a car can be a tremendous convenience and even a necessity in many u s communities
3735687 but it also can be another cause of financial problems for individuals who live on a tight budget being a smart consumer can help you make a better vehicle choice and prepare for a better financial outlook
3735688 if your car has lost value quickly or if you have had a new car for less than a year the loan amount on your car may be more than its trade in value meaning you would you could be facing a big chunk of debt added to a new car loan
3735689 with the right planning and consideration the choices you make will not drive a car sized hole right through your budget

3735693 ive got friends here who have just been lifelong friends people who have seen me through thick and thin in tough times and in good times
3735694 there are a lot of people who have done everything right and yet are still coming up short

3735699 shes one of the women who really pushed the boundaries
3735700 but all they would do is laugh when i asked

3735706 the neuse river basin is one of the fastest growing river basins in the nation increasing population growth combined with poor land use practices will continue to degrade our water resources local governments need to implement strong stormwater programs and strictly enforce sedimentation pollution control laws to control runoff from construction activity
3735707 if i jump a personal best and that makes it to the final ill be very happy
3735708 i had a solid indoor season but since then ive struggled with a few injuries but im in good shape so its up to me to go and do what i can do
3735709 im going to tell them i think they are the heartland of america that the values they hold dear are the strength and character of america
3735710 theyre the reason why the people in georgia today are looking to america a beacon of hope and liberty
3735711 we waited and thought well it might take a few weeks
3735712 were powerless to do anything which is the worst thing about it
3735713 because of the prevailing market conditions we have been taking action in reviewing our build activity
3735714 i dont think anyone will reach that in the next one to two years and when someone does i will create more records
3735715 i would like to take some rest the continuous training certainly has taken its toll and i feel rather exhausted

3735730 veel mensen in nederland weten nauwelijks wat daar gebeurd is in aanvang waren het geen vernietigingskampen maar door uithongering uitputting en ziektes werden de meeste kampen dat uiteindelijk wel
3735731 de nachten waren vreselijk ze zijn voor mij nog steeds een bezoeking
3735732 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3735733 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3735734 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3735735 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3735736 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3735737 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3735738 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3735739 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3735740 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3735741 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3735742 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3735743 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3735744 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3735745 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3735746 i would sincerely hope that the italian parliament would pass this law
3735747 we athletes go through major sacrifices to get to this level it would be the right thing to do to remove the taxes from what we get here it would be a very good thing
3735748 but because of the overwhelming size of the collection and the complex and time consuming nature of provenance investigations we decided the best and most expeditious course of action was to publicize the art work to the general public
3735749 the premises are occupied and controlled by the defendant sunrise propane energy group inc
3735750 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won
3735751 i didnt expect this medal my coach told me that even eighth place would be okay
3735752 other swimmers have endurance but my advantage is speed i gave it all that i had hopefully the bronze medal will encourage our team
3735753 my life is pretty much packed into my racquet bag

3735758 emergents are multiplying and for most of those participating in the movement this multiplicity is not perceived as a challenge but as an opportunity for forging transversal differentiated networks oriented by and toward reformative communion that empowers persons to share in the self giving love of jesus way of acting in the world isnt this what church should be

3735806 we had it out in our year end meeting i didnt like the direction it was going and he had to be part of the solution or the problem
3735807 he always was a guy that had talent and always teased you a little bit youd see it but never on a consistent basis his work ethic wasnt at a level it needed to be consistently the type of player he envisioned himself being and the type of player i knew he needed to be were different hes a physical guy with a hard shot but he wasnt always willing to go those parts of the ice
3735808 i think the biggest thing was he matured and realized how much work you have to put in
3735809 the clich the light finally went on suits his year and how things went
3735810 i took things on my shoulders this year for our team i led our team in goals this year that was a key i wanted to be one of our offensive guys be one of our go to guys and i think i did that
3735811 they were two guys that knew i was going to rely on them for leadership and they knew they had to walk the walk if they were going to talk it
3735812 it was great for our young kids to see dale took a step on the ice but he also took a step off the ice
3735813 ive watched him a lot seen him over the years and i did a lot of research
3735814 dale went from a kid that probably when he first came in things didnt work out that well when he came in at 17 to a kid that when it wasnt going that well it was im not playing with the right guys all the wrong excuses instead of i have to do something myself he went through the draft was like woe is me whats going on you wait to see what happens then it finally kicked in he said i have to do something about it and dean said he came at the beginning of the year a different person right from the outset
3735815 the biggest thing is im just trying to show them what im about
3735816 im a good kid i dont have any off ice issues im a hard worker i come to work every day with the idea that im going to work as hard as i can to get better where they feel is the best for me is what im going to do if i have to go back to junior for another year ill be happy i had a good three years in swift current if they decide im ready for pro ill be ecstatic thats my goal i want to earn a pro spot and make it hard on them
3735817 probably my favorite player growing up was the winnipeg jet keith tkachuk
3735818 i love the way he plays physical guy he scored goals he was out in front he fought he did it all
3735819 hes got to continue what he started at the beginning of last year
3735820 this guy killed penalties played on the power play played five on five this guy played everything skates hits he shoots hes the type of player we certainly need more of in the rangers organization
3735821 when i was chosen in the seventh round that was the best day of my life
3735822 i didnt even look at it as something that was going to hurt me or something that was going to help me i never really had any trouble motivating myself to play hockey so its been easy for me to come to the rink and work hard
3735823 ill have fun and joke around at the right times but ill also bear down at the right times in practice for me being snatched up in the later rounds and becoming part of an organization gave me sort of an objective and something to work toward
3735824 every summer ive entered developmental camp knowing the coaching staff knows me and has seen my progress i want to be a washington capital and am now looking forward to the next two years of my contract and hopefully more after that
3735825 everything has happened so fast this year and honestly the nhl draft hadnt crossed my mind at all until around thanksgiving
3735826 it was then that teams started calling and there were people at every game toward the end of the season and during the playoffs so it started to become a little bit more real for me and something i began to focus on a little more during my teams run in the playoffs
3735827 the ejhl may not have the competition of other leagues but it gave me the chance as a young guy to play in situations that other 16 year old players in other leagues probably didnt have
3735828 i played in a pretty good organization with some good coaching and had a chance to live at home and finish out high school which was a plus for me but now i know its time to move on
3735829 when i entered new hampshire i had a good amount of skill but i wasnt seeing or taking the game the way the coaches wanted me to so i was helped in the power play in the neutral zone and especially in my defensive zone i never was a defensive minded guy so those were the areas in which i really improved
3735830 the biggest transition i made was in my third year when i started playing a totally different style that i feel enabled me to earn that contract with the caps
3735831 the coaching staff wanted me to play more of a physical role getting in on the forecheck and using my body to create offense getting into the corners making those small plays and reaching the slot really helped elevate my game the last few years
3735832 the collegiate game is so tight checking there are many systems that you need to pay special attention to and you have to know who youre up against every shift of every game i attended so many video sessions and took part in one on one conversations with coaches and that helped change my style to a pro like type game
3735833 its a chance to play with good players in the middle of the summer and get to see some faces get to know the coaches and for the most part have some fun
3735834 lets face it no one is trying to win a roster spot in july and ive never considered camp a pressure situation its fun to come out and work hard in front of all these scouts coaches and gms in the organization and just let them know you are working hard
3735835 i really want to see how the program works and while i would like to leave an impression realize its not pressing at this point
3735836 but we all know first impressions are important so i hope to make a good one
3735837 we felt that we needed to take a real good look at anybody that has a chance to be in the top two lines someday
3735838 we felt we have a lot of defensemen that are good stay back defense so we needed to get somebody who could play in the top two lines as a forward and maybe somebody who could be a top four defenseman a puck mover thats the way the game is going these days
3735839 thats when hes out there playing against the guys from canada the u s sweden finland that someday youre going to be playing against in the national hockey league he stays at the top of that level when hes at those things
3735840 it the russian league is not as physical as our hockey over here but its very skilled
3735841 its a fast moving very skilled league and he manages to continue scoring points in it
3735842 he made the commitment to come over he told us when we drafted him hed come over in a year and he was here in a year hes followed through with everything he said
3735843 right from the very beginning he was by far one of the players who already knew how to play in his own defensive end which is very uncommon for young boys to know how to do
3735844 we usually have to teach them once they become pros but he already knew all that stuff
3735845 he just needs to learn the hitting part of the game being hit and taking guys out
3735846 hes going to be one of the guys challenging in camp for a position
3735847 hes a guy that just continuously from college maine made strides and hes made strides his first year as a pro to his second year he had a great year
3735848 in his whole game the only thing thats lacking is that theyre all bigger and stronger at the nhl level
3735849 its more of a game where you really have to take the guy out hes got the speed and size he just has to forecheck and take the man out and cause turnovers
3735850 hes got a chance with his skating and his shot with the way he showed us he could score this year the second line isnt out of the question
3735851 maybe we thought there was a little more outright offense in his game but hes settling in as a guy thats good on both sides of the puck
3735852 hes got speed and energy he can break it open with his speed and drive the net and then hes very solid defensively he knows how to play that role you cant play in the nhl unless you know that part of it
3735853 the good thing about korpikoski is hes played every forward position right wing center left wing
3735854 he is a kid that we think has a lot of natural skill
3735855 a quick set of hands and nice combination of speed and creativity with the puck hes a slight kid right now but hes got lots of room to put on weight the bottom line is he is fast and skilled
3735856 evgeny is a power forward with a good physical presence and ability to come up with the puck in traffic areas
3735857 he displays strong puck skills and the ability to make plays all over the ice but needs to improve his acceleration and overall speed
3735858 evgeny is a power forward with a good physical presence and ability to come up with the puck in traffic areas he displays strong puck skills and the ability to make plays all over the ice but needs to improve his acceleration and overall speed
3735859 at the world under 18 tournament i thought he was really good
3735860 any time you see a guy that big who does the things that he does in terms of handling the puck its an attractive package we felt we had to take him
3735861 we feel confident after talking to him that he really wants to come over to north america
3735862 hes a big big kid with a nice set of hands and very strong over the puck and is a good skater so hes got an excellent combination of size skating and skill
3735863 every year theres somebody whos somewhat of a late bloomer and hes one of them
3735864 he just kept developing this year and i think that every team is looking for size and a guy whos got a bit of a mean streak and some aggression to him and can play thats what this guy has to offer
3735865 ive watched him a lot seen him over the years and i did a lot of research
3735866 he looks like he can play in the american league right now
3735867 doyle has a very good skill set to him and a nice soft set of hands
3735868 from the top of the circles down he sees the net really well and hes pretty dangerous hes a good skater and a guy that we drafted for his overall skills and skating
3735869 theres still a few things hes got to work on
3735870 the defensive part of his game has come a long way
3735871 were looking for somebody to be a first power play guy
3735872 if it doesnt work out with the rangers he goes down and hes going to be playing a ton down in hartford its a good stepping stone for him from junior hell get a little more work on playing defense in the pro game but not at the expense of his offense we want him to take his offense to another level
3735873 i would have been able to tell you a lot more but he had that bad knee injury at the end of the year just when it was critical
3735874 just when it was coming to a level that it was getting interesting he got injured and missed the very important part of the schedule when its the playoffs and its do or die and you want to see how a guy plays
3735875 as soon as hes able to go hell get back to playing that strong defensive game
3735876 we had held this guy in really high regard as far as how high he could go
3735877 we think that he belonged in that upper echelon with some of the other defensemen that went higher so overall we were absolutely thrilled that he was still there
3735878 we feel michael thinks the game very well in his own zone and we think hes a pretty well rounded kid who has done a lot of good things with the puck this year
3735879 last year he kundratek played on the czech world junior team as a draft eligible guy which is a bit of a rarity and a big compliment
3735880 hes a guy who is nowhere near done growing hes going to be at least a 6 foot 3 200 pound plus guy hes a good skater has very good poise with the puck and really reads the ice well as far as passing the puck out of his own zone
3735881 unfortunately hes had some elbow problems and he basically missed the whole season but we had already seen him as an under ager and in just a handful of games this year
3735882 the background on him is that he has an excellent upside and unfortunately the injuries just put him back hes a big strong kid that skates well and has a good shot and competes were hoping he can get healthy and well suddenly have a real diamond in the rough
3735883 antoine moves very well for a big guy especially up and down
3735884 he times his butterfly style well knows his angles and how to play shots that he is screened on
3735885 social media has enabled me to feel ahead not behind as i return to work after 2nd baby

3735957 ongoing work on a vaccine against the barbers pole worm is promising and could lead to the development of vaccines against a range of worms
3735958 although it is one of the most important parasites of sheep in the southern hemisphere there are signs of increasing prevalence in the uk and it is thought this is in line with rising global temperatures
3735959 hopefully a vaccine will be in place before this worm becomes a real problem in the uk
3735960 and by using this parasite as a pathfinder we will be able to use this model to adapt to other parasites such as ostertagia in cattle
3735961 and with rising temperatures extending the parasite season control is needed now
3735962 we need to slow the process of resistance and this can be done by not exposing worms to anthelmintics and treating all animals of a class in a flock however when we have a means of identifying animals requiring treatment then we could use a targeted selected treatment approach
3735963 electronic ear tags and automated shedding systems would mean large numbers of sheep could be handled with minimal labour input
3735964 moredun is currently developing a model which predicts what weight lambs should be at a certain point in time and using this system could also calculate the efficiency of production preliminary tests show weight is an important indictor of worm infection however an issue requiring further research is how often animals needs weighing
3735965 the abnormal form of the prion protein prp causing scrapie is detected in nervous and lymph glands the protein also accumulates in the recto anal mucosal associated lymphoid tissue ramalt which is more easily accessed using a rectum speculum
3735966 the rectum speculum inserted up the anus exposes crypts where the abnormal prion protein is found forceps are then used to cut the crypt off this part of the procedure is quick the hardest part is catching the sheep and holding them in place on the bale
3735967 many more animals are infected with jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus jsrv than will develop the disease and some of the carriers will never get sick it is thought the disease is transmitted by lung fluid which contains 50m particles of jsrv a teaspoonful of lung fluid respiratory route and also milk could be important transmissions routes
3735968 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3735969 the sample for this study was a low income population
3735970 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3735971 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3735972 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3735973 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
3735974 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
3735975 youre on your own everything you do in a meritocratic society is some kind of test and there is never a final exam
3735976 why have we not telecast the story so far quite simply we have chosen not to telecast the story yet
3735977 this particular episode could have been released immediately and if it was not released immediately on legal advice then i believe it should have awaited the results of the parliament committees investigation

3736015 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbi s first century
3736016 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3736017 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3736018 more straight couples including support for gays in wedding plans
3736019 i thought it was really really beautiful and very healing
3736020 it brought tears to my eyes thinking that i am legally entitled to marry this wonderful couple but i am not entitled to have the same joy in my own life
3736021 gay friends rang to tell me about it they were horrified and really annoyed we all felt it was so wrong to grab all the benefits that marriage gives you and just make a little statement to calm your guilt
3736022 the conditions for free and fair elections start long before election day
3736023 but less than a month before elections its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
3736024 angolans need to see improvements now if septembers poll is to have a chance of meeting the basic requirements of a free election
3736025 the police arrived and took four aggressors and three injured victims with them for interrogation but afterwards released all of them
3736026 traditional authorities have to do now what the mpla says not all do this willingly but he who resists loses his bread
3736027 if we say the truth we are accused of being on the side of unita
3736028 the government should allow voters and opposition parties in cabinda to express their opinions freely if they are to have confidence in the electoral process
3736029 it is essential that all journalists are allowed to operate freely
3736030 all politically motivated charges and other threats against journalists or media outlets should be withdrawn to allow them to do their job without official hindrance
3736031 the central voter register seems to be property of the cipe and the government
3736032 involving civil society in observing the elections for the first time is a major new step for angola and its vital to enhance trust in the process
3736033 the electoral commission should respect recommendations and complaints from domestic observers it should also encourage civil society groups to observe the polls and get involved in voter education
3736034 election observers should remain vigilant about procedural flaws but should also monitor freedom of expression and intimidation of opposition activists
3736035 the observers should issue urgent statements about any problems they find so that they can be corrected before the voting begins
3736036 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3736037 and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone ive spent more time with sen john mccain he did my tv show then i have with sen obama i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support sen obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me

3736043 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3736044 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3736045 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3736046 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3736047 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3736090 shes a beautiful beautiful beautiful person in a very ugly position and i really feel for her
3736091 i think that i really have never known someone so insistent upon integrity and honesty and openness
3736092 but someone who has an affair with a married man you say has integrity and honesty
3736093 i think she thought that he had quite a bit of integrity and i think that that appealed to her about him sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we pick people to fall in love with that maybe arent the greatest choice at the time i cant judge her in that i cant fault her in that
3736094 a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue
3736095 we lost touch in about may or june of 06 right before she began work on the webisodes i think she was gearing up to really engage in the big piece of work that she was doing for him so her head was in a different space

3736101 after you get older you want to prove more things to yourself mentally and physically you want to stay younger so you push the envelope
3736102 but for most of them its a life experience in a sports venue
3736103 its all about what i can do not about anybody else
3736104 pretty cool ive had people say i am an inspiration to them
3736105 i carried that across the finish line anything is possible

3736107 potential for future support of the orchestra not only with this concert but at other potential sites around philadelphia

3736109 lets see how long it takes jenny to realize i sent the text message to someone else and not her boy is it pathetic how frequently she keeps looking at her phone and waiting
3736110 any wine they dont drink in paw paw michigan they send up here because the indians will drink anything
3736111 shes managed to come up with a fragrance thats quite delightful
3736112 i used to love to watch my grandmother put on her perfume
3736113 shed blot a little dab behind her ears it was such a classy ritual
3736114 these fragrances are more than doubling in volume while the market is declining
3736115 they are doing a good job at attracting the trendsetter customer who is looking to try out different things
3736116 there is a real passionate person out there who buys a lot of fragrances and knows when everything is out before it actually comes out
3736117 i have an overly sensitive nose and i dont like most scents
3736118 but this i really like its light it smells fresh its like it belongs on me
3736119 she had a very precise idea about the notes in her perfume
3736120 the fragrance she asked me to make was in a completely different range of my usual creations
3736121 i always wanted to do something on my own but i didnt believe that this passion would become a business
3736122 in my mind its ok if i have to spend a little more because i really want to go for the experience
3736123 but im going to have to live kind of frugally during the fall semester so that i can afford to be over there
3736124 even if students have some kind of financial aid that doesnt help them with the cost of living
3736125 studying abroad is a transformative experience but students really have to sock away money or count on the largess of their families to help them out
3736126 it used to be that these programs were seen as an add on but increasingly were seeing campuses that are looking at study abroad as a key part of undergraduate education
3736127 we havent had drastic pullouts but there are some students whove had to change their plans
3736128 theres anecdotal evidence that the numbers of students studying abroad may either hold or decrease
3736129 the euro is whats killing everyone because about 70 percent of our students end up studying in europe
3736130 and everything is less expensive than in the states theres inexpensive fruit 23 cent baguettes and its easy and relatively cheap to travel in country
3736131 theyre choosing so called nontraditional destinations like latin america the african continent and south asia thats been a silver lining of this process
3736132 our national leaders are looking at this as something that we cant cut back on and must invest in
3736133 its an expensive academic program to run but one that pays great dividends
3736134 being a russian sleeper spy and must elude capture long enough to establish her innocence
3736135 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3736136 it seems everyone knows to search various sites on the internet when purchasing an airline ticket but searching for a complete vacation package can save you hundreds of dollars
3736137 it sounded really interesting getting to make what you designed in your head
3736138 people are really interested in enrichment for their children more than just having fun they really want them to learn some of these girls may not be fashion designers but they may decide they want to work in the industry
3736139 with our camp theres a wonderful feeling of hand making things as parents we love the idea theyre doing these homey activities
3736140 parents are interested in getting their kids started on career exploration a lot earlier kids too are thinking more about what they want in the future
3736141 and its more fun this way you might as well go to camp for something that interests you
3736142 a lot of activity and a lot of it outdoors
3736143 its important for parents to ask the question what does my child really need
3736144 they need to make a decision for themselves and their child about whats the best way to test interests do i need a sampler kind of experience or am i so experienced that i can take all day doing one thing
3736145 they watch a lot of tv they think the same person goes to the crime scene and collects the evidence and interrogates the suspects this shows them what the work is really like
3736146 they see the work can be tedious and you have to be thorough
3736147 its fun to see them find a piece of hidden evidence they get so excited
3736148 on the opposite end if you drop a gum wrapper they think its related
3736149 i figured this was as real as it was going to get
3736150 if i like this then this is a possible career
3736151 when kids go to a general camp they start to develop interests in certain areas
3736152 the key is that its not that families are choosing specialty camps as a replacement to general camp especially for the younger kids
3736153 theres been a growth spurt in camps in the last 10 years we saw the enrollments going up in general camps and specialty camps followed
3736154 it used to be camp was designed to focus on athletics and if you werent an athletic child you still ended up in an athletic camp
3736155 now if youre not there are more cerebral options so it opens the doors to more kids going to camps
3736156 our motto is if its not fun were not doing it
3736157 although its based in science i like to think our camp encompasses a lot more working together
3736158 a lot of this camp is discovery them working on their own
3736159 they dont get to do hands on science in school anymore
3736160 im going to tell my mother my brother had the worst boat

3736172 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3736173 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3736174 the impact of russian actions goes beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia has used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west and aspire to our shared political and economic values my friends we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked with our allies we must stand in united purpose to persuade the russian government to withdraw its troops from georgia
3736175 he knows that the thoughts and the prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence

3736197 two days ago everyone was berserk in the olympic village some georgian athletes were crying over the possibility of being pulled out of the olympic games some very good judokas could not compete because their families are back in georgia
3736198 if i had had my family there in georgia i would not have been in a fit state to compete
3736199 the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship we have had so many big wars in the 20th century what we need is peace that is something politics can learn from sport
3736200 what we saw today at the beijing shooting range hall is a true demonstration of athletes living the olympic values of friendship and respect a touching moment

3736274 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
3736275 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3736276 they were having some keypads issues what the judges push the other was a broadcasters decision it was not nbc the beijing broadcasters were showing the floor live as alicia was ready to compete on beam they couldnt change in the middle of a live event
3736277 the reasons seem logical even though we dont like them
3736278 it was not our decision to hold the competitor from competing
3736279 those are decisions that are made by the fig international gymnastics federation competition official the federations run the competition
3736280 they never should talk to the gymnast and they are obliged to do it right
3736281 we did so much training of making them tough and keeping their focus and concentration and still it happens it is disappointing
3736282 at this point the fig and the international olympic committee have closed the age issue
3736283 its fair to address but at this point the competition was what it was today china was a better team on the competition floor i think theres no making excuses
3736284 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
3736285 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3736286 he knows that the thoughts and prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence

3736294 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3736295 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3736296 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3736297 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3736298 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it
3736299 were reported to have been seen in the village of tedotsminda near gori
3736300 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3736301 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3736302 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3736303 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3736304 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict

3736309 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3736310 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3736311 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3736312 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3736313 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3736314 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3736315 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3736316 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3736317 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible
3736318 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars
3736319 i hope one day that things will be back to normal
3736320 i would love to be able to sit up and watch television with him after the kids have gone to bed i guess i can keep hoping and praying
3736321 they were good neighbors and it was just a tragic loss
3736322 it was really a brand new plane if there were any problems it wouldnt have been cleared to fly
3736323 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3736324 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3736325 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded
3736326 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3736327 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3736328 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3736329 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane
3736330 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3736331 i am just wondering where this fits in with chinas solemn undertaking to allow us to report freely during the olympics
3736332 the fcc is appalled by this treatment of an accredited journalists within half a mile of the main olympic stadium
3736333 the quest for transcendence has always been closely linked to the ecstatic release of dancing
3736334 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3736335 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3736336 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters

3736344 we are somewhat concerned that this deal provides further evidence that the companys underlying fundamentals have eroded it takes some pressure off by providing the next catalyst
3736345 despite concerns on the deals valuation timing and strategic fit
3736346 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3736347 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3736348 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3736349 the national composite score has fluctuated over the past five years compared to our steady increases
3736350 our score is up six tenths of a point over five years and we achieved half of that gain this year i said before that we needed to improve at a faster rate to be competitive
3736351 now that weve built up this momentum it would be a shame to have it blunted by impending budget cuts
3736352 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3736353 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3736354 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3736355 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws

3736361 what happened last time you recommended a new team productivity tool
3736362 a very long time ago i remember learning about different types of process and how some were highly structured typical of transactional business and manufacturing systems while others were highly ad hoc typical of i think the distinction has validity but too often i see process change and innovation being discussed without making this important distinction innovative process change is a continuous but changing mature highly structured business processes is something that has to be governed very carefully

3736376 where do these anti christian organizations get their support do they believe in the bible or do they have their own extremist and fanatic code of conduct do they really believe that god is at their deposal and is capable of turning away from what he died for and believed in how can these anti christians condemn other religious that are as radical as they are are such organizations capable of doing harm to americans that do not share their beliefs what type of hatred are they teaching their children
3736377 all the moraly bankrupt advocates of homosexual marriage atheists and late term abortionists are the back bone of the obama moovement add other misfits such as wright ayers hanoi jane farrakhan gov judas and you get the surest recipee for dislocating moral and family values and the true american spirit we must go back to joseph stalin and hitler for an equivalent peril

3736418 mccain tried not to blame president bush for moscows aggression but made it clear he disagreed with bushs friendly attitude toward putin
3736419 i dont know if the president missed the boat but i do believe that the president probably had a higher opinion of vladimir putin than i do
3736420 im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century

3736430 we went back in and roughed up the studio version a bit i think it gives a fair idea of the kind of energy on the album
3736431 c lebrity is really a comment on the current concept of fame success and all that goes with it getting your face on tv is enough talent doesnt really enter into the equation celebrity is an overused and devalued word today
3736432 i see the song as rogers take on the increasing emphasis on fame for its own sake

3736434 that man is currently detained at pilgrim street police station he was not arrested in connection with the murder investigation

3736451 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3736452 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

3736455 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3736456 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3736457 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3736460 was bislang fehlte waren hinweise auf den zugrunde liegenden mechanismus
3736461 unsere ergebnisse zeigen dass diese unerw nschte wirkung von p53 unterschiedliche symptome hervorrufen kann
3736462 der jeweilige effekt h ngt wohl davon ab in welchem zelltyp das tumorsuppressor gen aktiviert wird das bedeutet aber auch dass p53 als eine art sensor f r die funktionsf higkeit von ribosomen fungiert und bei defekten je nach zelltyp und gewebeart verschiedene symptome ausl sen kann bei der diamand blackfan an mie geschieht dies m glicherweise durch den programmierten selbstmord von zellen im knochenmark die blutk rperchen produzieren unsere resultate erlauben nun hoffentlich eine zielgerichtete verbesserung der diagnose und m glicherweise sogar die entwicklung von therapien f r chronische blutarmut

3736464 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3736465 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3736466 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3736467 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3736468 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3736469 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3736470 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3736471 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3736472 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3736473 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3736474 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3736475 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3736476 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3736477 i promise you today that ill remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win
3736478 the aggressor has been punished and its armed forces have been disorganized

3736480 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3736481 everything fell on my head all of my body was buried in soil and mud
3736482 i dont think moscow will be in the mood even to speak to saakashvili
3736483 he has committed crimes against our citizens our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner hed better quit
3736484 the russians think in terms of spheres of interest and they think of the south caucasus as part of their sphere of influence
3736485 i am sure that this would not happen without consent of the u s
3736486 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3736487 russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3736488 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3736489 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3736490 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3736491 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3736492 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3736493 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3736494 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3736513 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3736514 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go

3736519 promotion was the climax of 2 years hard work and got the club back towards where it deserves to be to see so many hooped shirts inside hillsborough was an amazing sight and to celebrate in the crowd after with my wife and so many friends was a great feeling also we had a hell of a party all the way home on the coach and it was carried on back with the coach load of fans and friends that had travelled from stevenage long into the night you know who you all are what was it like working for the charismatic ian holloway working with ollie was a fantastic experience not at least for the fact we got all the one liners before you did on a serious note i felt he put a lot of pride and passion back into the club and was the sort of gaffer that you could talk to about anything whether it be football or personal you only have to read his book to be inspired and get an insight to everything that went on is there anyone you keep in touch with at qpr past or present i don t keep in touch with any of the lads in particular but my wife and i get over to at least 3 or 4 games a season to catch up and enjoy the atmosphere before and after we both made a lot of friends who supported the club during our time at qpr and still see most of them a lot now

3736533 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
3736534 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
3736535 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
3736536 for the first time we believe we make this distinction between the evolution of the genetic code codon discovery and the evolution of amino acid charging
3736537 when people continue to die and the outbreak continues to spread then officials undertake late fire fighting measures to combat the outbreak
3736538 afterwards the officials forget what occurred and eventually wait for the next report of cholera due to the lack of a comprehensive control program such a pattern repeats itself time after time
3736539 unsere untersuchungen haben gezeigt dass fast ausnahmslos der preis die motivation f r einen wechsel des anbieters ist die hohe inflation ist l ngst nicht nur mehr gef hlt sondern schl gt sich in den realeinkommen der kunden nieder nimmt man die hohen benzinpreise noch dazu berlegen sich nun viele haushalte schneller wo man noch einige hundert euro im jahr zus tzlich einsparen kann
3736540 die situation gestaltet sich f r die etablierten anbieter mehr und mehr als herausforderung wie mit der neuen lage umzugehen ist zwar gibt es einen anteil sogenannter resignativ zufriedener die sich zwar ber den hohen strompreis rgern jedoch nicht gleich wechseln der gro teil der kunden w gt jedoch den preis samt dem einsparungspotenzial ab
3736541 dieses motiv ziehen nur vier prozent der kunden in betracht
3736542 der demografische wandel ist im operativen bereich der unternehmen angekommen in deutschland wird im jahr 2015 jeder dritte erwerbsf hige lter als 50 jahre sein die gruppe der 50 bis 64 j hrigen wird bereits bald die der 35 bis 49 j hrigen als st rkste gruppe der erwerbsbev lkerung abl sen
3736543 das schwerpunktprogramm will wissenschaftlich fundierte erkenntnisse zur gestaltung zukunftsf higer arbeitsstrukturen und technologien unter den bedingungen des demografischen wandels generieren diese sollten nicht nur von herausragender bedeutung f r die betriebliche praxis sein sondern auch s mtlichen gesellschaftlichen akteuren auf dem gebiet der arbeits und besch ftigungspolitik als entscheidungshilfe dienen

3736548 en el caso de tokman este escucha y proyecta las demandas de las empresas y no las del consumidor
3736549 los medios de comunicaci n as como lo han hecho con la delincuencia efect en un trabajo investigativo al interior de las oficinas de pago de estas empresas para que constaten el grado de abusos y de impotencia de las victimas de las compa as el ctricas ya que de consumidores se han transformado en el ltimo tiempo en victimas de las distribuidoras el ctricas

3736560 he started to cry again and it continued for 20 minutes a k and exorcised s were also crying but during this minutes m keep his hands on the wooden box after he calmed down he tied up his hand and the box with the towel
3736561 the thing in the box is the grudge of the people itself
3736562 actually it is a lot of human beings index fingers and naval strings
3736563 we shouldnt discriminate someone the grudge from the people makes such a thing
3736564 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3736565 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3736566 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3736567 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3736568 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3736569 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
3736570 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3736571 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3736572 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3736573 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3736574 these results show that a patient may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
3736575 the results of this study could change the way breast cancer patients are treated
3736576 the good news is the that the two treatments are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic
3736577 establishing the most effective combinations of drug treatments and the timings in which they are given is an important area of clinical research
3736578 apart from short sections in the prison service orders on disability and women there remains no national strategy for older prisoners
3736579 there is still far too much reliance on the unsupported initiative of particularly committed officers and too great an assumption that the care of older prisoners including their social care is a matter for health services and not for the whole prison
3736580 an ageing prison population is being squeezed into overcrowded jails designed and run for young men
3736581 as well greater use of community punishments for older offenders ministers should also consider developing specialist secure accommodation for the elderly in cases where a custodial sentence is necessary

3736669 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3736670 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3736671 the results of those meetings will then be fed back to me and also to the icc vice president sharad pawar and icc chief executive haroon lorgat on 20 august so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3736672 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3736673 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3736674 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event
3736675 we are all grateful for the opportunity to visit pakistan and receive briefings and demonstrations which have allowed us to observe first hand the reality rather than deal in theories or perceptions

3736680 earlier this place was infested with militants but with the setting up of different factories and development projects the problem of militancy is almost over jobs are available now and youth are no more inclined to join insurgency
3736681 a few years back this place was known as a remote area and it was a home for the militants but now due to these factories which is developed over here it has changed a lot in the villages or in the remote areas people now realize that instead of accepting the weapons if they come over here if they work for their livelihood here theres a far better chance a good chance for their livelihood

3736749 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3736750 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3736751 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3736752 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3736753 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3736754 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest

3736758 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3736759 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3736760 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3736761 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

3736803 weve really seen the emergence of semantic web from the research lab were just on the cusp of r amp d to a range of real world applications
3736804 semantic web has been around for a while now a lot of work has been done on the building blocks
3736805 you have to be open to having your data shared which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web pages or your computer

3736814 linked open data is the web done as it should be
3736815 imagine writes nowack you are looking for a job in california at a company that is at a specific funding stage crunchbase knows everything about companies investments and has structured location data crunchboard on the other hand has job descriptions but only a single field for city and state and not the filter options to match our needs
3736816 this is where linked data shines if we find a way to link from crunchboard to crunchbase we can use semantic web technology to run queries that include both sources and with sparqlscript we can construct and leverage these links below is a script that first loads the crunchboard feed of current job offers only the last 15 entries due to common rss limitations practices the use of e g hatom could allow more data to be pulled in in a second step it uses the company name to establish a pattern join between crunchboard and crunchbase which then allows us to retrieve the list of matching jobs at stage a companies with offices in california
3736817 binary assumptions about women and men are not reflected upon or the gender politics of a particular domain is ignored thus the existing structural symbolic gender order is inscribed into computational artifacts and will be reproduced by their use
3736818 minority views quieter voices and allows the dominant voice to speak for everyone which seems highly problematic
3736819 that the perspectives i tried to sketch here can contribute to build better semantic systems or even prevent them from failure in function or on the marketplace
3736820 with the use of the internet we are already witnessing a radical change in practices of how knowledge is represented stored and spread
3736821 alison adam analyzed the well known ontology cyc she revealed that the knowing subject implicitly assumed by the system is a white middle class male professional
3736822 values other than male and female may be used but are not enumerated here the foaf gender mechanism is not intended to capture the full variety of biological social and sexual concepts associated with the word gender

3736829 quando iniciei o desenvolvimento da minha nova cole o pensei muito no branco e nas v rias tonalidades que se aproximam dele
3736830 assim surgiram algumas cores como o sunset color nude off white nevoa blanc casse todas derivadas do branco
3736831 o preto se tornou artif cio um pouco bvio na busca pela eleg ncia
3736832 o branco remete praia ao frescor celebra o sem deixar de ser uma cor cl ssica
3736833 o grande lance est em quebrar o branco total com detalhes metalizados usando acess rios de cores fortes como o rosa o pink uma faixa de cetim amarelo
3736834 o preto emagrece e o branco evidencia as curvas por isso h limita es
3736835 o branco pode ser conciliado com volumes para ter as propor es corretas respeitando as medidas de cada mulher

3736845 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men

3736847 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3736848 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3736849 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3736850 since its establishment our bank has achieved good results in building a strong credit portfolio with this loan from ifc we will be able to further support sustainable private sector development
3736851 ifc is partnering with kyrgyz banks to develop the countrys microfinance industry and expand access to credit for micro small and medium businesses this will help the bank diversify its loan portfolio and grow stronger while at the same time creating opportunities for people to grow their businesses
3736852 i am very pleased that we have achieved fairtrade status as this is something i am extremely passionate about and wish to thank everyone who has supported this fairtrade campaign
3736853 the university has worked extremely hard over the last few years to achieve fairtrade status and we now offer an extensive range of products in all our outlets and promote the meaning of fairtrade to the campus population
3736854 we are really thinking about the products we sell and the impact these have on producers and less privileged communities
3736855 by making this change we felt fairtrade would have an anchor and strong student representative ensuring fairtrade was at the top of rusus agenda
3736856 the next stage is to look into are other products the university could use and sell to continue to drive awareness of fairtrade starting with green week at the beginning of the october term
3736857 if you find your voice you can write it right away

3736863 sccs theatre arts faculty have always talked about the theatre artist that we are not just actors or directors but that our craft comes from the collaborative effort of the artists
3736864 this fundamental training allowed me to feel at ease with everyone at the oneill center and has solidified my pursuit of theatre success
3736865 an act to add agricultural workers to those protected against retaliation in the workplace and to direct the pesticide board to adopt rules requiring licensed pesticide applicators to record the specific time of day when each pesticide application is completed as recommended by the governors task force on preventing agricultural pesticide exposure
3736866 this new law helps us move forward to protect the health of our farm workers
3736867 requiring employers to keep more detailed records of pesticides being used and forbidding retaliation against those who might complain about exposure to these chemicals are important steps toward safety in agricultural workplaces
3736868 there is more to be done and we will continue to develop new health protection measures and work to see they are implemented
3736869 this partnership between our revenue department and community colleges will help those who run small businesses to understand and follow our tax laws so they can focus on making their businesses successful
3736870 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby

3736876 im shocked what with the mayor the city council and the council of churches against it
3736877 but i think theres a lot of illegals driving without a license
3736878 ultimately this will allow us to create better biofuel crops
3736879 right now about half of the biofuel crops dont have genomic databases and the ones that do are in many different places and are annotated differently which makes it difficult to compare and use the information
3736880 our biofuel genomic database portal will include information on any crop that can be used to produce cellulosic ethanol including all the grasses such as corn rice maize wheat and other biofuel species such as poplar willow and pine
3736881 this will save researchers a lot of effort so we expect it to be a valuable resource for scientists at msu and around the world
3736882 cellulosic biofuels offer one of the best near to mid term alternatives we have on the energy production side to reduce reliance and imported oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to meet the nations transportation energy needs
3736883 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges
3736884 and these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen

3736900 coaches here want to see you do it when youre tired at the end of the game when its overtime
3736901 if you get complacent and you just settle for eight sacks or seven forced fumbles then where do you go from there now my goal is double digit sacks just because youre here doesnt mean you can just tail off
3736902 last year he was just trying to make the team now hes trying to be a starter hes competing really hard but i want him to take it to another level right now hes a third down player but hes good enough to play on every down
3736903 he played in the arena league and they dont have any tight ends there
3736904 so he hadnt lined up against a tight end for a long time until he came here last year in arena ball its really just rush rush rush thats a big adjustment
3736905 coaches here want to see you do it when youre tired at the end of the game when its overtime they want to see you do it from the first snap of the game to the 80th snap
3736906 he was cut by five different teams do you realize that
3736907 he wasnt even going to come to tampa he always got cut on the last cut its a pretty neat feeling to see whats happened
3736908 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3736909 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3736910 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3736911 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3736912 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3736913 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3736914 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate

3736916 there are two main types of pollutants in the air in almost any city in the world toxicants the gaseous type and particulate matter
3736917 both types can be concerns for human health and the chinese government is doing everything possible to try and control the situation as best as it can which is not easy
3736918 one of the biggest problems is that there are other pollution sources in the region
3736919 so that means that much of the bad air can be transported from one area to another and theres not much they can do about it so its not just a beijing problem its a regional problem
3736920 we are looking at several factors including studying the complex chemistry of the air in beijing looking at emission controls and their effectiveness studying the surrounding air from other regions and how it can affect beijing s air and also to compare all of our findings with air quality in other cities we have examined such as mexico city and houston
3736921 we hope to know much more about the similarities and differences in the air in these cities all of which have faced immense pollution problems for many years

3736926 an overwhelming majority of respondents from the three racial ethnic groups consider racial tension to be a very important problem in the united states
3736927 a majority of hispanics asians and african americans would prefer to do business with white anglos rather than with the other two racial ethnic groups
3736928 significant percentages of all three groups share negative stereotypes about the other two
3736929 forty six percent of hispanics and 52 percent of african americans agree with the statement that most asian business owners do not treat them with respect smaller percentages of hispanics and african americans disagree
3736930 just over half of african americans feel threatened by latin american immigrants because they are taking away jobs housing and political power away from the black community while 45 percent disagree only 34 percent of asians feel hispanics are displacing them

3736951 about half of them have returned and we hope that the rest can go back to their homes the day after tomorrow
3736952 its a problem but not a humanitarian crisis as we have seen the numbers speak for themselves we only have about 15 000 families remaining and they are slowly going back to their homes we want to make sure their villages are safe before they return
3736953 they can bring their complaint to the ceasefire committee because taking him to court might have an adverse impact on the peace process

3736975 the accelerating growth of carbon markets resulting from the un brokered climate change agreement
3736976 there is too much emphasis on seminars workshops and needs assessment
3736977 for how long will our needs continue to be assessed
3736978 on the one hand the question will rich nations really show the type of leadership required for poor countries to engage
3736979 secondly can we mobilize the finance and technology that will make it possible for developing countries to engage
3736980 but for them to do that technology financial resources and capacity building have to be provided by rich nations
3736981 many of our coastal islands are threatened by rising sea levels
3736982 we cannot estimate the total cost as we dont know how severe the impact will be it is already impossible to grow cotton and maize in some areas how much the losses will be is harder to say
3736983 but the procedures are too complicated africa is already behind in terms of foreign direct investment and the same problems stand in the way of cdm projects
3736984 its a major flaw developed countries need to reduce their emissions by 90 per cent we need more drastic action market forces alone cannot deliver the emissions reductions that are needed markets caused the problem in the first place
3736985 most adaptation finance will have to come via development aid it must become mainstreamed into the development process
3736986 when africa only has 30 cdm projects out of 1 000
3736987 building opportunities for developing countries to access carbon finance in support of low carbon development goals
3736988 we prefer not to have a proliferation of funding from other multilateral agencies
3736989 parallel funding channels could further marginalize developing countries from having a stake in the fight against climate change

3737000 increasing temperature and increasing carbon dioxide the result of global warming increase the ragweed pollen production up to two to four times than its normal production the previous years
3737001 im seeing patients that never have allergy before even in their 60s 70s or 80s or young children became sensitized directly to ragweed pollen
3737002 if you are a patient and have allergy problems and suffering if you check the pollen count and its very high then you need to plan ahead

3737005 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3737006 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3737007 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3737008 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3737009 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3737010 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3737011 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3737012 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3737013 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3737014 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3737015 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3737016 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3737017 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3737018 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3737019 the government does not want to see a slump in the car market the policy is just a symbolic gesture to raise public awareness in a high oil price year
3737020 if china decides to raise prices by another 1 500 yuan per tonne to close the gap with international markets oil could hit 90 if china tops that with fuel tax oil could dive to 70 80
3737021 we made preparations to welcome and entertain them but they canceled their visit they promised to come to south kalimantan another time
3737022 they left banjarmasin because of government regulation no 10 issued in 1960 which made it impossible for chinese ethnic residents who were not indonesian citizens to remain in indonesia
3737023 had they come to south kalimantan they would have enjoyed nostalgic moments at the former ma wahoa building or places where they were raised
3737024 the visits are to be adjusted to the students different fields of study as some of them are studying to become doctors while others are studying to become nurses teachers or travel agents

3737065 no one will say it out loud but the lack of uptake in honours maths in ireland is due to teacher performance
3737066 the teaching of maths is the single most important factor in a childs education and the fact of the matter is the education system cannot surpass beyond the quality of its teachers
3737067 talk of the maths failure rate being an international problem is a cop out
3737068 we have the potential to improve the interest in maths science and engineering but were not creative enough to take the right steps
3737069 this is a real economic issue for ireland in terms of companies that rely on students coming out of engineering and computer courses we are asleep when it comes to maths and we are just hitting the snooze button when maths points are brought up were just not getting out of bed on the issue and this could be disastrous for the economy
3737070 maths is the language of the knowledge economy we have to address teacher performance a whole series of steps are needed but it requires bravery at the department of education and science
3737071 some of these people only have to do a module as part of one year at teacher training college to be qualified to teach honours maths we have to acknowledge the fact that honours maths requires special treatment
3737072 all technology companies are finding it hard to get irish talent smes are finding it hard and they are competing against organisations like google intel and ibm if an organisation has 20 polish it engineers in a high cost location like dublin surely someone in head office is going to be asking why dont they have an office in a lower cost location like poland this is potentially a very serious issue for the economy and no one seems brave enough to take the steps that need taking
3737073 there is still resistance from young people to engineering and science training in schools and colleges and there continues to be an ongoing shying away from these so called hard subjects
3737074 it is the governments responsibility to foster the countrys economic interests and a key element of this is an education system that equips students to face the modern world and solve the challenges of today and the future
3737075 maths has been a cause for concern for some time and obviously the 12pc failure rate is disappointing the government is aware reform is needed at second level as there is not adequate understanding of mathematical concepts
3737076 we aim to ensure this changes by introducing project maths in 24 schools this september which is a new concept to bring about a cultural change in the teaching of maths

3737107 this was a pretty unpleasant assault against a stranger who you foolishly accused of being a paedophile
3737108 this was a vigilante type assault which took place in the victims home in the morning you had both been drinking
3737109 you used the spray igniting it as some type of flame thrower
3737110 the victim was injured surprisingly not seriously but he was afraid to leave his flat and has trouble sleeping

3737133 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3737134 and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3737136 it is completely unacceptable for the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be put into question
3737137 i dont want us to get lost in a long discussion about responsibility for the escalation of the last few days
3737138 my question is about my sweet pea hes 15 weeks old and the poor thing has 2 problems hes been diagnosed with torticollis and were going to therapy for that which is super frustrating he also has recently had x rays that indicate he might have craniofacial dysostosis i dont know a whole lot about either problem but what ive read about it freaks me out have you or the readers possibly had experience with either of these

3737161 i have nothing to do with his election i dont care
3737162 but as i looked at it i could not say that violating a rule which could happen to somebody was an ethics violation
3737163 if and when we violate their right to speak we are violating the right to speak for several of thousands of persons he is there to represent
3737164 you know how i feel about it you are only making it harder for yourself
3737165 i hope this guy is more cooperative than his brother was at his newborn shoot
3737166 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3737167 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3737168 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3737169 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3737170 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3737171 just in the last week weve seen two severely injured children both had tvs fall on their heads
3737172 in the past five years weve seen about 35 severely injured children with tvs falling on their heads
3737173 theyre either pulling tvs over on themselves or theyre climbing up on something like a drawer and the tv is not anchored
3737174 theres a toy on top of the tv he climbs on the top he weighs 20 or 30 pounds or so and pulls it over on himself
3737175 this thing is balanced and the corner of it hits his head and breaks his skull
3737176 all he heard was a loud crash and when he turned around he saw the tv on my sons head
3737177 michaels not going to be able to walk right back into the nfl
3737178 hes going to need some kind of buffer before he signs in the nfl and well be able to provide that for him
3737179 first of all its gigantic tons and tons of elbow room
3737180 talk to the restaurant manager right on the spot and make a stink then
3737181 you want to make sure youre talking to someone who can actually fix your situation
3737182 the camera has to pan back just to keep everyone in the picture
3737183 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3737184 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3737185 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3737186 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3737187 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3737188 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3737189 i think the answer is yes and is coming back maybe stronger than it was before
3737190 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorize them with attacks and crimes
3737191 i dont have any illusions about that happening but id like people not to see it
3737192 this has to be a teachable moment its not about the movie its about being sensitive to the human dignity of others
3737193 as far as im concerned the whole thing is a satire and with satire you make fun of things
3737194 there was no harm involved it wasnt done meanly in satire everybody gets a little banged up thats the whole point of it
3737195 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3737196 satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters
3737197 there was a six minute steadicam shot with young christian bale he goes outside all the way through the camp into the barracks and all the way to where john malkovich is waiting with these guys me and joe pantoliano and i screwed up my line my one little line
3737198 no no no you never cut you never cut and spielberg is yelling while i lost all the blood in my body spielberg was nice enough to actually say hey dont worry about it whenever ive crossed paths with him weve joked about that moment
3737199 its so funny because it was so never our intention
3737200 if i had been targeting someone you would know because i wouldnt have stopped until i destroyed him
3737201 im making fun of myself as much as i am eddie murphy
3737202 to toms credit he thought it was funny and i think its because he just has a really great sense of humor about himself
3737203 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3737204 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3737205 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3737206 no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3737207 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3737208 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3737209 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3737210 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3737211 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3737212 its just not responsible to be saying things like that
3737213 what were doing has been effective now theyre having to go try different things
3737214 clearly san diego has seen an upturn in smuggling by sea
3737215 it has consistently been the experience that strengthening in one place leads to new places becoming pressure points
3737216 syspros global distribution model is heavily geared towards partners for sales and implementations which has also proven to be quite advantageous to the company
3737217 the syspro partners are experts in both sales and implementations and have the regional and vertical market expertise in each geographic region where syspro has strong presence the dominant sales and implementations model is via partnerships
3737218 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3737219 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3737220 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3737221 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3737222 we got an automatic green light to go through mexican customs and then we were blindfolded and taken to a house in tijuana they held a pistol to my stomach all the time we were in the car
3737223 transnational kidnappings are a new way of operating for these criminal groups mainly in california and so we are seeking collaboration with the united states
3737224 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3737225 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3737226 macro investors are torn between two views were in something like the 1970s or were in something like the 1930s
3737227 the world continues to go through a period of adjustment from excess and the mispricing of risk
3737228 i dont think that it would be remotely possible to say that this is coming to an end
3737229 russian tanks rolled into the crossroads city of gori on wednesday then thrust deep into georgian territory violating the truce designed to end the six day war that has uprooted 100 000 people and scarred the georgian landscape
3737230 i think the worst is behind us for the banking industry
3737231 we still see big increases in loan losses in areas such as home equity auto and probably credit cards
3737232 but if you look at the structure of the industry you see theres more equity in banks than the last couple years their deposits are rising their reserves are higher their loan volumes are growing
3737233 its just that you have this terrible loan loss problem
3737234 its like the old clich that the pig has to go through the snake when we finish with this loan loss problem i think youll see that these big banks are in pretty good shape
3737235 given the structure of the u s banking system you probably have a couple hundred banks that are at risk of failing
3737236 you have to look at this way there are roughly 7 200 banks in the u s now the biggest five banks have 52 percent of the industrys assets
3737237 you likely will see failures among the 6 000 banks at the bottom but if you add their assets together they dont equal those of citibank
3737238 i think its fair to say which banks might fail
3737239 what depositors and shareholders want to know is how safe their institutions are i dont think there should be any prohibition on the part of analysts the news media or anyone else from speculating where the greatest risk is
3737240 the trend were seeing is that retailers mistakenly believe the only way to comply is to replace hardware they deem to be obsolete

3737242 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3737243 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
3737244 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
3737245 georgia has been sticking to its commitments but i dont think there is much to stick to here
3737246 the georgian side must immediately fulfill this key issue to remove all dangers concerning relapses
3737247 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
3737248 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
3737249 this is the first time that weve actually seen an invasion a unilateral invasion of a country
3737250 i think we have to think about this long and hard and deeply in the eu and in nato
3737251 in this case i think having your liberation taken away and facing your entire lifetime incarcerated in an indian jail and contemplating what youve done to me is a far more appropriate penalty for this crime than the death penalty
3737252 the front legs are than shorter than back legs the way its running it doesnt run way normal coyote or dog would
3737253 okay well do you kind of want me to do this or do you kind of want me to do that
3737254 i cant do this youve got the wrong guy i thought we were going to make paper chase
3737255 kiefer if you dont think that there isnt a night that i go to sleep where i know your future is in my hands youre crazy youre going to have to trust me
3737256 oh i really dug that i think i know what to do with that
3737257 oh i must have been having an off day or something

3737259 bigfoot seekers including a redwood city man who released a documentary titled
3737260 i think youll find that this is the real deal barrows said of the alleged discovery
3737261 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3737262 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3737263 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3737264 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3737265 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3737266 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3737267 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice

3737271 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3737272 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
3737273 president saakashvili briefed the vice president on the russian campaign against military and civilian targets throughout georgia
3737274 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
3737275 immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of georgia
3737276 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake

3737280 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3737281 whatever tensions and hostilities might have existed between georgians and ossetians they in no way justify moscows path of violent aggression
3737282 washington post moscow the past weeks events in south ossetia are bound to shock and pain anyone
3737283 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3737284 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3737285 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3737286 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3737287 for three hours there were people fleeing in cars i saw one with 11 people and a lada with eight people in it
3737288 were reported to have been seen in the village of tedotsminda near gori
3737289 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3737290 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3737291 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days

3737299 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3737300 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3737301 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3737302 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins

3737304 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3737305 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3737306 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3737307 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3737308 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3737309 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3737314 sources from the state senate told kcra 3 that a new deal brought to the table includes budgetary reforms including a a
3737315 gov arnold schwarzenegger sued state controller john chiang on monday after he refused to follow the governors order to slash pay for thousands of state workers to federal minimum wage as a cash saving measure during the budget impasse
3737316 the governors suit asks a judge to force the controller to impose the pay cuts until a budget is enacted because schwarzeneggers administration cannot wait for chiang to comply with the governors recent order
3737317 but chiang on monday criticized schwarzeneggers lawsuit as a misguided attempt to make the controller do something that is not feasible in such a short amount of time
3737318 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned chiang said in a written statement
3737319 in a letter they threatened to hold public hearings wednesday if he does not reverse his corrections moves they questioned why he exempted other departments for public safety reasons but not cdcr among the signatories were senate president pro tem
3737320 we believe your order fails to ensure the safety at these prisons the officers and staff the 170 000 inmates incarcerated and anyone who lives within a 50 mile radius they wrote
3737321 we have and will continue to review exemption requests for public safety and we are also reviewing exemption requests in corrections said schwarzenegger press secretary aaron mclear
3737322 with a veto threat looming lawmakers on monday missed a deadline to replace novembers 9 9 billion high speed rail bond ballot measure with an updated version

3737550 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3737551 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3737552 global political effort must be channelled into securing long lasting green farming solutions that put people not corporations at their heart and the uk government must look at the evidence before falling for gm industry hype

3737558 we bekeken maatregelen als certificaten van dokters en het controleren van hun bmi maar we beslisten dat het niet aan ons was om aanbevelingen te maken het is fout een meisje te dwingen tot een lichamelijk onderzoek zeker omdat de signalen van gezondheidsproblemen bij modellen niet altijd duidelijk zijn
3737559 we roeiden wellicht onze beste race van dit seizoen dat we niet in de a finale geraken ligt vooral aan de kracht van de tegenstanders
3737560 we versloegen voor het eerst dit seizoen de duitsers wenzel borwoski wat nog maar eens bewijst dat we groeien in dit toernooi tenslotte finishen we hier op amper drie seconden van de regerende wereldkampioenen cop spik de slovenen die in athene zilver veroverden en sedertdien op elk wk niet meer uit de top twee weg te slaan waren
3737561 morgen wacht ons de b finale de strijd om de zevende tot de twaalfde plaats voldoende snel recupereren en knokken voor een plaats bij de eerste twee lees de top acht want dat resultaat kan ons niet alleen een olympisch diploma opleveren het is ook de norm die we moeten halen om ons topsportcontract te kunnen verlengen
3737562 ik ben heel blij dit had ik zeker niet verwacht op de 200 meter mijn allereerste spelen zijn nu al geslaagd
3737563 dat ik ook het belgisch record verbeter is eigenlijk logisch na mijn 100 meter maar dat ik er zo veel zou afdoen had ik dan weer niet verwacht
3737564 dat motiveert me juist voor momenten als deze doe je het

3737571 why is it that the former days were better than these
3737572 this is a common saying and it is as foolish as it is common
3737573 in former times say they men might be more religious use more self denial be more exemplary
3737574 those who cry up the good old times should remember that time was never older than it is now and it is a great question if things were ever better than at this present moment let us leave off idle complaints and try to make our times better and wherein we cannot alter them let us leave them to god
3737575 it is folly to cry up the goodness of former times so as to derogate from the mercy of god to us in our own times as if former ages had not the same things to complain of that we have or if perhaps in some respects they had not yet as if god had been unjust and unkind to us in casting our lot in an iron age compared with the golden ages that went before us this arises from nothing but fretfulness and discontent and an aptness to pick quarrels with god himself we are not to think there is any universal decay in nature or degeneracy in morals god has been always good and men always bad and if in some respects the times are now worse than they have been perhaps in other respects they are better
3737576 this is a common opinion that in all ages prevails among men that former times were better than present ones that trade flourished more and men got more wealth and riches and lived in greater ease and plenty and complain that their lot is cast in such hard times and are ready to lay the blame upon the providence of god and murmur at it which they should not do for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this this is owing to ignorance of former times which if rightly inquired into or the true knowledge of them could be come at it would appear that they were no better than the present and that there were always bad men and bad things done frauds oppressions and violence and everything that can be complained of now or if things are worse than they were this should be imputed to the badness of men and the inquirer should look to himself and his own ways and see if there is not a cause there and study to redeem the time because the days are evil and not arraign the providence of god and murmur at that and quarrel with it as if the distributions of it were unequal and justice not done in one age as in another

3737579 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3737580 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3737581 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3737582 but things are definitely not as good as i thought it would be maybe if we were near the main venue
3737583 i love the olympics i like any event where the chinese could win a gold medal

3737588 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3737589 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3737593 i think he will look to improving shareholder value perhaps by spinning out parts of the business
3737594 the main worry for that business would be a slowdown in music sales not books
3737595 for none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone
3737596 intellectually we all know that we will die but we do not really know it in the sense that the knowledge becomes a part of us we do not really know it in the sense of living as though it were true on the contrary we tend to live as though our lives would go on forever
3737597 the power or powerlessness of your lists depends on the level of awareness from which you write it
3737598 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3737599 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3737600 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3737601 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3737660 what sri aurobindo represents in the worlds history is not a teaching not even a revelation it is a decisive action direct from the supreme
3737661 what was this decisive action and what does it mean for humanitys future this is the question left for us to fathom in our grappling with the future of humanity
3737662 of course the scope of such a statement as the mothers opens the doors on the invisible occult action of sri aurobindo to acknowledge such an action is a matter of faith and perhaps faith is a critical component in orienting ourselves towards the future but a more active aspect of such orientation needs to be an informed understanding of sri aurobindos contribution towards the future through his more visible expressions particularly his writings so what does sri aurobindo give us in his writings that helps in orienting us towards the future sri aurobindo provides us with a comprehensive map towards the future diverse yet integral every part of which is pregnant with the fullness of the whole in keeping with the perfection of a self existent and accomplished consciousness presaging the vision of human fulfillment

3737703 the ncomputing solution has contributed greatly to the success of the accc
3737704 after we installed the ncomputing devices our maintenance costs and power consumption were significantly reduced with the new pcs purchased with grants from various sources and fundraising efforts by our supporters at the afghan school project in canada and others more of our students are now learning valued skills that are leading to better jobs more opportunities and a better life for our people community members and visitors to kandahar now see our school as an example of whats possible with 21st century computing technology that recognition led shah ahmad saeed the director of foreign affairs kandahar to show his support by his recent generous donation of a high speed computer to the accc for which we are very grateful
3737705 i was amazed at ehsans commitment his ideas and his dedication
3737706 so i contacted the author of the article he then introduced me to ehsan the afghan school project was born and today it is a grassroots initiative that initially helped to establish and continues to help operate the accc
3737707 helping to provide pc access to the millions and millions of users who could otherwise not afford it is not only changing the face of education its changing the world
3737708 the accc is a shining example of what can happen when people gain this access as the people of kandahar join the digital revolution we are extremely proud of the part that the ncomputing solution plays in driving these exciting and necessary changes

3737712 our power generating facilities and transmission line continue to perform strongly and generate stable and growing cash available for distribution
3737713 looking ahead atlantic power possesses a number of key strengths that we are confident will lead to enhanced value over the long term our average power contract term runs for approximately 11 5 years and the path 15 transmission line has over 26 years of regulatory term remaining providing us with sustainable long term cash flows over the long term changes in natural gas coal or oil prices do not produce material changes to the portfolios overall cash flow virtually all project debt fully amortizes before the respective power agreement expires significantly de leveraging the balance sheet over time in addition continued demand growth combined with increases in project construction costs have significantly enhanced the inherent value of our existing facilities
3737714 we expect to receive distributions from the ownership interests in our projects in the range of 103 million to 108 million in 2008 an increase in excess of 5 over the prior year
3737715 in addition we are continuing to actively evaluate selective growth opportunities and with our strong balance sheet we have sufficient capacity to act on potential acquisitions without accessing the public equity markets
3737716 we continue to believe that the market price for our ips is considerably lower than the value of our company our assets are operating as expected our growth prospects are bright and our strong cash position and balance sheet provide us with the ability to support this issuer bid sustain our current level of cash distributions and act on growth opportunities without accessing the public equity market

3737718 protagonizamos un combate bastante duro especialmente en los primeros asaltos cuando l estuvo bastante bien y su estilo de boxeo se impuso al m o de pelear m s en la larga distancia
3737719 me llego con manos muy claras y luego me fue dif cil entrar en la pelea
3737720 tuve que cambiar mi estrategia al ver que l iba delante en la puntuaci n y me llegaba con manos muy claras
3737721 pude tranquilizar m s mi boxeo pero no me dio opci n y hay que darle cr dito a mi rival que manej muy bien la distancia
3737722 me voy contento por mi primera participaci n en unos juegos ol mpicos satisfecho del esfuerzo que he hecho y de c mo me han apoyado con el compromiso de seguir trabajando m s duro y entrenando
3737723 mis planes son de permanecer en el boxeo aficionado otros cuatro o seis a os m s para ver si puedo conseguir algo importante

3737727 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3737728 well frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft russians dont understand that kind of soft language
3737729 the russians are encroaching upon the capital they are making a circle
3737730 we will protect our capital until the last drop of our blood

3737733 the increase in feed and fuel costs have dramatically affected the catfish farmers ability to cover his expenses and make a living
3737734 farmers put their pencils to work and determined they might not be able to come out ahead
3737735 mississippi catfish acreage which peaked in 2001 at 113 000 acres decreased from 92 500 acres over the last half of 2007 to 80 400 acres by the end of july
3737736 there were 360 catfish operations as of july 1 2007 and now there are 330 operations in mississippi
3737737 most people havent stocked their ponds as high as before and arent feeding the maximum feeding regime each day that we typically do
3737738 were not looking at a maximum production scenario this year
3737739 it looks like inventory is being cleared as a number of operations are going out of business
3737740 those operations that are integrated and grow their own fingerlings and have their own processing plants and are major stockholders in the feed mills are the ones that will have the strongest chance for survival
3737741 it is dire for many people and there are a number of producers getting out
3737742 the price of fish at the farm gate is going to have to rise to 90 cents to 1 a pound very soon to keep people in business
3737743 to maximize your weed program you need to know about your weeds
3737744 so why is this plot total horseweed while an adjacent plot is a mix of weeds what caused that
3737745 not bad so how in the world did we take a weed like horseweed that 15 years ago wasnt a problem weed and make it a huge problem is it because of biology
3737746 well we sprayed roundup and killed it repeatedly then all of the sudden it became resistant at the same time we went into no till systems in big acreage thats how we made horseweed one of the top three weeds in the south in about a five year period
3737747 all day today i hope you hear this is not glyphosate in a different color jug
3737748 when weeds are sprayed with ignite at 3 inches it looks good the problem is weeds dont all come up at the same time when the majority of the weeds are 3 inches tall some are already 8 inches tall one here one there its common to think well i cant afford to spray those until all reach 3 inches tall but that means the ones that are already 8 inches tall will be escapes
3737749 were excited about getting this technology in arkansas weve got five glyphosate resistant weeds now
3737750 this libertylink technology is coming along when we need it
3737751 our research has primarily been focused on using ignite in a libertylink system weve looked at various rates timings and the use of residuals this will be different than when glyphosate was introduced when glyphosate was introduced it was roundup only until fields were clean
3737752 valor followed by ignite prefix followed by ignite and other weed control programs thats one of the big differences between the introduction of libertylink and roundup ready beans
3737753 at the end of the year we were able to clean the fields up at least until the arrival of these resistant weeds
3737754 with ignite and the libertylink technology we wont be able to do that ignite is not glyphosate it must go out much earlier in order for you to be happy with it at our pigweed location for example it must go out on 2 inch or 3 inch pigweed thats typically seven to 10 days after planting if we wait a week past that on 4 5 or 6 inch pigweed there are some control failures and you must have a sequential in order to clean it up
3737755 ignite is a bit weaker on grasses than glyphosate is
3737756 the ignite application has to go out on smaller two leaf to three leaf barnyardgrass to control it thats another major difference
3737757 the protocol were standing in front of includes valor at several formulations and combinations including valor sencor it also has prefix all applied pre and we come back with a post application of ignite all those fit well in the libertylink system
3737758 for example at the pigweed test location putting valor in pre really any of the valor combinations worked very well at lonoke the barnyardgrass location prefix which contains dual looked the best as a residual
3737759 one is ive got to get my volume up my coverage right
3737760 thats because ignite is not translocated throughout the plant as well as glyphosate translocation that does occur is mostly directed upwards not much downward
3737761 i believe our spray techniques will need to be refined some when we begin using ignite
3737762 we put out 12 15 and 20 gallons per acre with ai and flat fan tips this shows on horseweed the ai tips dont provide quite the control seen with flat fans until we get into the 24 ounces per acre range
3737763 tell us that rather than talking strictly about water volume we need to speak about coverage
3737764 whatever configuration a guy can put in to safely apply have no drift and get the best coverage possible is critical ignite is a contact herbicide and doesnt translocate as well as glyphosate
3737765 i think it is going to be very much a complementary crop
3737766 once you get it planted you dont have to work the ground
3737767 i was thrilled when i got the call from kanye himself to work on the diamonds from sierra leone project i was proud to give my knowledge and talent to speak on the topic of blood diamonds this was a situation that affected me personally as i still have many family members living in sierra leone
3737768 im happy with the outcome of this situation and appreciate that kanye and island def jam have resolved this issue i wish them the best i took a stand for what was right and for what i was owed nothing more nothing less those that know me and my story know that i am prepared to go to worlds end to fight for what i believe is right i would like to thank and credit my lawyer brian mencher esq for his hard work and commitment on this case to my friends family peers and fans that really got what was going on thank you

3737777 i want to give a copy of kids first to each and every one of my clients it will surely help lower inter parental conflict and make life better for children affected by this issue
3737778 adults who take the time to read this book will gain useful information insight and resources to help the children in their lives deal with divorce
3737779 it recognizes that these individuals along with their employers and educators have made significant investments into the canadian workforce and the canadian economy we dont want to lose those investments so the new cec encourages them to stay and makes the process easier
3737780 though this represents a positive shift in canadian immigration we would have hoped that the number of applicants coming in under the cec would have added to the overall immigration targets for 2008 rather than included in this number
3737781 by not expanding immigration levels successful cec applicants will take the place of qualified individuals who applied from abroad and who have been waiting patiently
3737782 its another typical primal scream trojan horse if you ask me to come out with a really beautiful melody with a really sick undercurrent with the vocals
3737783 i think that just because a record becomes more melodic or euphoric doesnt mean that your view of the world or the way you feel inside has changed its just a different approach to making music thats all the lyrical content is just as its not got any softer yknow if anything it may be more extreme in places so its just another way of putting your ideas across
3737784 in the last five or six years theres been an acceleration of fan magazines celebrity magazines and the fact that theres no real news on the tv anymore
3737785 if lily allen wears a pink dress and pink hair then its on the fuckin news while meanwhile britain is involved with two of the longest wars its been involved with in the last hundred years and thats iraq and afghanistan
3737786 theres a lot of fucked up sick shit happening but people are blinded to it by the way the medias controlled and i cant help but react to that it may be that the freedom that we have here is bought at a price and that price is torture in iraq i dont wanna be too negative i love our record its a pop record but i think youve got to say what youre feeling and write about it
3737787 because it gives you a sense of self frees your imagination and frees you to be yourself and suddenly youre not part of the adult world but in a world of your own making so i think thats where rock amp roll is revolutionary
3737788 if youre record producer you would get the best musicians to serve the song and then make it a great record and thats all were doing here we dont ask people lightly because we want then to add something to the track and thats all there is to it really
3737789 and josh homme i think hes one of the best guitarists in the world and there was always talk of both bands playing or recording together necro hex blues evolved from a jam and we constructed a song from the live instrumental jam
3737790 i think were just getting better at what we do
3737791 my personal opinion is that wed had such a good year two years ago with riot city blues and had a hit record with country girl and had such a great tour that we just wanted to get back into the studio write an album and get back onto the road as soon as possible

3737797 it just seems kind of ironic that he took the u s flags down and hes flying jets flags
3737798 christina had accepted suffering as the price for deep passion
3737799 i was pleased with the way the defense came out
3737800 they started fast and took an early and decisive advantage in that first series the coaches did a good job offensively after that and things started to even out
3737801 this is the most reps we had about 75 77 reps and the spirit from start to finish especially at the end it was very competitive
3737802 i was really pleased that was the best four minute situation that we had
3737803 the coaches did a good job utilizing their timeouts on defense and keeping the kids in bounds on offense it was about a draw both ways
3737804 i call it pretty music but the old people call it the blues
3737805 theres no such thing as an innocent bystander what was he doing there in the first place
3737806 ill look like whatever i want ill do what i want and i wont talk about it i wont put a spin on it ill just act as if nothing has changed nothing is unusual here
3737807 look im sitting down not to justify but to share a piece of my life and some of my dreams with anderson cooper and through him with all of you
3737808 i was angry with sammy then hed hugged richard nixon at a republican convention he was coked out and manic and i felt a race embarrassment

3737816 he tries but he cant do it yet hes not strong enough he tries to do the windsurfing
3737817 i tried it here the sail just falls down its kind of a shame my board and sail are covered with dust in the garage the last time i kite surfed was almost two years ago in aruba shame
3737818 i love the water and always had time for wake boarding and snowboarding kite surfing is the best water sport in the world because you can fly like a bird with out having engine as simple as mother nature and you
3737819 vitali his older brother by 4 1 2 years had started and i just wanted to be the same and better smiles
3737820 i got interested in boxing when i was 14 but never thought i would make it as an amateur or as a pro
3737821 i really wanted to be a doctor that is what i envisioned i would do with my life i dreamed about everything as a boy being a military man a spaceman but never a doctor
3737822 my first time was on grand canaria the weather was rough
3737823 as a beginner i had a leash connected to my board i lost the control over my kite and end up flying around it was pretty scary since that experience i respect the rules of kite surfing and no more have the connected leash to my board

3737847 weve got sixty four of the best poker players going head to head and there are no second chances you lose you go home the caliber of players and the cut throat game play makes for the most exciting spectator poker around
3737848 this tournament is all about pressure there are a lot of great players involved but in the end its all about who can focus on their cards and opponent not on the big chance of going home empty handed but i did it once so i can certainly do it again

3737851 if you look at insurers theyre running these massive legacy systems and these legacy systems are being held up and resuscitated if you will by an aging workforce
3737852 as this workforce moves on into retirement supporting those systems will become increasingly more difficult
3737853 the demand exceeds the supply were always aggressively trying to find talented people
3737854 we are trying to take a more proactive approach to both staffing and recruiting
3737855 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on
3737856 you just cannot continue to increase debts i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch
3737857 the owner has already invested an incredible amount of money but we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60m on players alone
3737858 on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially all that and with just 20 000 coming through the gates
3737859 people have to be realistic a few players might arrive but not for big money we have still got more quality players than we have ever seen at pompey
3737860 unfortunately our national federations are not being run professionally i hope they will understand the importance of professionalism and work towards developing that in future
3737861 dawson ive got a job for you where are you
3737862 youll be doing a datawalk in the unpowered sections of this ship
3737863 feel free to dedicate rec hall five to the task
3737864 it is not a progressive scan so you can start as soon as the closest bulkheads corridors and rooms are done
3737865 i just altered all the scans to gather data in a rough approximation of how you should explore you might want to observe the data as it comes in so you know the path
3737866 will do you still didnt answer my question about a timeline
3737867 as soon as the scans have finished on the debris that contains the engineering section the captain will be sending a boarding party as long as you are thorough with an eye toward salvage there is no timeline
3737868 it looks like it is going to be slightly more than four hours until the powered section is finished being scanned mister soldin when control is established seal off every possible bulkhead so we can pump an atmosphere in there
3737869 mister addison ill be in rec hall five relaxing before this datawalk could you make sure i am awake when the scans are ready
3737870 stevens ill need you to take the main engines offline two at a time and recalibrate the hydrogen recombiners
3737871 theres nothing wrong with them we will just be here for a while and id like to make sure everything is up to par
3737872 plus it might impress miss lee when she sees the fine job
3737873 carol would you notify second crew to wait until you have notified them to take their posts get soldin back in the mess when he is done so he can make them something special while they wait he can join the boarding party when everything is ready
3737874 national and provincial registries are critical tools for clinicians and patients these investments mean we will be able to offer hope and save more lives
3737875 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3737876 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3737877 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3737878 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3737879 this flexible approach does not outline particular steps or procedures to follow
3737880 this will help avoid battles whose costs outweigh their benefits to the president the senate the nominees and the courts on which they may serve
3737881 all of our leaders want our court system to remain the envy of the world and be filled with the best and brightest legal minds our country has to offer
3737882 we hope to bridge the partisan divide that has grown over many years and offer government a way forward
3737883 frankly thats an obscene amount of money and alabama is not alone in too many states judicial elections have become dysfunctional distasteful affairs
3737884 i urge lawyers nationwide to think about how they can make a difference in their community in this upcoming election
3737885 i think the public is probably unaware that many of the chemicals they use around their homes or the pharmaceuticals they take themselves ultimately end up in the natural environment and are very difficult to handle

3737893 it will be difficult for me not to get too emotionally involved with my acts so that is when i will be relying heavily on their help and honest outsider opinions at the moment they just keep telling me to be myself and call if i need them
3737894 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source
3737895 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3737896 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3737897 many companies are putting projects on the back burner unless they will show cost benefits in the short to medium term
3737898 even in buoyant economies cost reduction is the biggest drawcard for any organisation looking at implementing electronic billing
3737899 there are widespread expenditure reviews with projects that were firmly in the pipeline now on hold until the economy recovers
3737900 interest rates which have been raised 10 times since june 2006 are expected to remain high with government warning that economic growth measured by gdp will be 3 this year marginally higher next year and less than 5 until 2011 accompanied by moderate government spending increases
3737901 in the current economic climate companies cannot afford to stop marketing altogether so the option of low cost communication methods is very appealing
3737902 the business case for this is very solid and in our experience the investment required to set up this process is very often recovered within the first few months
3737903 customers that are comfortable using email and sms to communicate with the business are ready for self service options that will enable them to get the information they need through lower cost channels
3737904 providing alternative channels to answer frequently asked questions can reduce the overall cost to service the customer account balances payment due amounts or requests for more information can be inexpensively serviced through sms where the customer merely smses a key word to a short code and receives an automatic response from the system
3737905 other savings can accrue from more efficient use of manpower and general business process improvements the business case however is compelling and more often than not it becomes unnecessary to measure or include these soft savings in return on investment calculations
3737906 it follows that the response times from customers are much quicker and bills are settled more promptly with the benefit of significantly reducing debtors days and improving cash flows

3737917 vede e insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe ma viste le circostanze il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole
3737918 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende

3737937 did anybody look at anything did you make any adjustments did you see it coming
3737938 you know we were interviewing people and you never said anything thats true mainly because it didnt come up at the time they were having their first round of interviews

3737953 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got over excited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3737954 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online after math by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3737955 bottom line information obtained during the investigation led to these arrests
3737956 sadly the online version of the japan times article does not cover the views from the street where six people are asked if they eat whale and how often one has it a few times a year but is not particularly excited about it four are definitely not whale meat lovers the only pro whaling voice is the only non japanese asked a grad student from the us
3737957 a former iwc commissioner and now head of the japan overseas fishing association also touts whaling as a green alternative to modern farming
3737958 it is a much better way ecologically in terms of climate change instead of eating land animals particularly when you consider animal husbandry
3737959 insist on using lethal methods not because they are necessary but because they supply whale meat to the markets in japan to keep the whaling industry alive
3737960 catch up to as many whales as the scientists advise is sustainable
3737961 this is the common sense smart way to go about making the world a better place
3737962 as you know whales and other wild creatures are produced by natural processes so we do not need to cut down trees to clear land for unnecessarily grazing cows and other animals while we have unexploited natural resources available which can and therefore should be utilised on a sustainable basis in accordance with conservative scientific advice
3737963 mother nature certainly does produce whales albeit very very slowly
3737964 as dr mark diesendorf of the sustainability centre has pointed out reducing beef consumption could be accomplished in more than one way and indeed many more ways can be listed other than eating kangaroos and just to reiterate greenpeace does not endorse eating kangaroos nor is it advocating eating kangaroos as a solution to climate change
3737965 we have enough reserves in the budget of the russian federation this allows us to assign the needed money without altering the budget
3737966 we need to approach new fiscal liabilities in a very balanced and well thought out way additional money should only be sent where it is really necessary

3737968 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3737969 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3737970 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3737971 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3737972 the purpose of the curfew or saturation effort is to get the criminal element out of these areas of our community and to keep them out
3737973 in fact i have been receiving positive calls regarding the police effort and some leaving in other sections of town would like to be included
3737974 they are tired of living in fear they also want their constitutional rights protected
3737975 i dont need money to reach the riches i want

3737988 while we continue to help the government of iraq build its institutional capacity we must also remind the iraqis that our willingness to lend a hand in their countrys reconstruction has limits the iraqis are beginning to govern their own nation we must ensure this includes paying their own way

3738006 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3738007 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together

3738037 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3738038 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3738039 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3738048 diese marke ist so wichtig weil sie aus verschiedenen unterschiedlichen hochpunkten resultiert angesichts des abnehmenden momentums ist aktuell aber nicht zu erwarten dass die marke unmittelbar nach oben durchbrochen wird
3738049 ich gehe nicht davon aus dass es mit den 5 999 punkten f r dieses jahr getan ist es ist gut vorstellbar dass der dax in diesem jahr noch in die region um 5 400 bis 5 600 punkte hinein sto en wird
3738050 das momentum nimmt ab und die marktbreite fehlt aktuell beim dow jones das hei t es sind weniger steigende als fallende aktien im markt die europ ischen m rkte werden sich diesen negativen vorgaben nicht entziehen k nnen

3738058 the two most likely causes seem to be that someone is claiming copyright infringement or libel

3738060 the newspaper business needs fresh ideas it needs people who are willing to take risks and think outside of the box writing columns like sanders does that blame readers for the fall of newspapers is the worst possible use of our time and resources if i was the publisher of the chronicle my first money saving order of business would be to fire one debra j sanders

3738066 va remains opposed to becoming a voter registration agency pursuant to the national voter registration act as this designation would divert substantial resources from our primary mission
3738067 youd think that when so many people give speeches about keeping faith with our veterans the least the government would do is protect their right to vote after they volunteered to go thousands of miles from home to fight and give that right to others
3738068 and yet weve seen the government itself block veterans from registering to vote in va facilities without any legal basis or rational explanation

3738073 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3738074 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially

3738111 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3738112 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3738113 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3738114 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3738115 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married

3738147 over the years the series has developed into a real classic of childrens television and thanks to a new release and a feature movie it is still popular with people of all ages
3738148 with its charm and diversity the game does justice to the popular series on which it is based on every platform
3738149 the regulatory burden on business has increased considerably in recent years

3738156 after extensive industry consultation it was agreed that march would be the best time for the awards enabling the industry to enter all the major releases of the year
3738157 we are keen to see the new filmed support material be developed by each nominee as this is the sort of initiative that helps the wider world understand that the creation and development of video games is an art form often with teams of hundreds of people and budgets on a par with feature films
3738158 one of the many strengths of the british academy video games awards is that the focus is on creativity and innovation as opposed to a simple measure of commercial success this enables niche but highly creative work to be recognised and rewarded
3738159 if you want a peek at the sort of person wholl be running the corporate marketing department in a few years time you might want to spend a few minutes with sean tiner

3738181 paswan joined bjp in presence of kalraj mishra the in charge of partys bihar unit
3738182 my return to bjp is like a return of a man to his home
3738183 we did not know it but after the final he bindra told us that he found his gunsight altered but he is a very cool boy and has lot of patience lesser mortals would have panicked but he maintained his cool and went on to win the gold
3738184 i dont think that helps actually you cannot blame anyone for its your duty to take care of your gun he was the only indian to qualify so there were shooters only from other countries in that room
3738185 no because it was his duty to attend the gun you cannot blame anyone for that
3738186 it happened earlier also in abhinavs case during the sighter series he was suddenly scoring as low as 4 2 before gradually scores picked up it took him 40 clicks to reach the centrestage and he had just three minutes
3738187 its another matter that he went on to defy the setback and win the gold it only goes on to prove how good a shooter he is
3738188 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way
3738189 its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone
3738190 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims and of blamimg the real victims for the consequences of the conflict
3738191 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected
3738192 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3738193 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3738194 as a result of many hours of shelling from heavy guns the town is practically destroyed
3738195 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
3738196 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
3738197 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
3738198 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
3738199 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
3738200 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
3738201 is not about georgia anymore its about america its values america stands up for those freedom loving nations and supports them thats what america is all about
3738202 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
3738203 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3738204 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders

3738211 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3738212 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

3738214 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3738215 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3738216 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3738217 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3738218 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
3738219 spellbound lives up to its name i was hooked from the first page i still get the chills thinking about the demon filing his teeth cynthia eden weaves a remarkable tale wonderfully written and told in a way to keep the reader glued to the pages as the action immediately begins with the presence of luis

3738222 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3738223 it was a little too hard for me to get out of that funk
3738224 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3738225 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3738226 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3738227 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china

3738229 in china well have more people coming into gymnasiums and we will be stronger in the future
3738230 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future

3738256 the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws many democrats believe bans on most guns are common sense and they still support the handgun ban in barack obamas hometown of chicago boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric and they know it
3738257 the partys gun control platform plank puts the lie to everything they say
3738258 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional
3738259 even after a study done for the justice department found that gun shows are rarely the source of firearms used by criminals
3738260 people were calling in from the beltline because of the smoke

3738264 on tv who think that oil coming down is the sign of a global slowdown but we know that ridiculously inflated oil prices caused the global slowdown oil is the disease not a symptom
3738265 rolling their troops deep into georgia and seizing the city of gori without firing a shot maybe we should ask them to help out in iraq
3738266 the russians came first then just behind were the ossetians who shot at anyone they saw
3738267 the ossetians walk into homes take any valuables they want and then burn the rest
3738268 we decided to let lin maoke to sing on the stage and to use yang peiyis voice because yang peiyi has the best voice while lin miaoke is the best actress
3738269 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3738270 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3738271 the uk and austrailian press is way ahead of us publishers with pictures of the little girl yang peiyi who has crooked baby teeth and slight chubby face whats next more attractive chinese athletes accepting medals in place of the real winners
3738272 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3738273 wow i cant believe that anyone would do that to a child yan peiyi is adorable crooked teeth and all shes only 7 afterall talk about a blow to her young self esteem to be told shes not cute enough its also tragic for lin miaoki who will now be known as a fraud i think its a terrible thing to do to two innocent children
3738274 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political

3738284 so what i need you to do for right now
3738285 is sort of be the secret assistant to this assistant
3738286 dont worry i did the exact same thing when i first started here
3738287 used by nixon in vietnam the basic idea is that if you act like youre crazy or as the case may be pick a president who really is crazy but isnt really in charge people wont want to mess with you
3738288 in my view it is a mistake to look for strategies that build mutual trust because it aint going to happen neither side has any reason to trust the other for good reason
3738289 land for peace is an inherently flawed concept because it has a fundamental commitment problem if i give you land on your promise of peace in the future after you have the land as the israelis well know it is very costly to take it back if you renege you have an incentive to say you made a good step its a gesture in the right direction but i thought you were giving me more than this i cant give you peace just for this its not enough conversely if we have peace for land you disarm put down your weapons and get rid of the threats to me and i will then give you the land the reverse is true i have no commitment to follow through once youve laid down your weapons you have no threat
3738290 in a peaceful world what do the palestinians anticipate will be their main source of economic viability tourism this is what their own documents say and of course the israelis make a lot of money from tourism and that revenue is very easy to track as a starting point requiring no trust no mutual cooperation i would suggest that all tourist revenue be divided by a fixed formula based on the current population of the region which is roughly 40 percent palestinian 60 percent israeli the money would go automatically to each side now when there is violence tourists dont come so the tourist revenue is automatically responsive to the level of violence on either side for both sides you have an accounting firm that both sides agree to you let the u n do it whatever its completely self enforcing it requires no cooperation except the initial agreement by the israelis that they are going to turn this part of the revenue over on a fixed formula based on population to some international agency and thats that
3738291 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3738292 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3738293 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3738294 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3738295 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3738296 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3738297 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3738298 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3738299 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3738300 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3738301 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3738302 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3738303 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3738304 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3738305 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3738306 democracy promotion is not a mechanism for forcing structural change upon other countries

3738321 it gets places that dirt cant and dirt you can clean
3738322 with those two things we seem to do pretty well
3738323 youll spend three to four times as much on a ruggedized device but it will last four to five years versus a few months if regular devices are deployed to the field
3738324 companies need to make sure the applications are really deployed well
3738325 really understanding what kind of application a user needs and giving it to him is important
3738326 it gets places that dirt cant and dirt you can clean
3738327 with those two things we seem to do pretty well
3738328 youll spend three to four times as much on a ruggedized device but it will last four to five years versus a few months if regular devices are deployed to the field
3738329 companies need to make sure the applications are really deployed well
3738330 really understanding what kind of application a user needs and giving it to him is important
3738331 test your equipment when you have time and are not in the field you dont want to find out you have a problem in the middle of an expensive expedition
3738332 i find that mechanically inclined people seem to get more out of their equipment than not
3738333 i advise folks to practice practice practice adjusting and matching parts takes practice
3738334 in my experience some ball heads will not hold as much weight as others
3738335 slippage occurs because of weight or unusual stresses like the addition of a gimbal as long as you dont overtax the head any head should work fine you just need to know when it is time to step up to the next level
3738336 not to bring race into it but is it because he is black that these acts are called thuggery
3738337 because a man has tattoos or may play a certain way it doesnt make him a thug
3738338 this a list television b list film actress is on a hit network drama in a 2007 hit film and is fairly newly married in her pre nup it stipulates that she is to never be alone with another male in her trailer or dressing room now i dont know how her husband is ever going to be able to enforce that without a camera on her 24 7 but apparently she must get into all sorts of trouble when left alone

3738361 by tuesday the chinese media had already pounced on the story instigating a national conversation that government censors were trying to mute by stripping away many but not all of the public comments posted online the outrage was especially heated over the cold calculation used to appraise the girls

3738363 if you create such a body and you give them powers and they have got big budgets you have got to have governance thats accountable for spending that money and you have got to have transparent governance if you are creating a big organisation we are a little bit away from it but i think we are on that journey

3738366 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
3738367 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base

3738389 this show will be radically different from any other production of west side story ever done the musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity every member of both gangs was always a potential killer even then now they actually will be only tony and maria try to live in a different world

3738391 in my view it is a mistake to look for strategies that build mutual trust because it aint going to happen neither side has any reason to trust the other for good reason
3738392 land for peace is an inherently flawed concept because it has a fundamental commitment problem if i give you land on your promise of peace in the future after you have the land as the israelis well know it is very costly to take it back if you renege you have an incentive to say you made a good step its a gesture in the right direction but i thought you were giving me more than this i cant give you peace just for this its not enough conversely if we have peace for land you disarm put down your weapons and get rid of the threats to me and i will then give you the land the reverse is true i have no commitment to follow through once youve laid down your weapons you have no threat
3738393 in a peaceful world what do the palestinians anticipate will be their main source of economic viability tourism this is what their own documents say and of course the israelis make a lot of money from tourism and that revenue is very easy to track as a starting point requiring no trust no mutual cooperation i would suggest that all tourist revenue be divided by a fixed formula based on the current population of the region which is roughly 40 percent palestinian 60 percent israeli the money would go automatically to each side now when there is violence tourists dont come so the tourist revenue is automatically responsive to the level of violence on either side for both sides you have an accounting firm that both sides agree to you let the u n do it whatever its completely self enforcing it requires no cooperation except the initial agreement by the israelis that they are going to turn this part of the revenue over on a fixed formula based on population to some international agency and thats that

3738470 we endorse a bolder approach to helping vulnerable iraqis especially ones who are displaced current us efforts to help iraqis are a good start but they dont go far enough
3738471 the iraqi government is responsible for assisting its internally displaced population as well as other vulnerable iraqis and all efforts should be made to urge more action and assist its efforts
3738472 as their stay in neighboring countries drags on without any immediate solution in sight the protection concerns facing these people continue to rise
3738473 the needs are much greater we ask the us to reconsider resettling 105 500 refugees from iraq and if necessary to reassess this number for the next few years
3738474 there is clear negligence by the iraqi government other governments and international bodies via a vis the needs of the internally displaced persons idps and refugees in neighboring countries who are forgotten
3738475 iraq is still a country of conflicts and therefore the most dangerous place in the world
3738476 there are some families who have not been registered yet because government offices are located in remote areas and they find it hard to reach these offices to register

3738505 unemployment in northern ireland remains low with the latest rate well below the european union average and second lowest among the uk regions
3738506 employment levels have also increased over the quarter and this news is particularly encouraging given the well publicised slow down in the world economy
3738507 the fall out from the credit crunch is continuing to make trading conditions very difficult for northern ireland businesses
3738508 however if they remain focused on customer needs and continue to develop innovative high quality products and services they can continue to compete effectively in both the local and global marketplace
3738509 it is recognised that rural issues impact across all of government and that many rural concerns are no different from urban worries for example on health jobs housing education transport and services
3738510 i want to see every government department test its policies against rural needs and examine their likely impact on rural people and places
3738511 the aim of the rural champion concept supports this and will work to ensure that a mechanism and culture exists which allows for rural communities to highlight issues to provide evidence to support their views and propose sustainable solutions to the challenges they face
3738512 ensuring consideration of the rural dimension as policies are being developed rather than when they have been developed will have a real impact on the people who live and work in the countryside
3738513 i encourage everyone to avail of this opportunity to tell us what they think the rural champion concept should be about and how we can ensure sustainable rural communities

3738516 living in this new environment that we are today we now hope to bring them back to the cemetery
3738517 the event is open to everyone with visitors learning some precious family history while also helping improve the cemetery

3738590 it just goes far beyond what the police departments legitimate concerns are about terrorism or illegal activity
3738591 we have to protect the public license plates already identify you in the car if you want to have a civil liberty issue i suspect you should go to the state and talk about license plates
3738592 they are there to be read they are there so that people can take your license plate and look in a database so you should start at the beginning i dont happen to see that as a particularly great infringement on civil rights
3738593 it should bother the people who have something to worry about
3738594 if you have nothing to hide how can it hurt
3738595 im liberal when it comes to i dont like big brother watching everything you do but you know in these times what are you gonna do

3738598 i am pleased to report that we are off to a good start in fiscal 2009 and we will be releasing first quarter earnings on august 21
3738599 our top 15 brands which represent approximately 70 of sales performed particularly well over the past two fiscal years with a compound annual growth rate of 12 driven by continued double digit increases in r amp d and marketing investment against our tightly focused brand portfolio
3738600 we launched hundreds of successful new products during the past two years one of our more successful innovations was plastic snap pot beans in the uk these single serve microwavable versions of our healthy fiber rich baked beans are doing very well in the market another successful launch was smart ones r fruit inspirations tm the first health focused frozen entree with a half serving of real fruit this line of four entrees is already on track for 40 million in sales in its first 12 months
3738601 the new plan raises our outlook in several key areas with the following annualized targets sales growth of 6 increases in consumer marketing of 8 12 operating income growth of 6 7 earnings per share growth of 8 11 and operating free cash flow of around 850 million per year
3738602 heinz continues to offer consumers great tasting and convenient foods while also giving them the health benefits that they are increasingly seeking across lifestyle including products like heinz r steamfresh vegetables in australia and reduced salt and sugar beans and ketchup to promote general wellness childrens nutrition where we are a category leader in the markets in which we compete and weight management
3738603 combined our weight watchers r smart ones r and weight watchers r from heinz brands represent almost one billion dollars in sales and together are among the fastest growing equities in the company smart ones is rapidly becoming a lifestyle brand with an increasingly loyal consumer base and we continue to explore new meal occasions including the recent launch of smart ones morning express tm a line of four handheld breakfast sandwiches and quesadillas
3738604 smart ones torrid growth also continues in canada where it now has 7 of the top selling 11 varieties in the nutritional meals category only 18 months after the brand was first introduced
3738605 the health and wellness opportunity is large but perhaps our biggest growth opportunity is in emerging markets where we are leveraging our first mover advantage and go to market capabilities to drive accelerated growth
3738606 in fact emerging markets which grew sales 25 percent in fiscal 2008 are expected to contribute about a third of the companys total sales growth over the next two years
3738607 these markets accounted for 13 percent of total heinz sales in fiscal 2008 up from just 8 percent a few years ago with the growth trajectory i just described they are expected to reach 15 percent of sales by the end of our new plan and as much as 20 percent by 2013 this would be a significant accomplishment given the growth we are also experiencing in our developed markets
3738608 two of our newest innovations in the u s build on insights gleaned from extensive research which revealed that consumers want added convenience while still feeling like they are an integral part of the meal preparation process
3738609 ore ida r steam n mash tm potatoes and t g i fridays tm complete skillet meals satisfy both requirements
3738610 not since the days henry heinz was introducing his first 57 varieties have we been driving such a strong innovation agenda for the heinz brand globally we had a busy year of product launches for the brand in fiscal 2008 with another on tap for fiscal 2009
3738611 in australia we launched new varieties of heinz steamfresh vegetables in fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2009 we will expand steamfresh into the meals category
3738612 in the uk our heinz soup innovation pipeline resulted in record shares in fiscal 2008 and we have more new varieties planned for later this year
3738613 with a healthy balance sheet and abundant opportunities to explore in both the developed and developing world we are confident in our ability to execute value added acquisitions
3738614 die stahlbranche und vor allem die distribution hat sich von der schw cheren konjunktur in einigen regionen erfolgreich entkoppelt

3738616 das f r das gesamtjahr 2008 erwartete rekordergebnis und der hohe mittelzufluss bieten eine hervorragende plattform f r die strategische weiterentwicklung des konzerns

3738701 there is a vast crowd of youngsters who prefer wearing jeans and t shirts they do not usually wear fabindia clothes and they are not interested in home accessories we expect the jewellery to pull them to our stores the appeal of jewellery cuts across all segments
3738702 though we have eight stores in the gulf and a growing presence in the region at the moment we are not sending any jewellery out we will market it in phases as this is a new line of business for us we are trying to brand the unbranded

3738742 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3738743 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3738744 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3738745 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside

3738754 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous

3738764 we dont know a lot about the conference north teams yet and its new to me as well
3738765 we controlled the game from the start set a good tempo and the main thing is were still unbeaten
3738766 we put redditch on the back foot and we created quite a few chances but unfortunately we couldnt get a second goal

3738771 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3738772 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3738773 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3738774 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax

3738777 our season had finished and we were winding down one sunday evening with a couple of drinks when i got a call from the england coach asking us to join them

3738779 weve worked very hard and it was a real thrill to be involved
3738780 competition is tough because youre often up against professionals we have to fit our training in around an eight or nine hour working day because we still have mortgages to pay getting enough rest is the biggest problem it can be exhausting

3738861 gods word is going forth to the nations reaching those with the least access namely those too poor to afford a bible and those who can not will not or choose not to read
3738862 this milestone is a testimony to the eternal life of gods word and shows that the bible continues to be the most sought after book in the world
3738863 it is sobering to be allowed to make his word in audio available to every person in the world free of charge
3738864 when we recorded our first audio drama version it was word for word which we did to make gods word more interesting

3738879 this case has taken 10 years in trial court it cannot be treated as an ordinary case this was a clear case of criminal negligence priority ought to have been given to its hearing so that people can have confidence in judiciary
3738880 the system should not be allowed to suffer and nobody should be allowed to manipulate it
3738881 the petitioner has to produce the certified copy of the high court orders to enable this court to ascertain as to in what manner the case is proceeding
3738882 i would rather be honest about the realities of this business whereas so many people want to just sweep that under the rug and perpetuate what has been
3738883 look we dont know whats gonna work predicting what the media world is gonna look like in eight years is incredibly daunting i defy anybody to do that
3738884 when there were three networks and you could run your programs once and repeat them twice and thats all you had to worry about
3738885 he just does its corporate bragging rights it represents peacock prestige
3738886 not a great people person he already had a great ear but he hadnt yet developed the people skills
3738887 is that there has been no change i think hes the same guy he was then he could probably have taken the reins of nbc universal then hes probably pissed that it didnt happen then
3738888 i was very young i had a lot of success i had a lot of coverage
3738889 there was a tremendous amount of you know a lot of jealousy it kind of goes to my idea that we live in a schadenfreude world
3738890 youd rather make these calls a little too soon rather than a little too late
3738891 if you pick up a ping pong paddle in our house he will play you until he wins even on a weekend
3738892 i had a boyfriend when i met him i told jeff and he said you can still have dinner then he sent me flowers kept telling me to get rid of the boyfriend and he pursued me like a maniac when he wants something thats it one track but it wasnt done in a creepy stalker way
3738893 ive woken up in a hospital bed after surgery twice with staples in my stomach in more pain than anyone should be allowed in their lives
3738894 ive gone through chemo for nine months vomiting my guts out afterward then gone back into the hospital if people want to take shots hey ive had more pain than anyone can give me
3738895 he needs to be on the phone and on the blackberry at all times
3738896 he never stops working it never ends because it cant but i understand that i dont know if this kind of marriage could work for everyone but i completely understand it mainly because i used to work in television
3738897 its not a zero percent grower and im fine with that
3738898 theres nothing to that ever every business in g e has to earn its way sure
3738899 has been a concoction of other people it hasnt come from inside g e this is an inherently good business in a profitable industry and one we run very well
3738900 i dont think any media company has been as active in the past 16 months as we have

3738902 the industry can either adapt and go through a rational process or the industry can fail to adapt in which case the market will do it for them
3738903 the latter will mean that people go out of business in which case it will be much more draconian thats really what jeff is talking about trying to adapt to a cost structure that reflects the marketplace
3738904 look we cannot operate with the cost structure that has been in place for the past 35 years
3738905 we are going to crumble beneath the weight of that
3738906 there are moments of loneliness when you are out in front
3738907 once zucker realizes he is missing out on hit shows hell sing a different tune
3738908 hes not the first guy from out of town who thinks he can change the business things are done this way for a reason
3738909 theres a lot of mansions built in these hills on the old ways of doing business and they would like to perpetuate that
3738910 we know we will be in the business of projecting images onto screens but where will those screens be in your hand your car were a content company we produce television programs films newscasts local programs we have to drive that content through a lot of different mediums whether its your taxicab your elevator your cell phone or your handheld device
3738911 theres no example anywhere in the world where the retailer gets to set the wholesale price as well
3738912 it was heavier than a one in a hundred year storm

3738914 which cant handle the heavy flow during storms like this
3738915 and you pretty well have to wait until a house is demolished
3738916 but they have to rely on their own insurance for the rest
3738917 the biggest thing is drying it out quickly otherwise mould will set in and the drywall will have to be removed too
3738918 the boards selection of ron sevart is another key element in our plan to grow the space needles position as a cutting edge northwest business and to reinforce our total commitment to the renaissance of the seattle center area we are anxious to have ron take the reins and move us into exciting new directions
3738919 this cannot be natural we all know it wasnt something that happened 20 years ago but now its happening now we as a nation have to ask ourselves what the hell is going on
3738920 the sunlight is shining from behind the moon that could never happen this is totally new the only explanation is a government conspiracy
3738921 we will never forget what happened to our angel but today is more about celebrating katelynn remembering her
3738922 i loved you yesterday i love you today and i will love you forever
3738923 what our friend fails to realize is how god works
3738924 god weeps jesus weeps for katelynn you cannot understand the pain her passing has caused
3738925 this just shows what kind of community we have here
3738926 the grieving will never stop for some but the support we are showing is tremendous
3738927 if you listen closely katelynn is trying to send us a message
3738928 all that stuff that happened with shia definitely didnt help things
3738929 when adrian saw isabel with shia he knew it was time to move on and made the decision to end things hes not upset and thinks isabel is a really sweet girl but theyre done

3738961 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3738962 martha jones ex time traveller and now working as a doctor for a un task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
3738963 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france once activated the collider will fire beams of protons together recreating conditions a billionth of a second after the big bang and potentially allowing the human race a greater insight into what the universe is made of
3738964 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3738965 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3738966 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3738967 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3738968 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3738969 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3738970 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3739024 zuallererst k nnen wir georgien unterst tzen die territoriale integrit t innerhalb der aktuellen grenzen verteidigen und tiflis wieder aufbauen als zweiten schritt sollte der westen einsehen dass russland kein neutraler friedensstifter an seinen grenzen ist seit langem hat moskau sein internationales mandat benutzt um eine neoimperialistische politik durchzuf hren statt russland dieses mandat zu gew hren sollte der westen darauf bestehen dass neutrale un truppen den waffenstillstand berwachen drittens sollte der westen aktiv gegen den russischen einfluss auf seine nachbarn arbeiten besonders auf die ukraine die h chstwahrscheinlich das n chste ziel der bem hungen moskaus sein wird seinen einfluss auszudehnen die usa und die eu m ssen bei diesem punkt deutlicher sein damit die ukraine und georgien nicht als irgendeine graue zone bezeichnet werden
3739025 russland musste antworten es der aggression gegen das schwache schutzlose georgien zu beschuldigen ist nicht nur heuchlerisch sondern zeigt einen mangel an humanit t indem die usa den kaukasus eine region die tausende von meilen vom amerikanischen kontinent entfernt ist zu einer sph re des nationalen interesses erkl rten begingen sie einen ernsthaften fehler nat rlich ist der friede im kaukasus im interesse aller aber einzusehen dass russland dort verwurzelt ist durch eine gemeinsame geographie und jahrhundertelanger geschichte ist einfach gesunder menschenverstand russland strebt nicht nach territorialer expansion aber hat legitime interessen in dieser region das ziel der internationalen gemeinschaft k nnte auf lange sicht die schaffung eines sicherheits und kooperationssystems in den unterregionen sein das jegliche provokation und die reine m glichkeit einer krise wie dieser unm glich macht diese art von system aufzubauen w re eine gro e herausforderung und k nnte nur durch die zusammenarbeit der l nder der region selbst erreicht werden nationen von au erhalb der region k nnten vielleicht auch helfen jedoch nur wenn sie eine faire und objektive stellung einnehmen
3739026 die rechtfertigungen des russischen auftretens die wir nun von manchen europ ern h ren angef hrt vom italienischen premier silvio berlusconi muss man schlicht verurteilen europa l sst sich von moskau erpressen das nur allzu gerne mit der waffe der energie versorgung droht wenn europa f r etwas steht muss es diese werte auch verteidigen es hat die moralische pflicht die l nder an seinen grenzen auf einem schwierigen weg zu entwicklung freiheit und demokratie zu begleiten wer das auftreten von putin guthei t muss einsehen dass es hier um mehr geht als das statut eines kleines schmugglernestes wie glaubw rdig ist die europ ische union noch wenn sie zul sst dass kleine l nder an ihrer grenze mit harter hand wieder in das gro e russische imperium einverleibt werden
3739027 es ist auszuschlie en dass die von nicolas sarkozy in aussicht gestellten friedenstruppen unter der flagge der nordatlantischen allianz aufmarschieren werden angesichts der russischen irritation ber das gesuch von tiflis zur aufnahme in die nato
3739028 die westlichen l nder die die besten beziehungen zu russland unterhalten deutschland frankreich und italien die truppen stellen russland will verst ndlicherweise weder eine beteiligung amerikas noch der l nder des ehemaligen warschauer pakts oder der ehemaligen sowjetischen republiken womit auch die hoffnung von estland eines der ersten l nder das seine hilfe angeboten hat entt uscht wird wie im libanon wird die mission im einvernehmen mit den kontrahenten von statten gehen sie wird nicht den frieden gewaltsam erzwingen sondern ihn kontrollieren und gew hrleisten
3739029 das pendeln des pr sidenten sarkozy zwischen moskau und tiflis ist eine hochriskante aufgabe die schw che des pr sidenten bush am traurigen ende seines mandats l sst der europ ischen union die wichtigste rolle bei der durchsetzung von diplomatie gegen waffen in georgien zukommen die 27 mitgliedsstaaten verf gen ber echte tr mpfe um sich bei den kreml meistern geh r zu verschaffen vor allem im wirtschaftlichen bereich es wird noch eine weile dauern bis moskau auf die internationalen investoren verzichtet unter denen die europ er zur obersten gesellschaftsschicht geh ren schlie lich will russland den jahren der unentschlossenheit ein ende setzen und der welthandelsorganisation beitreten es stellt sich noch die frage ob die europ er diese tr mpfe ausspielen werden was voraussetzt dass sie mit einer stimme sprechen und nichts ist unsicherer
3739030 das alte europa h rt nicht auf polen litauer und ukrainer das alte europa will es sich nicht mit russland verderben und h lt die unantastbarkeit der georgischen grenzen nicht f r wichtig genug um die beziehungen zu russland zu verschlechtern wir k nnen endlos erkl ren dass es sich nicht um russophobie sondern um langj hrige erfahrung handelt und wenn nach georgien moldawien und einigen anderen staaten die zeit kommt dass europa von russland eingesch chtert wird werden wir zufrieden sagen k nnen dass wir gewarnt haben wir werden uns f r anst ndig halten k nnen nur die sicherheit polens wird von realen auf gemeinsame interessen gebauten b ndnissen gew hrleistet und nicht von moralischen argumenten

3739048 im delighted to announce that with the help of planned parenthood my blog for the first time received more visits than my teenage sons myspace page perhaps ill address the subject of physician conscience one more time
3739049 obviously some disagree with the federal law and would have it otherwise so they have begun using the accreditation standards of physician professional organizations to define the exercise of conscience unprofessional and thereby make doctors choose between their capacity to practice in good standing and their right of conscience
3739050 clear effort to subvert the law in favor of ideology
3739051 this is not a discussion about the rights of a woman to get an abortion this is about the right of a doctor to not participate if he or she chooses for reasons they consider a matter of conscience
3739052 it is currently a violation of three separate federal laws to compel medical practitioners to perform a procedure that violates their conscience
3739053 since you are such an old hand at the abortion wars then surely you are well aware of the anti choice tactic of defining abortion down the medically dubious assertion that pregnancy occurs before implantation a great deal of the outrage over this proposed regulation centers on the potential of your department legitimizing this view under the guise of protecting conscience thus putting not only access to abortion but access to necessary birth control in jeopardy and nothing you have said so far contradicts that
3739054 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
3739055 dont federal laws already protect doctors rights to opt out of performing abortions where is this serious need that leavitt stresses this seems more like a ploy to shift the focus from the medical issue of access to contraception to a theoretical abstract notion of the rights of man and citizen leavitts hoping to come across more like a modern day enlightenment philosophe than an anti choice bush appointee it aint working

3739064 what mike stoops needs to do to keep his job
3739065 it captures the desperation and the anger that many officers now feel
3739066 you should be aware of your rights so as to ensure that you secure your full entitlements as well as being aware of the obligations of your chief officer and police authority under those regulations and determinations
3739067 our members together with chief officers and police authorities are expected to comply with their obligations under the police regulations and determinations this is particularly so when police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government
3739068 ich halte den krieg f r ein sinnloses unterfangen da er keine probleme gel st sondern sie nur versch rft hat
3739069 ich habe sehr viele verwandte die jetzt in georgien sind sie sind gedr ckt best rzt und weinen weil georgien nicht ohne russland sein kann
3739070 s rge haben keine nationalit t die burschen die gek mpft haben sind kanonenfutter und zu sagen dass alle au er den georgiern unschuldsl mmer sind ist eine schweinerei ich bin der ansicht dass derjenige der den krieg begonnen hat auch ohne den haager tribunal erschossen werden muss

3739080 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
3739081 the new generation of 15 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
3739082 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal wheres it going to go to
3739083 thats my fear for the longer format that the motivation of players will be more geared towards twenty20 cricket
3739084 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that
3739085 its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3739086 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3739087 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3739095 speaking of edwards former hillary clinton campaign chairman howard wolfson made a splash telling abc news that had the edwards scandal come out before januarys iowa caucuses clinton would now be the nominee
3739096 in the networks iowa entrance poll 43 percent of those who went to a caucus to support edwards said obama was their second choice far fewer 24 percent said they would support clinton if their top choice did not garner enough votes at that location
3739097 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3739098 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3739099 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3739100 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3739101 equally those who did not benefit as much from early weight loss may have had the progressive condition for longer which could have made it more challenging to control
3739102 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
3739103 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
3739104 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
3739105 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
3739106 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
3739107 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
3739108 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
3739109 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
3739110 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
3739111 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
3739112 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
3739113 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3739114 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3739115 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3739116 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3739117 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children

3739127 well we had a couple of targets but the price wasnt right
3739128 ik ben heel tevreden met ons spel we hebben heel volwassen gespeeld maar ik ben totaal ontevreden over de strafcorners we hebben er al duizenden getraind en normaal missen we amper stops maar hier hebben we er 3 of 4 gemist dat is heel frustrerend maar we werken eraan de spelers in kwestie zijn daar natuurlijk ook ontgoocheld over maar er zijn al enkele teams die problemen hebben op dit veld om de bal te stoppen we hebben in de recente wedstrijden nu 5 punten gepakt tegen duitsland nadat we daarvoor 28 jaar op rij hadden verloren hopelijk kunnen we binnenkort ook de negatieve trend tegen andere topteams ombuigen
3739129 we hebben heel zwaar gewerkt in deze partij gewerkt als een team in de tweede helft waren we fysiek beter dan de duitsers we hebben in het begin wat geluk gehad maar in de tweede helft kenden we ook enkele keren malchance tegen spanje in de eerste wedstrijd zat alles goed vast maar bij de duitsers was het tactisch minder compact een punt gehaald uit de eerste twee wedstrijden tegen de twee zwaarste tegenstanders dat is wat we wilden
3739130 nu nog winnen van nieuw zeeland en dan hebben we misschien zelfs nog kans op de top 2 in de poule al droom ik nu misschien een beetje te veel het duel tegen nieuw zeeland wordt heel moeilijk vooral fysiek het wordt een belangrijke wedstrijd al die belgische supporters hier gaven me wel kippenvel en ook de nederlanders supporterden voor ons
3739131 dit is een geweldige prestatie in de tweede helft waren we veel beter vooral fysiek wij hadden de betere kansen het is vreemd om dat te zeggen na een wedstrijd tegen de wereldkampioen maar we zijn zelfs een beetje gefrustreerd dat we hier slechts n punt uit halen als we dit niveau kunnen aanhouden in de andere wedstrijden dan kunnen we nog een mooie prestatie neerzetten in dit toernooi we verbeteren alsmaar

3739149 we roeiden wellicht onze beste race van dit seizoen dat we niet in de a finale geraken ligt vooral aan de kracht van de tegenstanders
3739150 we versloegen voor het eerst dit seizoen de duitsers wenzel borwoski wat nog maar eens bewijst dat we groeien in dit toernooi tenslotte finishen we hier op amper drie seconden van de regerende wereldkampioenen cop spik de slovenen die in athene zilver veroverden en sedertdien op elk wk niet meer uit de top twee weg te slaan waren
3739151 morgen wacht ons de b finale de strijd om de zevende tot de twaalfde plaats voldoende snel recupereren en knokken voor een plaats bij de eerste twee lees de top acht want dat resultaat kan ons niet alleen een olympisch diploma opleveren het is ook de norm die we moeten halen om ons topsportcontract te kunnen verlengen

3739154 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3739176 in other words it appears that russia suddenly belongs to the elite club of countries that can write their own rules
3739177 having established the precedent of defending russian citizens by the use of military force the kremlin could put the same divide and rule techniques to use in crimea the province of ukraine that is dominated by ethnic russians in ethnically russian northern kazakhstan or in baltic states with large russian minorities

3739204 it takes a lot of balls to golf the way you do
3739205 letting him go for the money we did has nothing to do with him having just one year on his contract
3739206 he didnt want to be here and we have to consider that every player has a realistic market value
3739207 nicky has been consistent in his thought process for 15 months that he wanted to leave
3739208 this time last year he had just won two england caps against brazil and germany and i am amazed that no one came in for him before that
3739209 west ham offered 3million that was very inadequate if you consider that nicky was then first choice for the england left back spot and leighton baines had just gone from wigan to everton for 6 5m
3739210 that would be hypothetical to guess but i am satisfied that the squad have bonded and the common goal is to get us promoted
3739211 we want people to have the chance to be part of an event gaining national recognition i like to think that we give anyone the confidence to have a go

3739215 i am not certain of my team yet as we have a few knocks but noel should play
3739216 he wasnt on the bench on sunday because i chose just one striker and shane long had done nothing wrong
3739217 but noel has had a good pre season hes settled in well and now its just a question of earning himself the respect of the squad and the coaching staff
3739218 we all have something to prove to ourselves he is undoubtedly a good player his goal record proves that and its down to him now if he gets his chance
3739219 they have had the same manager john still for a few years and they know what they are doing it is an uncomfortable little ground and wont be easy

3739223 we settled into what became a 62 mile three up time trial and eventually gained a lead of over four minutes on the peloton
3739224 with two miles remaining we started not co operating all aiming for the win
3739225 at 500 metres to go there was a dig from one of the other riders i got on his wheel but then the eventual winner came from behind and i had no power left to chase
3739226 i finished third but was very happy as we had managed to stay away from a very active chasing peloton
3739227 i worked hard to be in the right place to win sprints and then had some luck which allowed me to take a lap between the second and third sprints

3739235 when i began my career in public service i promised myself that i would not become a politician someone who allows public office to determine the direction of his life
3739236 at half time in my service in the house i looked ahead to the next two years and realized that it would not be possible to maintain the pace i set during the past four years while our constitution envisions a part time citizen legislature for those of us interested in mastering public policy issues and making important lasting change the house quickly becomes a full time job i have concluded that i will not be able to do the kind of job i expect of myself the kind of job the people of tampa bay expect and deserve while also fulfilling my paramount responsibilities as a husband and father as the president of a growing health care business and as an officer in the united states navy reserve as a result the only right decision is for me to step aside and allow someone else to serve the people of tampa bay
3739237 it has been a privilege to put my heart and soul into my legislative work over the last four years until this year i have been blessed to be able to bring my family with me to tallahassee and that they have shared this remarkable experience with me has enriched my service in the house however as my elementary school aged children grow and the business opportunities i pursue on their behalf expand i must focus all my energies on these priorities and walk away
3739238 the solution to our problems isnt going to come from tallahassee or washington it is going to come from our communities
3739239 we have to energize and mobilize not just public resources but the financial commercial educational religious and civic resources of the greater tampa bay area
3739240 i am proud of what i have been able to be a part of in public service i am grateful beyond words to the many many people who contributed to those accomplishments

3739248 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3739249 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3739250 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3739251 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3739252 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3739253 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3739254 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3739255 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3739256 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3739257 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3739258 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3739259 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3739260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3739261 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3739271 what this says to me is that more than 1 in 4 000 people have mitochondrial disease
3739272 and it tells me that 1 in 200 could develop some type of mitochondria related disease over the course of their lifetime depending in part on environmental triggers
3739273 the core of many well known diseases and chronic illnesses such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease and autism spectrum disorders
3739274 mitochondrial dysfunction represents a major unexplored area of human biology of vital importance to human health
3739275 while it cannot yet be said that mitochondrial dysfunction causes these problems it is clear that mitochondria are involved because their function is measurably disturbed
3739276 mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3739277 we have always advocated spreading the immunizations out as much as possible because every time you vaccinate you are creating a challenge for the system
3739278 and if a child has an impaired system that could in fact trigger further clinical problems
3739279 we do not know what is safe we do not know what is not safe we do not know the actual risk of a person with light mitochondrial disease has and being challenged either by vaccination or by a severe infection
3739280 is there a relationship between mitochondrial disease and vaccination and mitochondrial disease and autism
3739281 would a vaccination or infection initiate an incipient mitochondrial disease as has been suggested
3739282 this will help us educate key members of congress to motivate and encourage nih to appropriate more funds to focus specifically on mitochondrial dysfunction and disease
3739283 we would like to see this result in a better understanding of the links between energy metabolism and what we call the
3739284 you must know that this is going to come out

3739304 i played very well last week and i dont think he played particularly well the courts there give higher bounces a little bit slower which benefited me a little bit i had a little more time on the forehand i come in here with not much practice time
3739305 having gone in 04 and medal ling especially in medal ling made my decision a little easier i thought it was nice to stay close to home and play a few tournaments that i enjoy playing here
3739306 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3739307 i never played well there it was my decision it could be my mistake or i was right or wrong i dont know but i made it
3739308 yeah it was just a mental error i just played sloppy im just gonna have to bear down mentally from here on up
3739309 i really enjoy it here one of my first good memories is here in 2000 i ended up in the quarter finals and i think i was 17 and got to play andre out there and beat a couple of good top twenty players that week which was huge for me at the time i dont even know if i was ranked in the top 300 as soon as you get back on a court youve had success on you feel good right away
3739310 it definitely wasnt an easy decision and i said i could easily look back and realize that it could be the wrong one it was purely from a tennis standpoint and what i thought would prepare me best for the us open of course i miss being there and of course when im watching the opening cermonies im thinking about it i knew that making that decision there was almost going to be a certainty that parts of me was going to regret it and obviously thats happened a little bit

3739317 weve done worse things than take a piss on a bus
3739318 they got rid of counties when they got rid of kings
3739319 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3739320 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
3739321 i think no one will reach that in the next one or two years and when someone does i will create more records
3739322 it is a lot of racing and its not easy the next ones are pretty important
3739323 map my tracks is the easy way to accurately track your outdoor activity jogging cycling sailing using your own mobile phone your tracks can be shared in real time on the web map my tracks uses a mobile phone and gps to track your location and lets you broadcast it live on the web for friends family or coaches who can watch your progress
3739324 map my tracks turns a mobile phone into a personal gps tracking device it uses a mobile phones data connection to update your location online which in turn shows viewers where you are right now it can be used with gps enabled phones or by using an external gps receiver that is connected to a phone by bluetooth on top of that we provide a wealth of analytical data that lets you understand how you have performed
3739325 there are two main revenue streams a monthly subscription service and event tracking the subscription service is free for under one hour of tracking each month of 5 99 per month for a pro account the event tracking service provides event or race organisers with a facility to track all the competitors in a race and broadcasts a birds eye view of the action live over the web
3739326 after just six months we already have thousands of people using map my tracks in over 70 countries
3739327 i started out in business running a design company making furniture long before the web was a reality after merging this with another company i founded in 1999 which provided online financial news and was subsequently sold to an investment bank in 2003 i founded tinderhouse a web development company which is the parent company for map my tracks
3739328 we have competitors for some of our services but not all as a pure personal sports tracking application we are up against but the events tracking sector is quite fragmented at the moment with no real competitors providing the real time tracking using mobile phones
3739329 choosing where to invest our development time is a real challenge right now there is a huge range of mobile phones on the market each with different operating systems like iphone
3739330 without a doubt the most surreal is finding myself dressed in a tudor outfit while testing our event tracking system for a traditional rowing event along the river thames the race that we were tracking needed a volunteer passenger on one of the boats
3739331 i dont think so but these are exciting times having been part of the dot com bubble in 2000 i think the web industry is far more mature right now especially in the mobile sector which is seeing a lot of investment that is driving development
3739332 we want to be at the forefront of sports events tracking in five years we want map my tracks to be the standard for sports event tracking covering events all around the globe
3739333 we are confident that we will have something quite good to announce in the next couple of months
3739334 weve just done another round of seed finance from senior figures in the financial community and the music community and we wouldnt have been able to do that if we didnt think there was good news coming down the pipe were starting the process of principal finance were looking for about 4 million it takes us through to profitability because it will essentially finance this first large isp deal
3739335 this is a very slow business i can tell you but i havent been working on this for five years to decide not to prove the model at the last minute this is new territory for isps and the music industry
3739336 if some things that we know are happening come to fruition then we should see a breakthrough early next year its not rocket science give em what they want ask them to pay for it
3739337 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3739338 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3739339 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3739340 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community
3739341 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3739342 this goes a long way to help those survivors in their recovery
3739343 after all these years burying it deep inside suicide attempts i know that is wasnt my fault
3739344 i now can have a life without the fear and shame that surrounds the abuse that we victims have gone through
3739345 the best way i can express this is you never get over this you get used to it
3739346 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3739347 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3739348 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3739349 its appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3739350 cica makes decisions on conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them in each individual case and any applicants unhappy with the decision in their claim can ask for a review by a more senior member of staff
3739351 although i cannot comment on the individual decisions of the criminal injuries compensation authority i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption

3739387 requiere de los ciudadanos verdaderos protagonistas de la circulaci n la m xima responsabilidad con el objeto de conseguir que estas fiestas lo sean de verdad para todos
3739388 hecho que no ha impedido que la tasa interanual en la provincia alcance ya un incremento del 5 7 por ciento cuatro d cimas m s que la media espa ola y cinco por encima de la que hay en la comunitat valenciana
3739389 un constante incremento de la inflaci n que repercute de forma negativa en los bolsillos de los trabajadores
3739390 que el gobierno realice un mayor esfuerzo para controlar los precios con el objetivo de reducir la inflaci n
3739391 a la creaci n de herramientas que eviten un aumento injustificado del precio de los productos desde el origen al destino que eliminen posibles trabas a la competencia sobre todo en algunos sectores con capacidad para pactar precios e incrementar sus m rgenes de beneficio
3739392 situaci n de crisis que ven a gest ndose dentro de coag desde hace ya muchos a os
3739393 en la m s absoluta indefensi n para llevar a cabo la defensa de los intereses de los agricultores valencianos ante cualquier problema estatal o europeo
3739394 a n no han tomado esta decisi n pero suponemos que la tomar n
3739395 desde hace varios a os se viene sucediendo la presencia de coches de autoescuelas en las calles de la carrera de malilla ingeniero joaqu n benlloch olt juan ram n jim nez bernal descoll pianista amparo iturbi bernardo morales mart n y adyacentes
3739396 redunda en que en la actualidad la barriada del sur de la ciudad con 22 000 habitantes se ha convertido en una autentica pista de ensayo para alumnos que desean obtener el permiso de conducir
3739397 ante posibles accidentes que se vienen sucediendo o se han sucedido
3739398 han venido circulando coches de autoescuelas de todos los puntos de valencia incluso de autoescuelas de los pueblos cercanos a la capital ya que sus calles forman parte de una de las zonas destinadas a los ex menes pr cticos del carn de conducir desde hace tiempo
3739399 en la actualidad es frecuente la acumulaci n de hasta seis y siete coches seguidos igualmente resulta frecuente la presencia de camiones de pr cticas de gran tonelaje llevando incluso remolque as como autobuses conducidos por alumnos aspirantes al carn de conducir
3739400 a n siendo grave en s misma ha venido colmando la paciencia de vecinos ya que en este barrio la red escolar coincide con estas calles por donde discurre el circuito de autoescuelas
3739401 se ha visto agravada y ha sido ca tica al coincidir el tr nsito de coches en pr cticas con las obras de actualizaci n y acondicionamiento de colectores en la v a principal carrera de malilla reduci ndose el tr fico de cuatro carriles dos en cada sentido a s lo dos uno por sentido
3739402 durante este tiempo pese a las protestas vecinales la concejal a de tr fico no ha hecho absolutamente nada
3739403 a las quejas vecinales se han sumado las remitidas por las ampas y las direcciones de los distintos colegios e ies a la alcaldesa y la concejal a correspondiente y que como tales constan en el registro de entrada del consistorio
3739404 est todo muy amarrado y controlado y todav a se va a poder ver en los 10 d as que faltan
3739405 todo el mundo nos hemos puesto las pilas y estamos trabajando
3739406 vamos a dar una imagen de pa s absolutamente positiva
3739407 lo mejor es que hab a una voluntad pol tica de solucionarlo y sab amos c mo por lo que me preocupaba relativamente
3739408 la imagen que podemos dar como pa s y del gran premio de europa
3739409 causar las menores molestias posibles a los ciudadanos de valencia
3739410 sinceramente si fuera valenciano me sentir a muy satisfecho y muy orgulloso de tener un gran premio de f1 en valencia
3739411 evidentemente hab a problemas de juventud pero eso lo tenemos tambi n si fuera una instalaci n permanente
3739412 nuestro inter s era hacer una carrera de ensayo antes para que se detectaran esos problemas
3739413 est n trabajando con el tiempo suficiente para que la pista est dispuesta para el jueves que empezar n a rodar los coches
3739414 es la m s alta desde 1995 y lamentablemente seguir batiendo nuevos r cords en los pr ximos meses si el ejecutivo de zapatero no aplica unas medidas eficaces que erradiquen la subida de los precios
3739415 como las contempladas en el las nuevas medidas de impulso de la econom a valenciana 2008 2009 aprobadas recientemente por el consell
3739416 es necesario el apoyo de la pol tica econ mica estatal para combatir las elevas tasas de inflaci n actuales

3739419 el ministro de econom a afirm durante la pasada campa a electoral que la inflaci n alcanzar a su m ximo en el mes de marzo para posteriormente moderarse y acercarse al objetivo inicial los datos de julio reflejan que esta previsi n ha sido err nea provocando una vez m s la p rdida de la credibilidad del gobierno de zapatero
3739420 ahora argumenta que una de las causas de este nuevo repunte de la inflaci n es el incremento de la tarifa el ctrica cuando desde el consell ya le avisamos de que esta subida no favorec a el control de la inflaci n de cara a los pr ximos meses
3739421 la elevada inflaci n que estamos alcanzando ya es un problema estructural
3739422 se trata para espa a del registro m s elevado desde diciembre de 2002 indicando por tanto que el incremento de precios de las materias primas se est trasladando progresivamente al n cleo central de la estructura de bienes de la econom a
3739423 ha suspendido la asignatura de la inflaci n y con el camino que lleva tampoco aprobar en septiembre su problema es que no es conciente de las consecuencias para el futuro m s inmediato de la econom a valenciana y la espa ola como la p rdida de poder adquisitivo de las familias desincentivaci n del ahorro y p rdida de competitividad que penalizan a nuestras exportaciones
3739424 la gran labor efectuada por todos los operativos de emergencias que han demostrado una gran eficacia en la coordinaci n y distribuci n de medios a reos y terrestres

3739433 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3739434 i know a little bit about his character and everything is as advertised it is evidenced by the way his teams have played that he is very structured in the defensive zone
3739435 if you take a close look at what scott has done with young players at providence you dont have that kind of success without patience
3739436 i just felt he was the best fit for our organization just because youre in the nhl doesnt mean youre done developing scott has a track record of developing young players

3739468 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3739469 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3739470 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3739471 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3739472 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3739473 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3739474 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3739475 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
3739476 its difficult to believe that the idf took the necessary precautions to avoid causing harm to civilians as it is obliged to do under international law
3739477 yo if you were a guy with one leg youd be a happy man theyre all lefts
3739478 use of the flechette is restricted to areas in which the danger to innocent civilians is not actual

3739481 the eu is ready to engage including on the ground to support the efforts of the united nations and the osce
3739482 definitely european monitors have to be on the ground europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3739483 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3739484 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3739485 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues
3739486 i see no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3739487 you can decide to make strong statements with one sided condemnations or you can look to the future and take a real role in stabilizing the situation
3739488 i have discussed all aspects of this unfortunate incident and have decided to appoint an immediate inquiry

3739502 it sounded a bit odd but also worked well the email was reasonable cdn 120 contract per month for 2 hours of usage which generally was all i needed the catch is images pictures or graphics they take hours to download so you just can not receive them

3739546 a level results day is a stressful time rather than rush into a decision about going to university students should invest the time in re evaluating the many paths to success including vocational courses and apprenticeships
3739547 practical learning is increasingly important in the workplace and is a genuine alternative to an academic university degree which can lead to a successful high achieving career
3739548 when i found out my grades i called up uwe and spoke to a member of staff after about 10 seconds i was accepted on the course i wanted and now i have proved myself with getting very good grades for my work
3739549 clearing may not be a place you would like to be the feeling of not knowing whether you have been accepted is nail biting
3739550 if you do find yourself in this situation try to stay focused calm and look at the different options open to you it is not the end of the world and you still have plenty of time and chances to work hard
3739551 clearing can be a stressful time for students and their families but its important to relax and not to panic
3739552 our advisors are on hand to guide students through the whole process and help them make an informed decision
3739553 preventing hasty youngsters from rushing into courses which many will simply give up or not find useful to find a future career
3739554 constructive well planned and executed gap years more often than not based around a year spent gaining focused work experience stick out like the proverbial sore thumb amongst the thousands of bland identical clone like applications
3739555 academic achievements and social background are irrelevant hungry motivated graduates full of life skills most notably initiative communication and decision making skills are the gold we employers now mine for
3739556 now to be the most decorated olympian of all time i have nothing to say
3739557 i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3739558 i think no one will reach those records in the next one to two years and when someone does i will create more new records
3739559 this gold can encourage more kids to enjoy gymnastics i believe that for the coming years chinese gymnastics would become better and better
3739560 the average person can concentrate on a few good companies while the fund manager is forced to diversify by owning too many stocks you lose this advantage of concentration it only takes a handful of big winners to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile

3739626 nay but their hearts were covered over by what sins they earned
3739627 it is because of doing one sin after another until the heart becomes blind and dies
3739628 it is because of doing one sin after another one sin after another until the heart dies and becomes black
3739629 their sins overcome their hearts until no good can get through to them
3739630 they used to consider the heart like a hand when a person sins his heart starts to scrunch up

3739636 we dont believe for example that launching the gold futures will substantially generate revenues to the exchange and also the introduction of certified emission products in the middle of 2009 will substantially change the revenue stream of the hkex so what were doing is taking a longer term view
3739637 they should have an enterprise wide risk management programme that would include an annual risk assessment of the risks associated with the business and they should categorise all their risks whether they are high risk medium or low risk and develop responses to address each of these risks particularly those that are of high risk to the organisation
3739638 risk management ought to be part of the culture the dna of an organisation in fact it is important for the ceo to set the right tone from the top and ensure that everyone within the organisation embrace the concept of good risk management and strong ethical behaviour within the organisation

3739688 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3739689 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3739690 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3739691 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3739692 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3739693 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3739694 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3739695 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3739696 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3739697 i think that these sorts of discussions which bring together philosophers neuroscientists biologists and ecologists that try to analyse the fundamental issues in these areas using philosophical tools are very important if we are going to understand what the science is telling us
3739698 i think the conclusions of the papers that have been presented here are much more nuanced than just the broad claim that conscious will is an illusion some of the papers were trying to make room for a concept of free will that is larger than something measured in milliseconds even if it is just a sense that we have some control over the way we are doing something or acting
3739699 despite certain interpretations of the neuroscience this is something at a very pragmatic and personal level which we need to think about and for which we need to find some kind of explanation
3739700 i think one of the overarching things going on here is we are trying to work out what it is we should be talking about when we try to talk about conscious experience
3739701 the kinds of conversations we have had here have been very unusual because people from very different disciplines kind of felt that they understood what the others cared about and if we can get that it might not be a common territory but it is a pretty big condition for it
3739702 the government does not want to see a slump in the car market the policy is just a symbolic gesture to raise public awareness in a high oil price year
3739703 if china decides to raise prices by another 1 500 yuan per tonne to close the gap with international markets oil could hit 90 if china tops that with fuel tax oil could dive to 70 80

3739723 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3739724 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3739725 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3739787 amendments to the ontario energy efficiency act have established minimum efficiencies in 50 product categories that consume 80 per cent of residential energy consumption and 50 per cent of commercial usage

3739790 weve done the easy stuff so were going to have to dig deeper
3739791 it was the right thing to do but it was a difficult decision to make because of the supply deficit that has ensued and that were trying really hard to remedy right now

3739793 up until now refinery capacity has barely kept up with demand

3739796 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them

3739798 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3739799 we think our troops are being well served if they have the misfortune of being wounded in terms of evacuation and immediate medical care
3739800 were unhappy with what happens when you come home and thats a much larger problem
3739801 it has to do with the uneven nature of medicare in canada and how some provinces seem to excel at it and other provinces dont provide the same quality of it
3739802 but its fundamentally unfair to push the wounded soldiers and already over stressed families onto an already overburdened civilian health care system
3739803 there has to be some sort of inclusion for the long term care costs of rehabilitation and psychological care for the soldiers when theyre in uniform and when they come out of uniform
3739804 the federal government should ensure there are regional centers at a minimum that would provide for the care and the rehabilitiation
3739805 developing centres of excellence on cf bases affiliated with nearby civilian providers
3739806 some injuries which are more of a psychological or mental nature might manifest themselves six months later or eight months later and your regimental family is too far from you to help and that was a great concern that we had
3739807 we call upon the nation to observe three days of mourning and hold peaceful demonstrations
3739808 we have not found evidence that links it to the beijing olympics but we continue to make efforts to find out the truth
3739809 i hope citizens receiving this message will not take bus routes 54 64 and 84 tomorrow morning
3739810 the japanese did a study on him took him into a scientific lab and broke down all of his anatomy
3739811 it showed that the wing span is 203 centimetres and his height is 193 centimetres usually height matches arm length so hes already got this extra reach
3739812 then his shoe size is 14 where most are 12 at most and that gives him an extra 10 per cent efficiency everything about him physically is stacked in his favour
3739813 so where most people do a dolphin kick and try to kick from the ribs he can do it all the way from the chest which in this case gives him 20 efficiency thats why you see him stay under water so long and why it is so easy when he comes up
3739814 for him all that is pretty effortless and then hes got that energy to continue swimming on top of the water
3739815 when spitz did it there were maybe five or six countries that had the sort of sophisticated programs we see from all over the world today
3739816 that he has the depth and capacity to do it in so many kinds of events spitz was basically freestyle and butterfly is amazing
3739817 usually you cant breaststroke to save your life if you are a freestyler
3739818 they have destroyed buildings there has been looting by russian troops they were shooting people
3739819 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3739820 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3739821 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3739822 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3739823 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3739824 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3739825 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3739826 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by president dmitry medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3739827 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3739828 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3739829 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3739830 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3739831 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3739832 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3739833 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3739834 someone from our amazing top 6 is heading home this week
3739835 mitch theo and mookie you are all safe that means that earl amberly and drew you are tonights bottom 3
3739836 canada voted and the idol who received the fewest number of votes last night and is going home is amberly
3739837 alright canada youve got a top 5 and the idol mansion has become a frat house
3739838 yeah i think overall we have probably the most interesting top 5 weve ever had and probably the best musicians of any top 5 weve ever had
3739839 well its simple the same effort and dedication you put into this you take onto the next thing when you first auditioned for canadian idol you werent thinking this was my only shot in the world so you go out and do the next thing with the same effort same desires and same passion
3739840 i think one thing we havent seen yet and that is really important in the five is true spectacle weve had great singing great interpretations of songs but i dont think weve seen anybody do something completely radically visually outrageous and i think thats important
3739841 well actually our canadian tour starts in seven days starts on the 19th in st johns newfoundland and we go all across the country so check out the website
3739842 it was kind of weird at first we were a little bit nervous because we didnt know if we could do a good job of it but after earl went through we talked to the rest of the guys it was really easy they were all really nice and it just felt comfortable it was just a good time
3739843 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3739844 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3739845 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3739846 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3739847 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3739848 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3739849 were representing peterborough and we want to make peterborough proud
3739850 its going to be fun because were going to get to meet other teams like baseball teams and girls field lacrosse it will be fun to see all these different athletes
3739851 because this team since ive been playing for it hasnt made it to provincials we want to show everybody we belong there
3739852 its a different atmosphere you get that olympic feeling with opening ceremonies
3739853 you get bused back and forth to the games and you stay in a college away from your parents its exciting
3739854 we have a good chance to compete because our boys want to compete
3739855 weve pulled off victories we hadnt done before against whitby halton hills and six nations i think that builds confidence they know if they go out and work hard and outwork the other teams anything is possible
3739856 you never get to do it again so you have to do your best and hopefully come out with at least a medal
3739857 we can beat any team in the province if we come to play
3739858 seven games in three days will be rough but if we get our sleep at night we should be fine
3739859 thats why at the start of the year we went with 18 runners and two goalies were a fast team and like to move the ball and move our feet we have to have the runners to play the game we play especially with three games in one day endurance is going to have to be there
3739860 i dont think anyone could say with certainty that under english law it will be rock solid for ever
3739861 the decision is hard on chambers but essential for athletics and sport in general
3739862 many people both inside and outside sport would see this by law as unlawful
3739863 but in my judgment it would take a much better case than the claimant has presented to persuade me to overturn the status quo at this stage and compel his selection for the games
3739864 there might have been different results and outcomes had the timetable been different
3739865 in hindsight maybe dwain chambers was poorly advised waiting until he had secured the qualifying time to then bring his case which compressed it into a very short timeframe
3739866 it isnt a black and white situation if the issue gets re opened in the future it will undoubtedly take up a lot of the boas time all over again but in a different way
3739867 uk athletics values the by law very highly but a court of law is different to the opinion of a sports governing body
3739868 i had my doubts as to whether it would stand in court but i see that it does and that is encouraging
3739869 we do not wish to see deliberate cheats participating again in the olympic games and the ioc has already taken some steps in introducing new rules
3739870 there are rules and regulations in life we have to abide to but sometimes i feel that forgiveness is one of those things that weve got to look into
3739871 ok he cant go to the olympics but i think the sport has to rehabilitate him
3739872 yes and i think thats what they need to use him as an ambassador for the sport
3739873 go out there to the kids in the community and say listen this is whats happened to me i made mistakes and sometimes your mistakes come back and bite you in the bum so dont do the same as i did
3739874 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3739875 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3739876 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3739877 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3739878 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3739879 und man geht nicht einfach so zu den spielen nicht wenn man der ist der ich bin
3739880 sie ist meine mama sie mag mich mit und ohne bart

3739883 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3739884 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3739885 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3739886 i play this director who is drowning in this monolithic beast of a hollywood production and the comedy springs from my misfortunes
3739887 the film starts out looking like a big hollywood war movie and then quickly becomes a high concept comedy
3739888 is ben stiller saying cut or is the character saying cut

3739890 web 2 0 trends and stats separating the hype from reality
3739891 10 things your network performance management system must do this bit of knowledge is the key to the systems long term success each of the 10 features is spelled out in detail
3739892 the russians are encroaching upon the capital they are making a circle
3739893 we will protect our capital until the last drop of our blood
3739894 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3739895 well frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft russians dont understand that kind of soft language
3739896 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3739897 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3739898 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3739899 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3739900 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3739901 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3739902 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3739903 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
3739904 we have now been able to protect the beach so we dont see that happen
3739905 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3739906 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3739907 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3739908 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3739909 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3739910 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3739911 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game

3739955 good it is true that most western progressive countries those who have been governed for centuries by the rule of law have abolished the death penalty even for serious crimes like treason murder and rape
3739956 we do not execute rapists in the hopes perhaps that they will be reformed or perhaps only on the grounds that it is simply wrong to kill even to kill a dangerous criminal
3739957 now lets examine a country that does have it communist china has more capital offenses brief pause to explain the terms communist and capital offense than any other country in the world and they carry out more executions than any other country even than the united states
3739958 let us pretend for a moment that you are an official of chinas legal system charged with carrying out executions would you consider granting clemency to a rapist

3739960 the russians are encroaching upon the capital they are making a circle
3739961 we will protect our capital until the last drop of our blood
3739962 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3739963 well frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft russians dont understand that kind of soft language

3739966 thanks again to all of you who are talking this up and keeping the buzz alive also thank you for your patience we just want it to sound amazing when you finally hear it
3739967 but things are definitely not as good as i thought it would be
3739968 i love the olympics i like any event where the chinese could win a gold medal
3739969 thats the nature of these sports venues nearly anywhere in the world
3739970 they are completely distinct walled off by parking lots and have almost nothing to do with their environments
3739971 i moved here because they turned my last house into a subway stop because of the olympics
3739972 there were thousands of people living there we all had to leave

3739978 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3739979 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3739980 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3739981 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3739982 so coverage of athletes and gold medal face offs are acceptable but stories about pro tibet protests even on the edge of the main olympic venues are off limits
3739983 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics
3739984 chinese authorities have been particularly sensitive about tibet since bloody anti government protests in march in the regions capital and surrounding provinces
3739985 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
3739986 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
3739987 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
3739988 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
3739989 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
3739990 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate
3739991 this investment into emerging technologis is paying off in delivering state of the art science support
3739992 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible

3739994 he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
3739995 weve heard a lot of great things about green man from friends who live in the uk
3739996 its a small little festival thats off the beaten track and isnt at all like reading or leeds some of the big ones can be a bit intimidating so its going to be really nice to be far out in the countryside for a festival
3739997 we enjoy it thats for sure its fun to prove yourself if you want to and really people have come along just to enjoy whatever music is being played we enjoy that challenge but at the same time i guess when given a choice its always nicer to play your own shows
3739998 we really like to hang around but for how long depends on our schedule if were there for a while we love to check stuff out and get the feel for the place we played a festival in
3739999 we met iron and wine at all tomorrows parties at minehead earlier this year when we played on the same day as them they told us about this welsh festival and as we were in the middle of stringing a few dates together we thought we would love to play there were looking forward to seeing them again at green man
