8240010 with inflation doggedly remaining high the question remains will europe enter stagflation stagnation plus high inflation or even worse a genuine recession
8240011 while germany and to a lesser extent france are likely to show some resilience thanks to strong fundamentals the spanish economy is bound to experience at least two quarters of negative growth which would qualify it as being in a technical recession

8240029 im incredibly honored to be a part of this film
8240030 it is the kind of film that when you walk out really makes you want to go out and be proactive
8240031 the global economic system up until seattle made rich people richer and poor people poorer

8240037 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8240038 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8240039 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week
8240040 we are delighted to have reached an agreement with hearts and very pleased that a player of calum elliots quality is coming to the club
8240041 i am certain that he will prove a valuable addition to our pool of players
8240042 its not been much fun over the past few weeks i got over the stomach problem but then the achilles flared up
8240043 most of us would have liked to see him poulter qualifying
8240044 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there

8240058 grampian may not have the same level of knife related crime as some other parts of the country but it is important that we get the message out that aggressive and violent behaviour has no place on the north easts streets and the carrying of weapons will not be tolerated in any shape or form

8240072 die m glichkeit dass diese schadstoffe in ein zwei oder dreihundert jahren freigesetzt werden k nnten ist viel gr er als bisher angenommen
8240073 dieser problematik ist bisher viel zu wenig aufmerksamkeit geschenkt worden das muss sich dringend ndern

8240124 that is unless you live in apartment 3l at 1254 holden st you watched money train on tbs last night at 3 a m and your name is nate walsh
8240125 i have always said that the change we seek will not come easy that it will not come without its share of sacrifice and struggle
8240126 and the last thing we need is dead weight like nate walsh adding another 20 or 30 years to the process
8240127 when i began this campaign my mission was to help this nation share my vision for one america not a black america or a white america or a latino or asian america
8240128 but now what i see what i envision is a nate free america and once we get rid of that guy there is nothing we cant accomplish nothing we cant achieve
8240129 i am reminded of an instance early last year when nate told his sister elizabeth that he was going to start going to the gym three times a week after work
8240130 i was rooting for nate i thought that this time things would be different that this time nate would be capable of change but it was just like 1997 1999 2000 and 2002 all over again he went to the gym twice and quit
8240131 people of america not nate we have the ability to heal this nation
8240132 yes we can nate excluded seize our future yes we can with the exception of nate and his stupid cargo shorts that he never washes turn the page to a new tomorrow i am confident that where we and by we i mean everyone but nate are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we cant we again not nate will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the american people in six simple words yes we can except nate walsh

8240148 im a bad liberal and people freak out when they discover i have five kids however they forget that while big families make bigger messes they also have more actual people to clean up said messes so heres how we do it i have a chart that hangs where everyone can see it its pretty basic everyone has two chores a day on the chart as well as cleaning up their room they all share rooms so they each have to clean up their own junk i chose a number of chores and grouped them so that no one does the same chore on the chart more than once a week we have a swivel sweeper which is cordless and very easy for the kids to use i have my homemade all purpose cleaner vinegar and water that they use for cleaning solid surfaces every weekday both of our eating on tables get cleaned the litter box gets scooped each bathroom gets the counters sinks and toilets cleaned and trash emptied the swivel sweeper gets run over the areas where we eat the kitchen the hallway and the living room quite so impressive and no independence quite so important as living within your means

8240216 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8240217 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8240218 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8240219 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8240220 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8240221 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8240222 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8240223 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8240224 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8240225 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8240226 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8240227 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8240228 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8240229 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
8240230 la discipline de son lectorat et de son appareil militant
8240231 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8240232 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8240233 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8240234 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8240235 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8240236 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
8240237 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8240238 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8240239 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8240240 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8240241 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8240242 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8240243 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8240244 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8240245 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8240246 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8240247 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8240248 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8240249 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8240250 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8240251 i would not want to walk without sidewalks and with cars flying by
8240252 it has nothing to do whatsoever with race it has to do with the expense
8240253 its not as cut and dry as it may seem
8240254 i had to go back to working nights because there was nobody to pick my kids up
8240255 the school is not concerned with what were going through
8240256 they could care less whether we come to school at all
8240257 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
8240258 you know that we dont panic here you hit the panic button it just gets worse right right
8240259 its not like ice skating where you know what routine is going to come its always going to be something different every game hopefully we can keep finding different ways to win
8240260 that was a spot where one pitch could turn the game around it was the best scenario for us one pitch got two outs
8240261 youve got to remember i went from zero to famous and i had no experience
8240262 all of a sudden i was the expletive queen across the nation i was not prepared for that
8240263 i didnt know what to expect or how i would feel
8240264 i didnt know if i could possibly remember any of my songs the rare ones from guyville that i dont play live a lot
8240265 i wasnt sure i could do it because im not that age anymore we all move on but on stage i realized everybody gets that theyre not the same age either
8240266 i pull it out from them before it gets too produced
8240267 i was just like umm nope im saying no to a lot of people
8240268 i wont go into the vast differences between john mccain and barrack obama on policies or philosophies but want to simply look at this from a tactics point of view
8240269 why are we losing elections and the hearts of the people
8240270 i can confirm we have no current plans to re enter the uk market
8240271 the successful collaboration between terremark and cisco has extended to europe and the expansion of our infinistructure platform will help to meet the growing needs of our customers on both sides of the about virtualization news desk

8240276 yes i will put all my energy at the service of my beliefs
8240277 would not my intervention help even if only in a small way to lighten the burden of secrecy borne by so many people
8240278 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8240279 we believe that the actions of the contract security guard were inappropriate and unacceptable we have notified his company paragon of our position in the matter
8240280 in 30 years as an activist this is one of the most unsettling things i have seen when she called me i told her to wait right there
8240281 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
8240282 means mccain would run a campaign without a core constituency of the republican party
8240283 i think there would be a walkout on lieberman at the convention hes not a republican
8240284 if this election is going to be as close as the polls indicate joe biden doesnt change the map at all
8240285 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
8240286 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
8240287 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
8240288 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates
8240289 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
8240290 he saw that when we were doing fund raisers in the rush campaign his appeal to quite frankly young white professionals was dramatic
8240291 ils y viennent tous la prise de conscience que ce nest pas la mort qui d termine que lon puisse pr lever des organes le tour de passe passe est en train de saccomplir on oublie que pendant quarante ans on nous a serin que cest parce que les gens taient morts que lon pouvait pr lever dans ma th se transplantation dorganes et thique chr tienne en 1992 j crivais que c tait une erreur de raisonnement de base de mettre une galit entre quelquun qui est mort et quelquun qui va mourir
8240292 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there
8240293 but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8240294 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8240295 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8240296 we talked about if two months from now he could really still do it
8240297 if he couldnt play at that 110 percent level that he had always played at he wasnt going to play but he was flattered and happy to have the opportunity to talk about it
8240298 if michaels heart is in the right spot and he truly wants and has the desire to play then without a doubt
8240299 if his hearts in it and he wants to come back and play football
8240300 obviously hes made a decision that he wants to retire we just have to see if thats changed in the last several months
8240301 watching guys try to turn it back on its been a struggle for them but michael strahan is a different breed if there is somebody who can do it he can probably do it but i dont know if its in his best interest
8240302 the most important thing to me is getting us ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8240303 i really look at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8240304 he went in there and was really put behind the eight ball with that first drive
8240305 he somehow got a first down there drove them down the field and converted two fourth downs what im seeing more out of kellen is the patience in the pocket the ability to assess the defense knowing what to get to offensively the poise ive liked that
8240306 you want to go out and have a good showing
8240307 obviously you want to leave a taste not only in the fans mouth but your teammates and coaches as well
8240308 this will be the last time i play this year
8240309 i have really enjoyed long island i enjoyed it from not just a business perspective or a professional side but from a family side were excited about going to the new facility its an incredible space but its hard to leave old friends as well
8240310 it is going to be slog to work though this but there is no easy way to do it

8240313 acting like a baby and the crying and all this he hated it
8240314 he was always like come on you have to grow up in your mind
8240315 when he plays his best i would take everything he has his power fighting spirit when he plays his worst game then i dont need anything
8240316 i have success now but he was no 1 in the world so i still have to catch up he can teach me many things in life
8240317 i see im right there with the top players and it gives me a lot of confidence to know that i can stay with her and i can be in the games
8240318 i had a set point in the first set so that gives a whole lot of confidence
8240319 so i think im just going to give it 100 percent on the tour and see where that takes me

8240349 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8240350 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8240351 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8240352 we found 38 per cent of mature men and 29 per cent of mature women were having sex more than once a week
8240353 thats a significant amount of older men and women having a lot of sex perhaps more than many of us suspected
8240354 these people are not frothy young singles out at the clubs having hot casual sex
8240355 theyre more likely to be at home with their loved one in front of the fire so in that respect its quite impressive
8240356 for a lot of these women their sex drive isnt like what they see on sex and the city or read about in romance novels so they think theres something wrong with them when its totally normal
8240357 i have used original kashmiri music in the film which has been recorded in kashmir i have used a lot of instruments like santoor rebab and tumbaknari and many kashmiri folk artists have also sung in the film i have tried improving this music without distorting the original essence and i hope that you will enjoy it
8240358 i feel that the background score composed by taufique in the film is fabulous it is very kashmiri and soothing to hear and you dont feel that an orchestra comprising 50 musicians is used to compose the music of the film tahaan it is very nice

8240363 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8240364 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports

8240392 he has only met his famous older brother twice once when he was just five and the last time in 2006 when senator obama was on a tour of east africa and visited nairobi

8240525 the closing of this most recent financing is a positive endorsement of our quality asset base and management team the caliber of private equity firms committed to this financing suggests a solid base of access to capital going forward for our company these funds provide the opportunity for osum to confidently move forward to first commercial production from our cold lake bitumen project of approximately 35 000 barrels per day and to pilot production at our much larger saleski project in the wabasca region of alberta where our significant land position holds the potential to produce in excess of 150 000 barrels per day from several projects
8240526 the saleski carbonates are thought by many to be one of the worlds next giant oil plays and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity to unlock a significant bitumen resource in alberta we expect an application will be filed for large scale commercial development at one of our saleski projects shortly after receipt of our first pilot results which are expected in early 2010 in short the financing we have received strengthens our momentum going forward and we look forward to taking advantage of multiple opportunities ahead of us

8240573 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8240574 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a byword for brilliance
8240575 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8240576 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level

8240622 weve had a lot of great experience with these cars and theyre running quite well

8240695 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8240696 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8240697 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8240698 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8240699 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america

8240710 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8240711 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8240712 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8240715 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8240716 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

8240724 the hijackers dont have any clear demands except for fuel and then heading to france
8240725 i dont know about their being the worst but i normally stay away from the french when i travel my brother whos a parisian travel agent says avoid the french when traveling because they tend to be negative their inability to maintain open minds make it difficult for them to adapt or accept other cultures they tend to complain and compare everything to france and close their eyes they can take the pleasure away from your travels
8240726 i dont know if the french are the least desirable tourists i do know they tend to complain about the minute details rather than calling attention to something that may not be to their liking as a result the staff may be more accommodating but there is no good or bad tourist we only have guests who expect value for the money theyre spending as professionals we hope guests will respect our staff and our local culture and the french dont tend to be the best when it comes to that whether theyre in france or traveling elsewhere
8240727 i suppose it depends on what your criteria are i live in a tourist town and the french who come here seem polite in town and excited on the ski slopes i dont hear complaints about the french the stereotypes i do hear russians are rude and entitled and too rich for their own good germans are too loud in voice and dress australians are friendly but dont tip and texans are all of the above
8240728 were all hosts in our own countries if hospitality is welcoming and thoughtful the recipient of that hospitality is going to be grateful and personable whether hes french or american thats a universal truth tourists are travelers hungry for food shelter and recognition theyre in a foreign land its not too much to ask hosts to behave graciously particularly if theyre in the hospitality industry if theyre not in that industry then good manners and human kindness should fill the gaps everything else is just trimmings

8240780 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8240781 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8240782 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8240783 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8240784 we regret this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8240785 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8240786 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8240787 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8240788 some ukrainian politicians are working hard to trigger a crisis in our relations they sort of tease us hoping that we will respond toughly which they think will raise the wave of healthy nationalism this is a cynical and dangerous game
8240789 we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base
8240790 our policy has not changed we aim to enter the pan european system of security because we are convinced that today there is no other alternative way of protecting ukraines territorial integrity her sovereignty
8240791 the skirts that the cheerleaders wear are very short and theyre very tight and theyre slit so they can do the gymnastics that are required of a cheerleader
8240792 you want to have students wear appropriate clothing during the educational period of the day and then after school wear the appropriate clothing for the event
8240793 but given the amount of people who have tried to sneak in or get photos its obviously necessary
8240794 we are handling well the challenges facing us with the competitive global environment in the food industry this year
8240795 we continue to grow and expand our international activity while improving the operating results of the group and conducting important structural changes that will facilitate further accelerated and profitable growth in the coming years

8240800 education for the past 500 years has never been considered a business if you really ask what has been one of our greatest contributions besides intellectual property besides innovative transformational models it is making people realise that there is value in education
8240801 it has been a phenomenal business model where a lot of large it education companies have faltered i think shantanu has shown what a little bit of a dream can do and he has just changed the equations completely in the education space we need hundred more shantanus who make this india education story come through and i think the wealth creation that he has done is not just from a market perspective but i think the social and national ramifications of it are far intense
8240802 today indias enrolment in the age group of 18 24 is only 11 in universities all emerging markets have 25 and developed markets maybe 50 52 so if india has to dry up the enrolment rate from 11 to 25 technology becomes a need on which education services have to be built
8240803 there are a lot of positives for educomp people who are interested in an entry into a sunrise industry could definitely look at educomp as a growth stock if there are some concerns it is that the valuation has gone very high and secondly it sees huge operator activity it has high intra day and intra month volatility so one has to be mindful of volatility
8240804 i am going ipo please help me please subscribe tell your friends and family
8240805 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8240806 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8240807 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8240808 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8240809 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8240810 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8240811 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8240812 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8240813 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8240814 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8240815 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8240816 passengers travelling with young children should attend to their own mask first
8240817 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8240818 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8240819 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later
8240820 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8240821 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8240822 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8240823 there is no guarantee that the same situation in which the north was forced to conduct the nuclear test would not be created
8240824 you have in the two people running for president interestingly two people who represent very different views of how to solve the challenges we face
8240825 on one side with barack obama you have an individual who i believe is a very charming and charismatic celebrity and senator a nominee for the democratic position to become president
8240826 as you stand back and look at joe biden you see someone who has spent 30 years dealing with foreign policy but has usually been wrong
8240827 despite the fact that we differed on issues in every debate i pointed out my respect for him
8240828 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8240829 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate

8240838 i think that his position in dealing with the issues that are important to israel like they are important to me in america is the best and kindest thing you can say is ambiguity
8240839 of grave concern it either comes from deeply held views that he has or lack of experience one or the other but in either case hes too close to the presidency not to have formed views about this that dont require having to explain it two or three different times
8240840 thats a good question and it should be a simple one but right now i feel like theres so many aspects of our great nation which could use a little bit of help or a lotta bit of help that its hard to pick just one i think the
8240841 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education

8240845 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
8240846 theres a media spin on it that were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long thats kind of the perception but i dont know anyone like that im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost

8240877 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8240878 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8240879 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region

8240885 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8240886 in the days and weeks ahead we will work with the international community to prevent this decision from having any effect on the sovereignty of my country and from further undermining the international order

8241080 this is the final culmination the nail in the coffin
8241081 georgia didnt have control of these territories and now its even more unlikely that it will ever be able to reintegrate them if georgia tried it would probably escalate into military conflict again
8241082 the western choice is an historic and natural choice of the georgian people nothing can change this choice
8241083 georgia has been trying for a very long time to tell the world what has been going on they kept saying the russians were taking up new positions and putting new elements into play but people said they were exaggerating

8241104 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8241105 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8241106 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing
8241107 hes still young but he has over 160 games under his belt so he has experience hes learning his trade
8241108 hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8241109 there has been a lot of speculation over the transfer but the bottom line is that we have a lot of defenders at the club and the circumstances around the deal mean it was the right decision
8241110 as i have said previously i am confident we have a strong enough squad and this will especially encourage james tomkins to show me what he is capable of doing
8241111 i am also looking to bring in one or two players to go with jan lastuvka and valon behrami who we have signed this summer

8241137 the truth as i came to see it is that once you fall in love really in love with that first book youll never be able to stop there will still be plenty of time to introduce the classics
8241138 typically people dont easily budge from their opinions of what an author is saying usually because they havent read the book and never will
8241139 discovered that there was no rating on books anybody could read anything

8241152 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8241153 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8241154 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8241155 i dont know whether he was trying to act out a scene in a video game or what he was trying to do but he said it always worked for him in video games

8241157 die sportliche entwicklung der letzten wochen und monate mit zuletzt drei nicht gewonnenen spielen der heimniederlage gegen rw erfurt und dem abrutschen auf den 14 tabellenplatz hat in uns die berzeugung reifen lassen chef coach edgar schmitt und seinen co trainer rainer kraft von ihren aufgaben freizustellen
8241158 wir haben mit edgar schmitt und rainer kraft gesprochen ihnen unsere sicht der dinge mitgeteilt und werden in den n chsten tagen gemeinsam die notwendigen gespr che f hren um eine f r beide seiten akzeptable trennung zu vereinbaren
8241159 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8241160 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8241161 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8241162 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8241163 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8241164 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8241165 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8241166 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8241167 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8241168 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8241169 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8241170 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8241171 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8241172 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8241173 to discuss reinstatement of the former employee at this time
8241174 one worker has been fighting for many years in support of thousands of workers at the factory so now we are fighting for that one worker
8241175 those do not stand are not criminals thinking differently is not a crime
8241176 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8241177 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8241178 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8241179 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8241180 we are delighted to have reached an agreement with hearts and very pleased that a player of calum elliots quality is coming to the club
8241181 i am certain that he will prove a valuable addition to our pool of players
8241182 its not been much fun over the past few weeks i got over the stomach problem but then the achilles flared up
8241183 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8241184 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8241185 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week
8241186 most of us would have liked to see him poulter qualifying
8241187 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there
8241188 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8241189 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8241190 the aim was to qualify for the champions league and we did that i am absolutely delighted
8241191 of course a defeat hurts but in todays case there are no complaints generally speaking we played a good game
8241192 the team is in the champions league we have beaten a good team i have seen so many games like this that turn out to be complicated
8241193 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

8241196 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8241197 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8241198 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8241199 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8241200 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8241201 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8241202 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8241203 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8241204 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8241205 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8241206 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8241207 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8241208 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8241209 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8241210 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8241250 sen biden has a strong record of opposing judicial nominees with hostile anti choice records
8241251 he voted against george w bushs two anti choice nominees to the u s supreme court john roberts and samuel alito and he opposed anti choice justice clarence thomas nomination to the court as well as multiple anti choice nominees to lower federal courts
8241252 basically joe bidens role on the senate judiciary committee has been as a front man for the far left despite all the talk about his centrism
8241253 spent three decades trying to transform the federal judiciary into a kind of activist oligarchy
8241254 joe biden has had his finger in every tawdry hearing in the senate judiciary committee in my memory
8241255 he has lowered the standard of debate he has politicized the confirmation process he has used his position to defame a number of nominees including bob bork and clarence thomas and theres no road too low that he wont travel
8241256 you can trace back the origins of our current confirmation spectacles to the days when joe biden chaired the judiciary committee for the robert bork and the clarence thomas hearings in 87 and 91
8241257 those particular hearings set the stage for the confirmation wars of today what ironically sen biden now calls a kabuki dance as if he had no hand in creating it
8241258 you have managed to convince conservative kansas republican sen brownback that youre on his side and you have managed to convince liberal massachusetts democratic sen kennedy youre on his side
8241259 were rolling the dice with you judge because you wont share your views with us youve told me nothing in this kabuki dance the public has a right to know what you think
8241260 judge you not only have a right to choose what you will answer and not answer but in my view you should not answer a question of what your view will be on an issue that clearly is going to come before the court in 50 different forms
8241261 judge bork was at the time and is still a distinguished constitutional scholar and government official who held many important posts in the executive branch and in the judiciary and sen biden basically organized a partisan smear campaign against judge bork
8241262 liberal special interest groups worked hand in hand with the liberal members of the judiciary committee to sink bork and biden was in charge of it all
8241263 its important to remember that sen biden was the chairman of the committee during the bork nomination and the thomas confirmation fights
8241264 he very much planned the hearings organized them orchestrated them and caused them to take the form that they did i think it is fair to say that he was the grand inquisitor in the inquisition he was the person really orchestrating the whole show
8241265 there was a lot of time before the hearings to allow outside left wing groups to gin up a political campaign against judge bork in general he treated the bork hearings more as if they were about electing a supreme court justice than about deciding to advise and consent about a presidential nomination
8241266 we went from having a process where the senate gave its advice and consent to nominations to one where the hearings became kind of a mini national election and depending on the full results after the hearing the senate would either ratify the nominee or nor
8241267 the thomas hearings were if anything even worse because they descended into the personal and became really almost a circus because of sen bidens inability to control the hearings
8241268 would be considered on the basis of his qualifications alone
8241269 i think that the only reason clarence thomas is on the court is because he is black i dont believe he could have won had he been white
8241270 hes been a pretty adamant filibusterer and has been very much a party to the filibustering of judicial nominees
8241271 i think that filibustering and failing to give people an up or down vote has been very much a continuation of what started with the bork hearings and the thomas hearings
8241272 these were nominees who were perfectly qualified but for the fact that they were being ideologically attacked fit the standard biden articulated in the 80s which was that he would never vote against someone for ideological reasons alone and he violated that standard when he voted against priscilla owen
8241273 the one thing he has run of importance are those two hearings and he ran them very badly and the judicial confirmation process hasnt been the same since

8241286 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8241287 its a tough moment she clearly felt she was the right person for the job and she didnt get it
8241288 so she has to come out there and do everything she can to persuade her people that theyve got to come together and that a divided party is a defeated party
8241289 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8241290 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8241291 i think the democrats understand just how tough this is going to be
8241292 clearly the american people are now looking back and saying what else is there i think its going to be a tough challenge for sen obama and hes got to do it over the next couple of days the democrats have really got to put more meat on the bone and let people know why they should win and sen mccain should lose
8241293 if you listen to all the speeches up to sen clintons speech they were full of talk about the need to stop jobs from being taken overseas

8241316 i wore a dress the other day that i made when i was 15 or 16 it was hand done because i had never learned how to operate an electric sewing machine maybe thats the reason i like wearing hand made clothes because i really appreciate the work that goes into them
8241317 they made a really personal and slightly untidy and vagrant attitude in me really beautiful in the clothes they created and thats really a dream

8241319 the motion academy of doo da what was it called the prize is probably the most famous in the world for months at least people can tell you who won the oscars but nobody really knows who wins the pulitzer prize or the nobel peace prize its shameful but true a lot of people really want one really really want one and im embarrassed because i never did and i feel a little ashamed that i was given one when i didnt really want one
8241320 the only person i ever met who called me swilda who gave me that name is matt dillon i dont know maybe he was drunk
8241321 we dont read that stuff and we dont know anybody who does everybody who knows us is so relaxed about everything and as far as i can make out the scandalous idea about us is that were really happy thats the shock if the people we live amongst do read it they very sweetly lay it to one side when theyre around us it really doesnt affect us its fairy stories of the worst kind

8241355 klimaschutz ist eine weltweite herausforderung und dabei m ssen alle staaten allen voran die industriestaaten eng zusammenarbeiten wir m ssen den ausbau und die nutzung erneuerbarer energietr ger sowie energiesparen und den effizienten einsatz von energie massiv forcieren und der weiterentwicklung von umwelttechnologien mit aller kraft vorschub leisten gleichzeitig gilt es die enormen regionalen wirtschaftlichen chancen im klimaschutz zu nutzen nur so k nnen wir eine nachhaltige energiezukunft sichern die menschen und unsere unternehmen mit energie versorgen die sie sich leisten k nnen das geld in den regionen halten und arbeitspl tze sichern
8241356 kologische und konomische chancen f r sterreich und das burgenland nutzen
8241357 ein anteil von 34 prozent an erneuerbarer energie am gesamtenergieverbrauch ist ein realistisches und machbares ziel wir m ssen jedoch unser energiesystem grundlegend ndern das bedeutet weg von fossiler energie und hin zu einer nachhaltigen nutzung erneuerbarer energietr ger gekoppelt mit massiven einsparungen im energiebereich jedoch ohne qualit tsverluste nur so k nnen wir aus der energiekostenfalle kommen und energie wieder leistbar machen innovativen umweltschonenden technologien kommt dabei genauso gro e bedeutung zu wie ver nderungen beim pers nlichen energieverbrauch etwa durch spritsparen oder die vermeidung unn tigen stromverbrauchs sowie griffigen energiekonzepten f r regionen st dte und gemeinden
8241358 beim klimaschutz haben wir eigene programme f r gemeinden wie das e5 programm im rahmen der klimaschutzinitiative klima aktiv
8241359 je mehr gemeinden ihre regionalen ressourcen und st rken nutzen und den weg in richtung energieautarkie einschlagen und damit unabh ngig von fossiler energie werden umso billiger werden die menschen ihre energie beziehen k nnen und damit gleichzeitig ihre lebensqualit t in strukturschwachen regionen deutlich verbessern

8241390 wir danken f r das in uns gesetzte vertrauen der patientinnen unsere t r ist auch in zukunft offen egal ob es sich um anliegen rund um die behandlung einer k rperlichen oder einer psychischen erkrankung etwa auch im otto wagner spital handelt oder um ein problem mit der pflege und betreuung
8241391 alg n d a en cualquier sitio indefectiblemente te encontraras a ti mismo y esta solo esta puede ser la m s feliz o la m s amarga de tus horas
8241392 in sterreich gilt berm iger alkoholgenuss unter erwachsenen leider oft immer noch als kavaliersdelikt man braucht sich also nicht dar ber wundern wenn junge menschen ihren eltern nacheifern und entsprechend fr h zu alkohol greifen
8241393 aber es ist nat rlich h chst problematisch wenn es in den schulbuffets haupts chlich cola und andere zuckerh ltige getr nke zu kaufen gibt schult ten mit schokolade gestopft werden und sportverb nde werbevertr ge mit fast food ketten abschlie en diese missst nde k nnen aber nicht den jugendlichen zur last gelegt werden
8241394 wenn man sich diesem thema also ernsthaft widmen will dann nur auf der ebene der sozialpolitik
8241395 gesunde lebensmittel sind f r viele familien mit niedrigem einkommen ber weite strecken einfach nicht mehr leistbar
8241396 acho que a ferrari ficou satisfeita quando o sol apareceu no domingo quando a temperatura da pista aumenta de verdade o carro deles realmente lhes favorece
8241397 estamos entrando agora em um territ rio interessante onde n o teremos completa certeza a respeito de qual ser o tipo de temperatura encontraremos
8241398 prov vel que monza esteja quente e cingapura mais fresca mas as corridas em spa fuji xangai e brasil podem muito bem ser abafadas como tamb m torrencialmente chuvosas
8241399 es ist erfreulich dass nun auch die gr nen best tigen dass in wien eine hohe lebensqualit t besteht diese ist zu einem wesentlichen teil auf die politik der seit jahrzehnten die politische verantwortung tragenden wiener sozialdemokratinnen zur ckzuf hren auch beim ffentlichen verkehr hat wien sowohl in sterreich als auch in der eu eine vorbildfunktion das unterstreicht auch der aktuelle modal split diesem zufolge legen die wienerinnen mit den ffis bereits mehr wege als mit dem auto zur ck in wien ist nachweislich der ffentliche verkehr eine attraktive alternative zum kfz individualverkehr
8241400 einmal mehr hat kollege maresch damit unterstrichen dass die gr nen ein sehr selektives wie gleichsam einzementiertes wahrnehmungsverm gen haben
8241401 wien forciert nachweislich den ffentlichen verkehr was sich nicht zuletzt auch in den st ndig steigenden fahrgastzahlen niederschl gt
8241402 da muss sich kollege maresch schon an nieder sterreich sowie bez glich des s bahnverkehrs an die bb wenden
8241403 das l st die probleme der branche nicht sondern schafft nur neue
8241404 berstunden ohne ende mangelnde aufstiegschancen und eine entlohnung die ein drittel unter dem sterreichweiten durchschnittseinkommen liegen f hren zur unattraktivit t der branche hier gilt es anzusetzen
8241405 schon jetzt gibt es im tourismus einen sehr hohen anteil an ausl ndischen besch ftigten st ndig nach neuen willigen und billigen arbeitskr ften zu schreien bringt den sterreichischen tourismus nicht weiter
8241406 daf r braucht es eine anhebung der l hne mehr aus und weiterbildungsm glichkeiten f r die besch ftigten sowie eine bessere vereinbarkeit von beruf und familie
8241407 wer die rechte der arbeitnehmerinnen am laufenden band missachtet und nichts f r die arbeitszufriedenheit der besch ftigten unternimmt darf sich nicht wundern wenn er immer wieder ohne personal da steht
8241408 mit der sehr gut durchgef hrten euro sowie dem neuen anti doping gesetz samt umsetzung der nationalen anti doping agentur nada austria und der gr ten bewegungsinitiative f r die kinder und jugendliche in der 2 republik ab dem schuljahr 2008 09 wurden wichtige schritte f r den sterreichischen sport gesetzt
8241409 drei olympia medaillen sind f r sterreich genau durchschnitt wir haben mit 30 top ten platzierungen in peking allerdings besser als in athen abgeschnitten ziel muss es aber sein mit 20 sportarten in london breiter als in peking vertreten zu sein
8241410 warum sollte sterreich zum beispiel in badminton ringen rudern oder taekwondo in london nicht dabei sein
8241411 hier hat die bildungsministerin schmied verabs umt gegen zu steuern
8241412 es gilt und dabei gebe es bereinstimmung mit bundeskanzler gusenbauer
8241413 ich hoffe das ist ein ansporn f r die l nder selbst aktiv zu werden
8241414 was die bundesregierung in den letzten jahren f r den sport geleistet habe ist keine verlorene arbeit gewesen es sind projekte eingeleitet worden auf denen gut aufgebaut werden kann ich hoffe dass der sport auch in der n chsten bundesregierung entsprechenden stellenwert genie en wird
8241415 w hrend die europ ische integration und ihre auswirkungen nicht selten dazu genutzt werden ngste und vorurteile zu sch ren und damit politisches kleingeld zu wechseln versucht die gpa djp sehr konkrete probleme im sinne der arbeitnehmerinnen zu l sen
8241416 wir bekennen uns zur schaffung eines offenen und dynamischen arbeitsmarktes in europa der allerdings auf den grunds tzen von fairness und gerechtigkeit beruhen muss ein europa das auf dumping von arbeits und sozialrechtlichen standards fu t wird auf dauer nicht das vertrauen der b rgerinnen und b rger erhalten durch das heute gestartete projekt wollen wir wertvolle beitr ge zur schaffung eines europas liefern das die interessen der arbeitnehmerinnen in den mittelpunkt stellt
8241417 quando estamos em uma posi o poss vel de faz lo precisamos pontuar com os dois carros
8241418 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8241419 and i said to myself something is going on here
8241420 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
8241421 we hope that our investigations can shed some light on the sinking
8241422 sometimes you can put it all together and come up with some good theory but its like anything in archaeology youll never be 100 certain
8241423 this year we just want it to be a little more of a broader appeal
8241424 i think shes a little more daring in ways but for a better reason just a more fun outlook as opposed to some personal vendetta against people
8241425 well we didnt know that we were going to not finish but the strike kind of changed all of that so luckily what works in our favor this year which would not have worked last year at all is that each episode is self contained even though there may be a character that goes over a few episodes you can watch each one and feel like youve wrapped up a story so luckily episode seven which is the one that we finished on if you didnt know it wasnt no ones getting stabbed but its still an exciting episode i mean do we have bigger plans sure but does it work yes
8241426 these two have kissed before on fiends i think it was how they got their apartment back
8241427 youre out of words sobbing deep into the night this is like a play
8241428 our only problem is getting our dog to crap on cement
8241429 it took forever to get cosby show washer and dryers out of our offices
8241430 i think i just got very drunk that night daniel read then we went to bed it wasnt going to be my ending or what i had in mind
8241431 weve talked about doing a song and a dance wrapping it up
8241432 lorelais in the shower and she says to rory youre adopted
8241433 we know were back but were not entirely sure how
8241434 hell do it in a very house way were doing to do a house version of survivor
8241435 i was in bed the phone rings and you get a piece of news
8241436 theyre three of the best scripts ever i find them absolutely phenomenal it mixes broad comedy tragedy literary references it jumps from tone to tone
8241437 we have deals with five new actors that could turn into series deals
8241438 house is going to give them all numbers so he doesnt have to learn their names
8241439 i have a little man who does it for me
8241440 i think people are entertained by house hes worth putting up with he saves lives thats a pretty endearing quality if youre staring death in the face its actually a very endearing quality
8241441 each year we are faced with the challenge of having to design a new collection of looney tunes shorts that outshines the last
8241442 our objective for the sixth volume was to create an attention grabbing volume that is a combination of some of the rarest most original and best loved cartoons that even the savviest of animation connoisseurs would want to own looney tunes are an important part of american cinematic history and these wonderful collections give us the opportunity to appreciate the beauty wonder and artistry behind the art of animation looney tunes golden collection volume six is the type of dvd collection that collectors will want to add to their home entertainment libraries
8241443 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
8241444 its not just deeply offensive to me and my team although it is but it also risks undermining confidence amongst the victims of child abuse that justice will be done
8241445 if the evidence is there the prosecutions will be brought and pursued with a great deal of vigour but i find the allegation of obstructing justice very unhelpful
8241446 no honey i love the pudding you can have the applesauce
8241447 so now we have a nicer more understanding lucy spiller and believe it or not it works
8241448 were really happy with the performance of dirt and the riches and i expect them to return
8241449 network television is dying and the networks have no one to blame but themselves
8241450 i dont know if the prices are going to keep going down but i dont think theyre going to start going up not for another six months or more
8241451 thats certainly the largest decline weve seen in the current downturn
8241452 if its a solid market people dont duck out of deals
8241453 the abrupt turn in the credit cycle is now hurting many more institutions
8241454 the positive of the negative was that we didnt have an influx of population and that meant we didnt have the overbuilding this time around
8241455 were seeing a modest increase in nonperforming assets and delinquent loans supporting the theory of a soft landing not a crash landing
8241456 the northeast and mid atlantic states arent seeing as many banks struggling
8241457 i admit i questioned the wisdom of giving the games to a city with such a poor human rights record every citizen under surveillance police executing suspects people interrogated just for taking a photo in a railway station but maybe london can rise to the occasion
8241458 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8241459 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8241460 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8241461 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8241462 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8241463 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8241464 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8241465 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8241466 now your brain isnt that big but its devoted on your right side to something where youre saying thats a low value item for me
8241467 well theyve got concerts vendors tours of the new museum factory tours lots of acts finishing up with bruce springsteen on saturday night
8241468 it turned out to be bigger and better than we thought it was the 1st year doing it last year and as an athletic department we won an ncaa award for it for being the top community engagement activity
8241469 alright now heres the flip side to all this as much as i enjoy the crazy don storyline i ask again what does it have to do with anything its like watching two different shows weve got the whole gossip side and weve got don it just confuses me sometimes
8241470 it was also more fun for the kids that way they get to know us a little better and get to know police officers arent so scary and they can come up to us when they need anything
8241471 i am not capable of rationally accepting that there is a ball in b
8241472 i have good reason to doubt or deny that there is a ball in b
8241473 but aside from that i think you have to be funny so that other people dont freak out i mean its fine to be going oh my god i have cancer with your closest friends but you cant do that with everyone you cant ask the entire world to buoy you up
8241474 with cancer its saying you can take my body but youre not taking my mind
8241475 theres a form of macho defiance there i really like
8241476 there are two issues hitting the market the financial situation cited by the fdic and hurricane gustav
8241477 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8241478 we expect that banks and thrifts will keep building up reserves for the next several quarters
8241479 the tax will fall most heavily on the weakest so the conclusion is the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak

8241491 ma astept ca in cazurile seres si pacuraru sa se dea nup pana la sfarsitul lui septembrie
8241492 colegii sunt de parare ca e bine sa evitam etapa grupului intermediar si considera ca acest lucru nu va intarzia dezbaterea in consecinta fiecare membru al comisiei va studia dosarul si il vom lua in dezbatere peste doua saptamani pe 8 septembrie
8241493 am stabilit procedura de lucru in dosarul care il vizeaza pe serban mihailescu si am adoptat aceeasi procedura pe care am utilizat o in cazul celorlalti doi senatori marti vom incepe sa citim cele 6 volume care ne au fost inaintate de parchetul general

8241498 the soul when upset by resentments and anger is unable to see things in their true light to form unbiased judgments to make wise decisions or to keep words and actions within the limits of courtesy and kindness
8241499 and take care that our heart does not escape from our hands therefore let us place it every morning in an attitude of humility meekness and tranquility perfect equanimity meekness and unalterable graciousness are virtues more rare than perfect chastity and are most desirable
8241500 o jesus meekest lamb who being cursed did not curse who suffering great injuries did not threaten who receiving the greatest contempt answered with divine meekness or preserved an admirable silence help me to follow your example to repress my anger to embrace my meekness and armed with patience to suffer willingly any labor so that i may come to enjoy eternal repose with you
8241501 a colleague calls you from vancouver and says she is looking for legal help with a xxx problem how would you go about finding the right person to refer her to
8241502 but access to people can be phenomenal and that takes more than users relying on search technology alone

8241504 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8241505 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8241506 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8241507 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8241508 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8241509 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8241510 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8241511 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8241512 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8241513 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8241514 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity

8241516 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8241517 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally

8241519 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8241520 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8241521 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8241522 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8241523 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8241524 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8241525 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8241526 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8241527 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8241528 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8241529 who are open to doing something on the production side
8241530 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8241531 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8241532 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8241533 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8241534 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8241535 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8241536 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8241537 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8241538 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8241539 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8241540 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8241541 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8241542 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8241543 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8241544 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8241545 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8241546 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8241547 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8241548 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8241549 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8241550 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8241551 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8241552 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8241553 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8241554 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8241555 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8241556 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8241557 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8241558 help churches find ways to help christians get to the polls
8241559 our vision statement is an american society that affirms and practices judeo christian values rooted in biblical authority
8241560 america will be better off if people who are voting are seeking gods guidance
8241561 yes the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8241562 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past

8241621 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8241622 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8241623 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8241624 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8241625 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8241626 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8241627 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8241628 its a tough moment she clearly felt she was the right person for the job and she didnt get it
8241629 so she has to come out there and do everything she can to persuade her people that theyve got to come together and that a divided party is a defeated party
8241630 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8241631 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8241632 i think the democrats understand just how tough this is going to be
8241633 clearly the american people are now looking back and saying what else is there i think its going to be a tough challenge for sen obama and hes got to do it over the next couple of days the democrats have really got to put more meat on the bone and let people know why they should win and sen mccain should lose

8241656 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum
8241657 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8241658 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting

8241894 but since every company is so unique they are more anecdotal than instructional
8241895 a clear concise style providing bulleted lists for key points as well as examples and analogies

8241897 patricia is a highly experienced and accomplished industry professional her knowledge of imax r theatre exhibition and track record as the head of distribution for national geographics imax r films not to mention her long standing relationships with many of the industrys key players make her a great asset to our company

8241901 everyone is either blue collar white collar redneck or country and so are their pets
8241902 so we decided to create cute comfortable 100 cotton novelty collars people could share with their beloved pets to make a statement about who they are
8241903 our company name why didnt i think of that defines the reaction people have to our cutting edge pet products
8241904 weve replaced the age old pet bandana with a brand new novelty collar that can also be a unique marketing strategy to advertise company names logos products services or events these collars are quite literally walking billboards for the 98 million cats and 76 million dogs in the u s and millions of pets pet owners worldwide limited only by imagination

8241912 increasing the use of recycled content will deliver carbon dioxide co2 savings through greater substitution of virgin polymer in the manufacture of new bottles as well as conserve valuable resources and divert waste from landfill
8241913 the roadmap contains targets for closed loop recycling of plastic milk bottles as well as dairies sending near zero waste to landfill
8241914 other projects include lightweighting bottles to reduce the amount of plastic used in making each one and offering consumers the option of fresh milk in bags which generates far less waste than a bottle

8241923 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8241924 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8241925 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8241926 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8241927 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8241928 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8241929 democrats know how to do this as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats and if we do our part well do it again with president obama and the democrats
8241930 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8241931 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8241932 this race is all about the future and thats why we must elect barack obama
8241933 in four months we will have an administration that actually believes in science
8241934 its an emotional time for all delegates but in the end when we leave this convention we will have a country that needs to get back on track
8241935 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
8241936 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like mine did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had themselves
8241937 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do and that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8241938 michelle had one job ahead of her she had to portray her husband barack obama as a hard working ordinary american citizen that americans could believe in
8241939 she hit a home run she really kept it real had personal stories to share stories about bringing their daughter home from the hospital stories about him talking to the community it was her job to focus on him and she did a good job
8241940 shes smart well educated articulate poised and i think she can go anywhere on behalf of americans and i also think shell be a solid base to enable her husband to withstand the pressures of that job
8241941 i think americans will be very luck to have her in the white house if they elect barack obama as president i think shes a clear winner as part of that team
8241942 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing was going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
8241943 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8241944 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and high endeavor
8241945 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try
8241946 today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon

8241953 americans across the country are struggling to stretch every dollar just to put gas in their car or food on the table and the bottom line is carrying around extra weight directly effects their bottom lines

8241975 currently the glory in the global fight against climate change is reserved for those progressive governments which are getting the debate further down to the essentials
8241976 the cumbersome talks in accra did not stop a first group of determined negotiators from working towards a critical shift in the debate but a success at the next climate talks in poznan is far from secured and we need to see more countries engage seriously in lifting the political ambitions
8241977 smoke grenades thrown by backward parties and an overdose of procedural discussions have paralyzed the climate talks and overwhelmed negotiators for too long

8241991 in addition to direct sales to enterprises going forward it hopes that extending out from private clouds to public ones what we like to call cloudbursting will become a prevailing it weather pattern and provide it with additional opportunities
8241992 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8241993 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8241994 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8241995 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2

8242068 lasting piece of art in recognition of the unique place and impact the cooling towers have had in sheffield
8242069 certainly religion cannot be invoked for crimes of this type
8242070 expresses its solidarity with local churches and the religious orders involved and condemns these actions which are an affront to dignity peoples freedom and endanger peaceful civil coexistence
8242071 the current number and distribution of security forces in orissa is nothing like enough to deal with the problem
8242072 we appeal to the international community to raise their voices to bring peace in an area where more people will die unless something is done urgently
8242073 while i firmly condemn every attack on human life whose sacredness required respect by all i express my spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in the faith who are so sorely tried
8242074 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8242075 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8242076 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8242077 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8242078 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8242079 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8242080 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8242081 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8242082 if i dont watch movie on first day first show its a shame on me as fan
8242083 the victim was playing with a revolver spinning the cylinder placing it to his neck and then pulling the trigger

8242095 our results this quarter were affected by the volatile and generally difficult environment that persisted over much of the third quarter as well as by the impact of our ongoing run off activities and the refocusing of our core businesses particularly in cibc world markets
8242096 during the quarter we continued to actively manage our exposures
8242097 there was almost a comfort in knowing that i was getting to work with somebody who had been on the original with me and gone through the same experiences
8242098 like okay weve been through the war together already i never even gave any thought to it being awkward i know how much ive grown up since then i would assume that shes grown up the same amount

8242104 im here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat as a proud senator for new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8242105 fate of our nation and the future of our children
8242106 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team
8242107 and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8242108 she was unbelievable i thought it was really magnificent i was proud of her
8242109 which candidate offers the change we need to restore the promise of america
8242110 is it john mccain he continues to claim that under president bush we made great progress economically in 2007 he voted with the bush administration 95 percent of the time so if hes the answer the question must be ridiculous
8242111 only one candidate in the race offers the change we need to restore the promise of america a person of integrity honesty and love for his country barack obama
8242112 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8242113 now let me tell you if you think youve seen dramatic changes in the world and in technology in the last ten years you aint seen nothing yet
8242114 we cannot afford more of the same leave it to the republicans to serve a big business agenda and call it a small business plan they may not know the difference between wall street and main street but barack obama knows that small business is big business in america
8242115 i thought joe biden as a selection for barack obama was designed of course to bring foreign policy experience to barack obamas team and his ticket
8242116 i think it brings experience but if you look at joe bidens record with some 30 years in foreign policy experience theres about 30 years of being generally being wrong on foreign policy issues
8242117 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8242118 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8242119 we have collected the fine music and songs which under the papacy were used to carry false teaching but we have adapted other texts to the music so that they may adorn true doctrine instead the melodies and notes are precious it would be a pity to let them perish we have put this music on the living and holy word of god in order to sing praise and honor it we are concerned with changing the text not the music
8242120 i saw this beautiful sunrise yestersol bittersweet as it means an end to midnight sun in the martian arctic
8242121 but im used to only speaking to my swimmers im not a huge ohio state fan i watch them and root for them but im pretty focused on my own team so before i agreed i thought jim should hear my philosophies first
8242122 it turns out we share a lot of the same philosophies
8242123 we found ourselves nodding our heads over issues and how to go about putting together championship teams
8242124 i was the biggest guy in high school at about 6 5 210 pounds as a sophomore and frank bartholow the schools swim coach wasnt too happy about me playing football
8242125 i was out there with the team for about two weeks when this guy went right through me
8242126 you would think we focus on winning with all that weve won so one would presume that a loss here at kenyon would undo us
8242127 weve lost a couple of womens titles but that just gave us a different challenge
8242128 you wont see lords going for no 30 up in the mens locker room were not obsessed with winning were concerned with what does it means to be successful obviously its important to get the answer right to that question
8242129 diehard ohio state fans would say the answer is winning the bcs title game but if all you focus on is the end result the means arent going to work your way you define what it means to be successful and what you do during the season should embody what that means then you let the chips fall where they may
8242130 i heard the commentators say that phelps is underappreciated because he did something that it impossible to do which is win when youre expected to win

8242132 hopefully people will learn to respect each other and live in communal harmony across the religious divide i pray that the government is able to bring peace to the region
8242133 i am deeply saddened by the news of the recent happenings in orissa a place which will forever be close to my heart
8242134 i was in orissa during may this year it was like a homecoming i spent 10 days wish it was longer enveloped in the warmth of the people who still affectionately address me as didi
8242135 we need to learn to love and respect one another even if some are different to what we are
8242136 certainly god has helped me to forgive he has created each one of us and he doesnt want us to be killing each other unless we give up the bitterness and prejudices the cycle of violence will never end
8242137 the government will take all necessary steps to safeguard the fundamental rights and liberties of all sections of our society and protect their religious freedom we will not tolerate any efforts aimed at disturbing the communal harmony or secular fabric of our country
8242138 responsible reporting of unadulterated truth can go a long way in calming sectarian tensions but at the same time sensationalising facts can flare up a situation
8242139 we have given orders to shoot at sight anybody defying curfew and indulging in violence

8242166 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8242167 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8242168 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8242169 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8242170 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
8242171 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8242174 how it got down is beyond me there was a fair bit of skill involved mr wright said
8242175 i was standing out the front of my house and the plane came under the power lines
8242176 it missed a big tree skidded in front of my house for about 50 metres and hit a couple of grass trees that ripped the wing off
8242177 hitting the grass trees stopped it and i sprinted off down the street by the time i got there the pilot and passenger had jumped out
8242178 there was a fair bit of fuel spilling out so we cleared the area
8242179 it sounded like the pilot was trying to start it again he said

8242187 the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact

8242208 we have developed petroleum products from organic municipal wastes and we are looking into its commercial viability
8242209 we will have to have an economic analysis of the finding before going to commercial production

8242222 we forged the 12 point agreement with other political parties to bring down king gyanendras regime in 2006 in india
8242223 because of that and other geographic and cultural relations my visit to india would have political connotation
8242224 the rbis more aggressive approach reflects its growing concern about the sudden acceleration in inflation to nearly 12 7 percent earlier this month
8242225 the rbi is aware of the balancing act it has to do as reflected in its policy statement on july 29 which not only raised the central banks inflation target for 2008 09 to 7 percent from 5 5 5 percent but also lowered its economic growth forecast to 8 percent from 8 8 5 percent
8242226 we however expect the real gdp growth to noticeably moderate from 9 percent last year to 7 5 percent this fiscal
8242227 although the slowdown has so far been restricted to the industrial sector it will spread to the services sector as the squeeze on costs becomes more pervasive and demand slackens
8242228 we forecast two 25 basis point cuts in the rbis key policy rates in the second half of next year

8242240 i have been working with the indian team to hone their skills on the football field the side shows great promise and as the sport gains popularity in india more people will want to be involved and this will lift the standard of play
8242241 we see it as a great opportunity to introduce australian rules football to india we are hosting the indian team at our home ground in suburban essendon they will watch our senior team train and then train themselves
8242242 indians are now the number one immigrants into the state of victoria and indian overseas students are the second largest cohort of international students in the state we are encouraging students and immigrants to play afl as it will help them integrate with the community by getting involved and connected with this very australian cultural activity
8242243 presently the afl and austrade australian trade commission are partnering to deliver exhibition games in india in late january early february 2009 we are planning to have the game played between two afl clubs before a crowd of approximately 10 000 people and to be televised both in australia and in india
8242244 we will link australian and indian businesses to deliver the match and to provide profiling sponsorship opportunities for mutual benefit

8242259 the awful weather clearly has something to do with this hibernation hysteria
8242260 however with gas and electric companies turning up the heat it looks like many people will be turning to their wardrobe rather than the central heating thermostat this winter to keep warm

8242270 i think the cup run has certainly focused us and promotion has to be an objective this season
8242271 if we avoid injuries then we can do well and promotion is a target set down for the players
8242272 lots of games were cancelled because of the weather in pre season which has not been ideal but on the plus side we have managed to recruit a number of players
8242273 as a yardstick for the new season i usually use pre season training and apparently there were 40 boys up at training last thursday with the 1st and 2nd xv which is unheard of
8242274 it is great as it means everybody will be fighting for a position in the first team
8242275 we have been looking forward to it since we secured third spot last season and are looking forward to now knowing who we will be playing
8242276 we are hoping for a draw that will get us into the group stages so would prefer a draw that would gave us a chance of this as opposed to one against a massive club from spain germany or italy
8242277 there are teams in the draw that would give us a better chance
8242278 dont get me wrong we would take on anyone but we are obviously going to be up against it if we get one of the bigger clubs
8242279 i would like to think that the fact i played about 10 years consecutively for aberdeen hamburg and celtic in european competition would help us as a club
8242280 i played many european games probably over 70 so i do have plenty of experience of going and playing in europe and yes i propose to put that to good use
8242281 i was at glasgow airport on monday morning and there were queen of the south fans heading off for their match in denmark and it got me excited thinking that our fans could be trooping off to some other clime to support their team
8242282 the dream for me would be a draw that gives us a chance and then we get tottenham hamburg and ac milan in the group stages
8242283 if we play aswell as we did on saturday against dundee united then we will be unlucky not to win
8242284 as far as im concerned the second half performance on saturday was as good as any performance we put in last season
8242285 we were the better team against aberdeen dominating possession and play but just never got the goal and it was the same against dundee united we did the same to hearts and kilmarnock in the first half dozen games of last year and lost so it will come
8242286 mach das nicht denn wenn du ihnen nicht gef llst wenn du du selbst bist dann m gen sie den der so sein will wie sie auch nicht
8242287 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8242288 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8242289 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club
8242290 i think its a great choice for this area because he has a background here hopefully it will bring in those supporters who havent decided who theyre going to vote for
8242291 a lot of people do know him from around the area a lot of people have met him before to have someone that important in politics its even that more important to come here
8242292 biden is a guy that even though hes from delaware he calls scranton home he comes here a lot and i think the people he appeals to are the type of people that scrantonians and northeastern pennsylvanians want to vote for
8242293 hes a very intelligent man but he really connects with people hes from this blue collar neighborhood this is an irish catholic neighborhood joe bidens been very good to the area

8242300 i will not play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8242301 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family
8242302 but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8242303 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8242304 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8242305 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8242306 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8242307 however should such an offer be received then the club would be forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave
8242308 as soon as our sneakers touched the track one of my friends went zipping off a long distance runner at heart i took a much slower steady approach i was lapped within the first few minutes like an undesirable birthday spanking the lapping didnt seem to have an end

8242326 some people came up to me a few weeks ago and told me they were following us from place to place coming to bars just to see us play
8242327 that moved mountains for me just getting compliments from people is what keeps us all going
8242328 were still young as a band but weve hit the ground running
8242329 most of our gigs we get from word of mouth
8242330 we all bring a lot of different backgrounds into the band and it reflects on our music
8242331 originally we would just play out as nick and shawn
8242332 i knew a guy and shawn knew a guy and we just came together
8242333 we dont want to be known as a cover band but we do a very good job on a lot of songs
8242334 we all have day jobs and then were out until one in the morning one or two nights week the bands like a small business in and of itself
8242335 i would hope we all have aspirations to one day have our music pay the bills
8242336 in this instance there was already mercaptan in the gas and the system added more
8242337 any tiny pinhole leak that would go for years now stinks because of all the odorant
8242338 we had a blown regulator and 20 leaks in our pipes

8242388 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8242389 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile

8242394 i was a relatively late entry into this years miss earth scotland contest
8242395 i worried i may be a little unprepared but i had an amazing night and was placed second runner up securing a place in the finals of the miss earth scotland competition
8242396 i had thought about doing miss scotland and i had been looking at different pageants online
8242397 this beauty competition stuck out as being more interesting and it has a purpose too
8242398 being a great lover of wildlife and animals i have naturally taken notice of the effects human activities have on the earth and the problems arising from this
8242399 i therefore feel it is our responsibility to counteract this by doing what we can to reduce waste reuse and recycle
8242400 the focal point of my environmental project will be to emphasise the importance of reducing waste and to encourage people to be more economical in their daily lives
8242401 i would also heavily promote the incorporation of environmental issues into the education system for all school ages
8242402 with the environment and education being matters devolved to the scottish parliament i plan to find out what the parliament has in place currently and for the future to tackle such issues and if possible i would like to get involved in projects
8242403 we worked closely with the three trade unions in a bid to secure as many exemptions as possible to ensure our vulnerable residents received a full service
8242404 on a disappointing note home care services were significantly and unacceptably disrupted as the unions refused to grant us any exemptions for their delivery despite doing so for other councils
8242405 this created considerable difficulties within the service and all efforts were concentrated on maintaining service delivery to the most vulnerable clients requiring care
8242406 not only did north lanarkshire council request a completely unreasonable level of strike exemptions it was particularly hypocritical because in recent job evaluation discussions the council refused to accept that 80 per cent of home carers delivered personal care
8242407 unison were prepared to agree a reasonable number but the council continually failed to give any realistic reasons or break down their numbers
8242408 we were committed to doing all we could to minimise disruption to services across north lanarkshire during the industrial action
8242409 we were pleased to be able to keep our schools open particularly as this was the first week back for the pupils and many were starting school for the first time
8242410 negotiations continue at a national level and we are currently working to minimise the after effects of the industrial action on our services
8242411 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8242412 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without any problems
8242413 i cant say if ive been included in the shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to chelsea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8242414 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8242415 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8242416 the united states and israel have formed a unique partnership to meet the growing strategic threats in the middle east
8242417 citizens in these countries are genuinely distressed at the plight of the palestinians and at the role they perceive the united states to be playing
8242418 poisoned relations between the west and the arab and islamic worlds
8242419 the strategic balance decidedly favors israel which has continued to widen the qualitative gap between its own military capability and deterrence powers and those of its neighbors
8242420 a racist law that determines who can live here according to racist criteria
8242421 after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine
8242422 it is impossible to imagine general evacuation of the arab population without compulsion and brutal compulsion
8242423 the idea of transfer is as old as modern zionism and has accompanied its evolution and praxis during the past century
8242424 if i were an arab leader i would never make terms with israel

8242430 it is routine for us to say this is our 14
8242431 it would be obscene at any time for the president of the world jewish congress to lobby the president of the united states to resist policies being promoted by the government of israel
8242432 there is absolutely no room in the jewish mainstream for actively canvassing against the security related policies
8242433 the word pressure is not in my vocabulary when it comes to israel
8242434 there are a lot of guys at the working level up here on capitol hill who happen to be jewish who are willing to look at certain issues in terms of their jewishness
8242435 all the jews in america from coast to coast gathered to oust percy
8242436 it is common for members of congress and their staffs to turn to aipac first when they need information before calling the library of congress the congressional research service committee staff or administration experts
8242437 often called upon to draft speeches work on legislation advise on tactics perform research collect co sponsors and marshal votes
8242438 you cant have an israeli policy other than what aipac gives you around here
8242439 when people ask me how they can help israel i tell them help aipac
8242440 depend on jewish supporters to supply as much as 60 percent of the money
8242441 anonymous attackers are clogging the e mail inboxes of jewish leaders around the country warning without much evidence that dean would somehow be bad for israel
8242442 negotiating with two israeli teams one displaying an israeli flag and one an american flag
8242443 columnists and commentators who can be counted upon to support israel reflexively and without qualification
8242444 shamir sharon bibi whatever those guys want is pretty much fine by me
8242445 i was much more deeply devoted to israel than i dared to assert
8242446 fortified by my knowledge of israel and my friendships there i myself wrote most of our middle east commentaries as more arab than jewish readers recognized i wrote them from a pro israel perspective
8242447 one can be sure that any public statement in support of the palestinian people by the preeminent literary critic edward said will elicit hundreds of e mails letters and journalistic accounts that call on us to denounce said and to either sanction or fire him
8242448 the complaints started flowing in from people who disagreed with the content of his political views
8242449 where it is as bad as it was in the 1930s
8242450 there is a clear problem of anti zionist verging on anti semitic attitudes emerging in the grass 25
8242451 the general uk economic background and its impact on the construction sector cannot be ignored however we are not exposed to the residential sector and our significant share of olympic related work illustrates our competences and value as well as our high supplier preference rating

8242454 the conduct that he obama demonstrated during this campaign he never once mentioned cesar chavez in the speeches that i heard
8242455 its going to change a few peoples minds when they really listen to him not just hear him

8242463 i had never seen a grape vineyard until i started this place
8242464 with 20 acres of grapes i pretty much had to start a winery
8242465 what else could i do with them all the mistakes we made ended up being good ones
8242466 im proud of what we do were able to see the whole cycle of production which is pretty unusual for any business
8242467 were moving from being a family business to a family run business and that is a learning experience for all of us

8242469 wine stores and grocery chains are calling us for the first time to sell our product instead of the other way around
8242470 the schuchters give a fantastic variety to customers and have the highest standards which the customers obviously pick up on
8242471 seeing someone like joe schuchter at a wine tasting and talking to him it adds to the experience and lets people know where the wine is coming from
8242472 people want a quality wine and have learned they dont have to pay an extraordinary price for it

8242474 in lebanon all the present business leaders have known each other for years
8242475 i just felt like the underlying managers the up and comers have no real knowledge that each other exists
8242476 our group is focused on lebanon and the community we want to help people learn how to move up but keep a local spin on the problems
8242477 it seems like the leaders now know how to network

8242534 we cannot overlook the importance of preparation when sending students back to school
8242535 it is crucial that parents of children at risk for severe allergic reactions provide the school with auto injectable epinephrine
8242536 being prepared in case of an emergency is critical in preventing the most serious effects since accidental exposure to known food allergens are the rule rather than the exception and anaphylaxis may progress very quickly we know that in fatal anaphylaxis respiratory or cardiac arrest will usually occur within 10 20 minutes for bee stings and within 20 45 minutes for food reactions 10 that gives very little time for an appropriate response
8242537 creating a plan to prevent exposures and respond to severe allergic reactions in our schools requires informing classmates teachers and other school staff about the students allergy and teaching them to recognize the symptoms so they can assist if an emergency arises it also means having auto injectable epinephrine handy that is easy to use and can be quickly administered in a crisis situation

8242562 the interest in local sourcing food traceability and school gardens is on the rise and these elements of the farm to school movement have overwhelming support from food service directors and front line staff across oregon
8242563 the kaiser permanente community fund recognizes the nutritional significance that school prepared meals play for thousands of oregon children and their families so we see this program as a meaningful and effective way to set kids on a lifelong path of healthy eating
8242564 we also were motivated to support this program because the foundational data that will be gathered will inform new policies supporting childrens health and nutrition in the upcoming legislative session and beyond
8242565 these two diverse school districts were chosen to study how different procurement regulations may apply and how agricultural operations will need to be scaled to meet the food demand of each district
8242566 we anticipate learning how to scale this program to fit any number of school districts across oregon in coming years
8242567 portland is the first large urban school district in the country to make such substantial gains in the farm to school programming
8242568 this process has inspired us to incorporate local ingredients in products that we use every day such as the northwest grown wheat in almost all of our baked goods
8242569 were reinventing the lunchroom one meal at a time and excited to show what a little more money spent on school food can do to form life long healthy eating habits among school aged children

8242611 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8242612 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8242613 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8242614 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part

8242618 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8242619 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8242620 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8242621 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8242622 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8242623 no one works for someone we all just work together
8242624 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8242625 prospects of our continuing presence in the pgm space looks decidedly positive
8242626 this acquisition will strengthen our position both in the western and eastern limbs of the bushveld where the pgm ore body is mostly found
8242627 this deal reinforces what we envisaged when mvelaphanda resources and afripalm resources joined forces in 2007 which is to become a pre eminent black controlled mining house and principal consolidator of key opportunities
8242628 as we promised at the time we will continue to unlock value in our operations diversify our portfolio and achieve a better balance between the existing components of diamonds gold and platinum as well as pursuing other interests in other commodities
8242629 this is a continuation of our relationship with mvelaphanda resources after nedbank capital was involved in financing afripalm resources in the acquisition of its stake in mvelaphanda resources in 2007
8242630 this deal marks a historic occasion in the bee mining space and we feel honoured to have acted as advisors to the parties involved

8242634 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8242635 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8242636 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8242637 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8242638 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8242639 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8242640 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8242641 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8242642 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8242643 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8242644 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8242645 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8242646 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8242647 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8242648 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8242649 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8242650 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8242651 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8242652 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8242653 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8242654 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8242655 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8242656 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8242657 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8242658 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8242659 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8242660 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8242661 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8242662 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8242663 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8242664 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8242665 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8242666 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8242667 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8242668 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8242669 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8242670 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8242671 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8242672 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8242673 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8242674 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8242675 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8242676 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8242677 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8242678 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8242679 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8242680 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8242681 i think all of us just heard one of the best speeches ever
8242682 hillary clinton gave us our marching orders and we have to do everything we can to elected barack obama
8242683 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8242684 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8242685 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8242686 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8242687 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8242688 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8242689 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8242690 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8242691 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8242692 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8242693 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8242694 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8242695 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8242696 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8242697 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8242698 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8242699 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8242700 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8242701 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8242702 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8242703 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8242704 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8242705 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8242706 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8242707 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8242708 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8242709 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

8242714 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8242715 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8242716 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8242720 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 40 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
8242721 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community
8242722 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
8242723 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

8242725 atrocious weather has seriously delayed the harvest this year but this is not a symptom of so called global warming
8242726 these conditions are not unique and are more like the poor august weather britain saw during the twenties and sixties it is more likely a stark reminder that the warming trend we recorded in the last part of the 20th century has now stalled
8242727 we are not suddenly about to be catapulted towards a mediterranean climate idiotic bbc 2 gardening programmes please note we are surrounded by water with the vast atlantic ocean to our west while the jet stream and gulf stream will forever influence our daily weather and long term climate

8242738 the biggest issues that we face right now are high gas prices i believe we need to drill for oil in alaska and the gulf mr grayson supports no new drilling i oppose any tax increases in a time when people are hurting so much mr grayson wouldnt make the bush tax cuts permanent i believe that people should have a second amendment right to own a gun mr grayson supports gun control so we have crystal clear differences on the issues facing the american public
8242739 we made 100 000 phone calls 100 000 knocks on the door this is a campaign that reached people and listened to people and thats what people really want these days they want a candidate who listens so thats why we won
8242740 malone ran a good race but the voters of orange county have spoken they want jerry demings to be the candidate

8242791 vier franz sische soldaten von den aufst ndischen gefangen genommen und exekutiert worden
8242792 it really wasnt specific on barack obama as much as it was an endorsement of the democratic agenda for every delegate that she riles up here she riles up a republican
8242793 i appreciated the fact that it seemed to be a very technical speech of supporting him as a democrat but during the primary she said he wasnt ready to be president she never addressed that nothing really came from the heart here obama clearly is their candidate x who they agree with on the issues but is not ready to be president
8242794 she set the table obama has to put the meat on the table everything about her with his speech on thursday night i will be impressed about i think hes got to be more conversational direct criticize the bush administration and lay out clearly what hes going to do right now i think the obamas are pretty glad the clintons are in this
8242795 you dont have to pay sales tax in your state on goods purchased in another state
8242796 after careful review and consideration we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting new york sales tax effective august 21 2008
8242797 this decision was driven by your direct and candid feedback and our continued commitment to you as our valued customers
8242798 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8242799 i have not been heavily involved in singing the praises of the nixon administration but the case for impeaching bush and cheney is far stronger than was the case against nixon and vice president spiro t agnew after the 1972 election the nation would be much more secure and productive under a nixon presidency than with bush indeed has any administration in our national history been so damaging as the bush cheney era
8242800 bush and cheney are clearly guilty of numerous impeachable offenses they have repeatedly violated the constitution they have transgressed national and international law they have lied to the american people time after time their conduct and their barbaric policies have reduced our beloved country to a historic low in the eyes of people around the world these are truly high crimes and misdemeanors to use the constitutional standard
8242801 from the beginning the bush cheney teams assumption of power was the product of questionable elections that probably should have been officially challenged perhaps even by a congressional investigation in a more fundamental sense american democracy has been derailed throughout the bush cheney regime the dominant commitment of the administration has been a murderous illegal nonsensical war against iraq that irresponsible venture has killed almost 4 000 americans left many times that number mentally or physically crippled claimed the lives of an estimated 600 000 iraqis according to a careful october 2006 study from the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health and laid waste their country the financial cost to the united states is now 250 million a day and is expected to exceed a total of 1 trillion most of which we have borrowed from the chinese and others as our national debt has now climbed above 9 trillion by far the highest in our national history
8242802 all of this has been done without the declaration of war from congress that the constitution clearly requires in defiance of the u n charter and in violation of international law this reckless disregard for life and property as well as constitutional law has been accompanied by the abuse of prisoners including systematic torture in direct violation of the geneva conventions of 1949
8242803 the poll indicated 69 percent of democrats favored impeaching bush while just 13 percent of republicans showed support among independents 50 percent wanted to impeach the president the study was based on telephone calls july 3 5 american research group said 933 of the people interviewed were registered voters with a simple majority vote the house can impeach presidents and vice presidents for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors conviction and removal from office requires a two thirds majority vote by the senate
8242804 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8242805 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8242806 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8242807 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8242808 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8242809 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8242810 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8242811 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8242812 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8242813 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8242814 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8242815 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8242816 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8242817 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8242818 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8242819 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8242820 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8242821 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8242822 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8242823 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8242824 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8242825 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8242826 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8242827 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8242828 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8242829 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8242830 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8242831 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8242832 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8242833 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8242834 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8242835 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8242836 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8242837 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8242838 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8242839 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8242840 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8242841 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8242842 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8242843 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8242844 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8242845 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8242846 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8242847 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8242848 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8242849 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8242850 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8242851 underlines once again that in such cases ferrari is treated with kid gloves
8242852 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8242853 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8242854 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8242855 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8242856 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8242857 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8242858 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8242859 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8242860 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8242861 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8242862 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8242863 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8242864 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8242865 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8242866 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8242867 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8242868 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8242869 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8242870 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8242871 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8242872 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8242873 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8242874 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8242875 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8242876 worship became one of the strongest things i would do in my life he told cerullo and the audience during the show
8242877 every time the doctors would test me i was singing a gospel song i gave it back to god
8242878 they ran the test on me the very same people that told me i tested positive told me i was completely negative he said the television show he says he no longer takes the doctor prescribed medicine for hiv
8242879 i want people to know that god definitely cannot lie and cannot fail he said
8242880 when you turn your life over to him know that god is going to work things out for your life
8242881 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8242882 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

8242977 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8242978 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8242979 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8243057 we are putting on public notice to the minneapolis police department that those squad car videos need to be preserved in unedited form
8243058 this is absolutely outrageous behavior by the police department towards individuals who are engaged in protected first amendment activity and have a record of exposing police misconduct
8243059 these types of incidents happen frequently the difference now is that people are watching them witnessing and giving testimony
8243060 its a straight out challenge its not really a coincidence that they went after someone who had a history of exposing just this kind of behavior by the police

8243077 because of the differences in graphical prowess between it and the hd consoles wiis unique controller interface and a recognition by publishers that they have to be a little cuter in which games they use to target the wii userbase
8243078 in terms of potential for revenue generation ones eye is always drawn towards recognisable licenses when assessing release lists of new ips
8243079 ubisofts hells kitchen and segas beijing title might ride current waves of popular interest while i personally hope thqs de blob achieves some measure of success because it looks like a quirky and fun title exactly the kind of innovative and refreshing gameplay i want on wii
8243080 however even the most charitable observer would be hard pressed not to wonder at the quality of some of the new ips set for wii this quarter
8243081 it begs the question as to why publishers dont solely focus on their established ip games publishing not unlike the music business is a hits driven business
8243082 publishers use established sellers to keep the accountants happy while they take risks on new ips and development strategies one hopes will work but naturally some will invariably fail
8243083 in the longer term new ip generation is essential for the ongoing health of a publisher because consumers can become jaded with even the hottest properties not to mention development teams while a constantly growing catalogue of proven internally owned ip broadens a publishers strategic options principally making less risky sequels
8243084 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

8243101 we have maintained the momentum of our top line growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment
8243102 these results are more or less in line with expectations although i think the outlook for volumes is somewhat disappointing

8243110 his physical problems are unlikely to disturb his fitness programme and we expect him to make a full recovery for both the monza test and next weeks belgian gp
8243111 at 8 a m on saturday i received a phone call from the teams doctor aki hintsa telling me that lewis was in some difficulties
8243112 hed woken up with a severe migraine and with his neck in spasm
8243113 aki treated lewis but when he arrived at the circuit on saturday morning he could barely move his neck at all so things looked very severe
8243114 as a precaution we readied reserve driver pedro de la rosa to take over but despite delaying his start to saturday practice lewis was able to continue with his full race programme
8243115 the narrow margin between the two leagues may be closed if the german clubs competing in the champions league achieve better results than the italian clubs earning higher uefa prize money
8243116 people are always going between the houses and we know that people go in and out of that one
8243117 since the plywood went up i know some of it has been removed
8243118 the city fixed it once and thats good but people are still in and out all the time its dangerous
8243119 we wanted them property owners to do something but they didnt so now were going ahead with our procedure to demolish
8243120 the name change was instituted to better convey to our business audience who we are and what our core business is
8243121 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8243122 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a byword for brilliance
8243123 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8243124 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8243125 urlwire was a key reason we attracted over 3 000 links to the earthday web event

8243127 as long as it rains slowly it should be all right
8243128 we dont want it all to come within a few hours
8243129 when we get a downpour over a few hours then the ground cant absorb all the moisture
8243130 it needs to be a slow rain where the ground can absorb it this looks like its going to be nice and steady
8243131 then it becomes a much more showerly pattern over wednesday night and thursday morning
8243132 were looking at 1 to 3 inches over a 48 hour time span
8243133 we had a few days where it didnt get above 85 degrees
8243134 water evaporated at a much slower rate when it started to get hot over the last couple days you could really see things wilt anyone who had any plants could probably tell you they started watering them like crazy over the last few days
8243135 but i dont think that it was planted early enough that it will be much help
8243136 we probably had enough moisture in june that it didnt force the corn crop to root down like it would have if it were dry
8243137 that probably contributes to the fact that it doesnt have enough of a root system to support the dry period here in august
8243138 for any one person to have 1 000 animals on their property here is just beyond my wildest imagination
8243139 i hope this will make our communities and legal system more aware of the crisis were facing
8243140 there needs to be spay and neuter laws created and enforced and regulations on how many pets you can own
8243141 you see it on tv but to actually be in the shelter and just see row after row of cages some stacked on top of each other its more than you could imagine
8243142 and all the dogs are coming to the front of the cages and jumping up and wanting attention they havent had that human contact
8243143 they had plenty of manpower and pretty much had everything under control
8243144 i just want to go and give the puppies some attention
8243145 i think its so sad that theyve been neglected and just used for breeding thats so many dogs

8243174 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8243175 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
8243176 there is no blockade any ship can get in american and others are bringing in humanitarian cargoes and what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8243177 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and stability in the caucasus
8243178 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe isolation is looming
8243179 russias actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation in direct violation of international law
8243180 the russian federation is seeking to validate the use of violence direct military aggression and ethnic cleansing to forcibly change the borders of a neighbouring state
8243181 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8243182 saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives by doing so he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians in a single state
8243183 absolutely inevitable short of losing our dignity as a nation
8243184 the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8243185 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
8243186 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
8243187 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
8243188 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
8243189 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
8243190 we are worried that we are facing under the strong arm of russia a situation where some kind of understanding would be reached that russia would be given a free hand in the region
8243191 what do you think the implications of signing this deal now
8243192 moyra was an amazing woman im not as sentimental as she was was about these sort of things but i would be nice to see the cake go to a good home i heard the last slice went for a fortune so that would be great for our charity
8243193 this piece is special because it was from the cake sent to the queen mother at clarence house
8243194 the first few games were difficult for me i think im almost 100 hopefully the next game i will get better
8243195 i didnt have a lot of pre season with fiorentina just one week so i came here and was a bit short of fitness and i played just one game before the season against colchester
8243196 they both played with me for arsenal reserves and we played a few carling cup games as well theyre both great players
8243197 this is being done simply to save the state money and thats not a good argument for managed care
8243198 this is not about saving money this is about using the money we spend to purchase better quality coverage for medicaid patients
8243199 we used to have 6 500 doctors in medicaid managed care ready to serve the needs of hiv aids patients now we have 13 000 most medicaid fee for service providers serving aids patients are joining managed care networks to continue the doctor patient relationship

8243383 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum
8243384 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8243385 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8243386 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working

8243440 i havent spent the past 35 years in thetrenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people

8243448 there is a high level of absenteeism recently a house break in was reported but there was no one at the station to attend to the complaint help arrived three hours later the crime prevention unit had to attend to it
8243449 the occupant of the house was tied up and goods stolen from the house people will try to deny that this is happening but it is in fact people at all stations are not happy
8243450 if we drag our feet we do so at the communitys expense i dont even know what the criteria are because mostly whites get rewarded
8243451 i spoke to a detective who cracked many cases and had not been rewarded but another detective who dealt with compiling police dockets which is an easy task got rewarded every year
8243452 i didnt work the whole of last week after learning who received the rewards because i was disheartened im going to apply for a reward but it would be better if the scheme was abandoned because its causing more harm than good
8243453 the saps has its own policy called pep which is a good policy because it should be clear in terms of procedure that cop x is being rewarded because of reasons 1 2 and 3
8243454 in terms of implementation theres a lot of favouritism objective judging isnt prevalent if you are in the station commissioners good books youll get the incentive
8243455 it was implemented as a national instruction which is changed regularly if it had been a collective instruction proper criteria acceptable to everyone would have been set
8243456 mostly high ranking officers get the incentives the whole process is so flawed we are getting no joy
8243457 what we have been able to glean is that the journalists the canadian the australian and the somali are unharmed they have their clothes theyre getting food regularly and they may even have access to satellite tv
8243458 i cant say more than that you can understand that the group may be afraid of a possible armed mission to rescue the journalists
8243459 but the way things have gone in somalia from what we know and from what weve seen in the past thats not necessarily a bad thing that theres been no demand yet
8243460 in the case of some italian aid workers kidnapped a while ago in somalia it took seven to 10 days before any contact was made so you see were still early on
8243461 somalia is a dangerous place there are a lot of various factions and many of them have guns its a confusing place
8243462 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8243463 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8243464 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8243465 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8243466 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8243467 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals

8243470 its a big honour for lena to be remembered for her work but my family and i are quite sad that the spelling is incorrect

8243476 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8243477 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8243478 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8243479 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8243480 the us is bad off demographically but most of the rest of the world is worse off the us has a problem because it has not been saving but that is largely because much of the rest of the world is neo mercantilist and is subsidizing export industries and the us buys
8243481 boomers will need to labor longer and they should do so
8243482 to the extent that this causes labor shortages the us will see greater employment prospects for its people
8243483 you dont have to care for us weve found people who will do it more cheaply

8243499 this is a bit linear but has the virtue of identifying future trends not things that are around today
8243500 this reality will not just be a simulation of reality rather what will emerge as the combination of the two is a kind of hyper reality where objects exist both in the physical world and the digital world

8243509 students need to give investigating officers the correct information because if they leave out crucial information then we are unable to continue with the investigations
8243510 investigations into the students death will not be taken any further since the post mortem results indicate that the deceased died of natural causes and there was no sign of police involvement in the matter
8243511 nobody has bothered to tell us the cause of my brothers death and we have heard rumours that his heart and liver were swollen
8243512 i find it very strange that my brother suddenly developed breathing problems during the day of the protest and died just as the police were dispersing protesting students there are so many questions that have not been answered
8243513 we suggested to the police that we should control the students because they would listen to us however the police just sprayed chemicals directly on to our faces and that is what caused nkwanyanas death
8243514 i was examined by the doctor because i also had trouble breathing after the police spayed chemicals on to my face
8243515 at no time did police use pepper spray or teargas the south african police service no longer uses teargas we verbally warned them to disperse and they did so
8243516 we take this situation very seriously and we are very sorry this happened
8243517 all individuals who may have been affected by this incident have been individually contacted by letter and appropriate authorities and agencies notified fortunately the school divisions investigation has produced no evidence to date that this information was actually accessed by anyone during the period in question other than the security specialist who first alerted us to its presence

8243525 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8243526 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain

8243529 a well known member of clan korval portrayed as others see them
8243530 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president

8243578 un libro en el que se revela como los astronautas estadounidenses y sus colegas rusos practicaron sexo en el espacio para determinar cu les eran las posturas sexuales m s adecuadas
8243579 no podemos esperar a que se establezcan las causas de la intoxicaci n y debemos actuar de forma preventiva
8243580 lo busquen en todas las comunidades aut nomas de espa a y en la uni n
8243581 ya que estamos aplicando todas las medidas preventivas y est n activados todos los servicios de consumo
8243582 se vogliamo abbiamo i numeri per andare avanti da soli per meglio trovare un accordo con tutti inclusi i sindaci che dovranno gestire la riforma ce ne sono di bravi anche a sinistra
8243583 non bisogna farlo per forza laccordo ma meglio perch preferibile non incendiare gli animi se si possono mantenere i rapporti
8243584 il nostro federalismo una riforma che va bene per tutti
8243585 non sono cos contrario anche se casini un po rompiballe e vuole essere inseguito lasciamo fare a berlusconi per me lunica cosa importante il federalismo e e se casini lo vota va bene anche casini se passa il federalismo gli offro il mio ministero
8243586 una volta passato il federalismo che ci sto a fare
8243587 siano presenti quelli che pagano e cio le regioni che versano i soldi in favore delle altre perch le regioni che pagano devono poter controllare come viene speso il denaro invece adesso i soldi non hanno vincoli vengono trasferiti senza una destinazione precisa per questo se ne sono persi tanti
8243588 prima avevamo a che fare con i musulmani ora con lislam cio con una comunit che non distingue politica religiosa e culturale ed inconciliabile con il nostro sistema giuridico
8243589 vogliamo bilanci trasparenti niente fondi dallestero magari da terroristi neppure un euro dallo stato lo statuto dei proponenti dovr riconoscere la laicit dello stato e la famiglia monogamica
8243590 non vogliamo che continui cos che nasca una moschea ogni quattro ore
8243591 noi lo chiediamo con forza c una coesione nella maggioranza e ci auguriamo anche una disponibilit della sinistra
8243592 e previsto che ci sia anche questa tranche il superamento del bicameralismo perfetto con la realizzazione di un senato federale accompaganto da una riduzione del numero dei parlamentari ma limportante approvare il federalismo fiscale senza il quale non ci sono le risorse per far funzionare le riforme costituzionali
8243593 e da discutere se prendiamo come riferimento la bozza violante prevede che il premier abbia pi poteri ad esempio anche quello di revocare i ministri e poi che venga nominato dal presidente della repubblica tenendo conto del risultato delle elezioni c cos una costituzionalizzazione di quello che oggi gi di fatto
8243594 lo vedremo abbiamo sempre pensato che la corte costituzionale dovesse essere rappresentativa anche delle regioni e dei territori
8243595 su sicurezza e immigrazione siamo impegnati il ministro maroni ha lavorato molto bene dobbiamo sostenere lazione del governo nellapplicazione della legge bossi fini sullimmigrazione e un maggiore controllo bisogna arrivare allapplicazione a regime di tutti i suoi principi e dei provvedimenti necessari nellesercitare lazione di contrasto si tratta di provvedimenti che il governo varer per assicurare la certezza della pena contenuti nel pacchetto sicurezza
8243596 spingiamo anche per un federalismo sulla sicurezza la chiave di volta quindi sempre pi poteri ai sindaci su questo andremo avanti
8243597 porteremo in parlamento il dibattito su come andr impostata la scuola in futuro primo punto concorsi completamente regionalizzati cos la finiamo con la migrazione del personale da sud a nord e in questo modo ci sar anche un personale che conoscer meglio la realt del territorio secondo punto dibattito sui libri di testo in un momento di crisi come questo i continui cambiamenti dei testi sono una cosa assurda chiederemo che vengano mantenuti per lintero ciclo scolatisco almeno cinque anni obbligatoriamente i testi devono durare non vanno cambiati ogni anno se ci sono variazioni si possono segnalare con delle appendici la corsa al continuo cambio dei libri di testo penalizza soltanto le famiglie
8243598 una mia opinione personale che il testo potrebbe essere fornito dallistituto almeno per la scuola dellobbligo
8243599 se ne parli siamo disponibili facendo riferimento alle norme volute da falcone berlusconi ha iniziato con il piede giusto ci sono tante cose di cui dover parlare un argomento complesso per esempio c il tema della giustizia civile perch un imprenditore che non ha tempi certi per il soddisfacimento dei suoi crediti va in difficolt la competitivit del sistema economico legata anche a una giustizia che consenta di recuperare i propri crediti e di avere ragione in sede civile
8243600 noi siamo sempre stati a favore della separazione delle carriere si discuter di tutto
8243601 mentre il popolo della libert sostanzialmente fermo ai valori delle politiche 37 4 la lega nord salita ulteriormente e dall8 3 del 13 14 aprile si trova ora tra il 10 e il 12 aumenta lastensione da parte degli elettori di centrosinistra e quindi la platea dei votanti si restringe per questo motivo cresce la percentuale del carroccio se si votasse in questo momento il partito democratico andrebbe maluccio non benissimo certamente sotto il 30 litalia dei valori di antonio di pietro prende tutto quello che non va pi al pd e si trova tra il 6 e il 7 ludc stabile tiene i voti delle elezioni sul 5 5 5 e infine larea della sinistra arcobaleno non ha recuperato nulla dalle politiche
8243602 the decision of where to send aid was made at the highest level of the pentagon and the only decision was to send it to batumi

8243605 hillary deserves one big thank you and shes got one
8243606 deve essere radiato dalla magistratura quel magistrato che non deposita in tempo una sentenza e il mafioso esce dal carcere
8243607 in primo piano ce linteresse dei cittadini ad ottenere giustizia in tempi decenti per quanto riguarda sia la giustizia civile sia quella penale
8243608 no ma io se faccio le cose che girano vomito lanima
8243609 mondo giove perch non lo dicono che quello un gioco veramente pericoloso dove ci si puo fare tanto ma tanto male
8243610 scusi quel signore c un posto dove mangiare qui vicino
8243611 we are governed by the communications and multimedia act 1998 which allows us to take preventive measures and advise our license holders such as isps when a service user may be contravening national laws
8243612 we are not against blogs but we would like to see ethical blogging
8243613 well i cant help but love her she pretty much is the best thing out there for a young black female
8243614 the team s access to ufo evidence is unparalleled and their expertise allows them to quickly identify bogus claims of ufos
8243615 we are looking at an australian ufo episode for the next season that s for sure
8243616 we found 38 per cent of mature men and 29 per cent of mature women were having sex more than once a week
8243617 that s a significant amount of older men and women having a lot of sex perhaps more than many of us suspected
8243618 these people are not frothy young singles out at the clubs having hot casual sex
8243619 they re more likely to be at home with their loved one in front of the fire so in that respect it s quite impressive
8243620 for a lot of these women their sex drive isn t like what they see on sex and the city or read about in romance novels so they think there s something wrong with them when it s totally normal
8243621 fue algo muy lindo haber podido jugar con federer aqu esta noche es algo que no me voy a poder olvidar nunca
8243622 no se averigua el problema puntual en el rea competente
8243623 hoy no s lo no tiene una sola complicaci n sino que est operando normalmente
8243624 here is absolutely nothing going on in terms of signing with anybody in f1
8243625 theres not even any negotiations in that sense first i still have to understand who has the best options for me to follow then we can start negotiating but at the moment were still seeking those best options
8243626 im doing all the things i have to do chatting to the right people in the f1 paddock and well see how it turns out
8243627 lets say the only team i havent spoken to at all is ferrari so theres no real logical place for me to go yet
8243628 weve spoken to many many people about the best option in both the short and long terms theres no point in doing something for next year and then having nothing for 2010 or 2011
8243629 its a tough time now it might look very good because people are saying hes looking good in gp2 and hes obviously going to f1 but really where how i need to find a space a good space
8243630 at the moment im considering everything preferably a race drive would be a better option because i dont want to stop racing for a whole year
8243631 running first will be really difficult its so deep its not going to start to sweep clean for a good three or four cars
8243632 its quite strange we were all expecting loads of mud around but because the roads are close to the sea the wind has dried them off quickly
8243633 we had some trouble with the power steering on one car and the engine on the next
8243634 it didnt cost us any time though and it wont affect us on the rally
8243635 jump on a wall just to see them all land on the ground such a gorgeus sound
8243636 its tricky this but the grid will look great so its worth it didnt i read an interview with ivan brunetti where he was saying how he liked to arrange wee graphical elements into grids yes it was him in that book of interviews with comic guys that i bought yes ivan brunetti colin gave me that book of his collected comics that was really good wasnt it yes but did i mention to colin that id liked it no hmm thats bad i meant to but i didnt i should have could i thank him now after all these months yes better call him i suppose im always saying that i should call people but i never do bad why do i never call people when i know that i should because im a terrible person thats why very bad oh thats all very depressing concentrate on the print diarmid instead of all this self indulgent recrimination work work
8243637 we had an agreement to have a somewhat open relationship and actually being involved in a game online was a very safe way to do that
8243638 you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain
8243639 i believe that for every dream a dream stimulus may be found among those experiences
8243640 we are working on it and we want to make sure we get it right
8243641 thank you for this the gold medal in the lib dem olympics
8243642 im with chris hoy im comfortable and confident in being part of a federal political party team lib dem scottish mps msps meps and councillors across the country working together to build a stronger party
8243643 team scott as with our athletes has only won because of the support staff like chris hoy victory would not have been achieved without them thank you
8243644 today i am clear in my mind about the challenge ahead
8243645 and when they stop i am determined that the liberal democrats will be a dominant presence on the political landscape
8243646 our values of community liberty and fairness locked into 21st century scotland
8243647 after less than eighteen months in government the snp is riding high in the polls
8243648 we can already see underlying weaknesses that will undo alex salmond
8243649 will be seen as arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow
8243650 the other day mr salmond ended weeks of dither by announcing what he would do to help the housing market
8243651 this is the man who attacks gordon brown with venom
8243652 when scotland votes in the coming election people will be looking for a party that understands their needs that offers solutions to their problems and that is ready to lead throughout scotland
8243653 i made it clear during this leadership campaign that i wont rest until it is crystal clear that the scottish liberal democrats fit that bill
8243654 my election today is not a prescription for more of the same
8243655 change that locks in liberal values thats why well continue to make the case for protecting our environment improving our public services and taking back our civil liberties
8243656 but if this party is to take advantage of the changing political climate we must move outside our comfort zone away from the holyrood bubble
8243657 we must engage individuals families and communities about the problems that they face in their daily lives
8243658 and we must provide the big ideas the practical solutions that will make life easier for them
8243659 and real solutions for families who are struggling to meet the rising cost of food and fuel solutions for scotland
8243660 i want our party to turn to those issues with renewed energy and vigour
8243661 to speak with business and industry to the academic and voluntary sectors to campaign and consumer groups
8243662 to ensure that the scottish parliament has the powers to act or the foresight to devolve power to communities and individuals so that they can take decisions for themselves
8243663 a place where people come together and work to solve the problems facing our community
8243664 not just because we need to but because we want to
8243665 i will bring a little bit of shetland to the leadership
8243666 i will work day and night to build the team produce the ideas and grow the party that will earn scotlands trust
8243667 the liberal democrats contributed the brightest and the best ideas in scotlands first eight years of devolution
8243668 that the successes we have achieved are a starting point and not an end
8243669 im grateful to have received the support of so many liberal democrats from across scotland
8243670 its a particular honour to have won given the choice that party members had
8243671 ross finnie and mike rumbles are formidable candidates who have fought excellent campaigns
8243672 and i very much look forward to working with them to take our party forward in the months and years ahead
8243673 building on the dedicated work and commitment of nicol stephen and i would like to thank him on behalf of all our party
8243674 alistair carmichael has managed my campaign to him my gratitude
8243675 tomorrow i look forward to cheering scotlands olympic athletes in edinburgh
8243676 i m marching because of the treatment hillary received during the primaries she was treated so unfairly by the media and
8243677 obama wasn t elected he was selected if you look at all the caucus fraud you ll see his delegate lead was only in the red states she won the popular vote and she should be the nominee
8243678 we re here to represent hillary clinton and show her that we re not going to follow the party line like we ve always done
8243679 these people are trying to scare us about roe v wade well you know what i am beyond my reproductive years i don t care it s time for these young obama women who think it s so cool to support him they can worry about their own reproductive rights
8243680 one of the basic fundamental platforms of the dnc is against sexism
8243681 antisemitism let s have a little bit of that or next time let s have a little bit of racism or maybe have a little bit of gay bashing next time
8243682 these people are trying to scare us about roe v wade well you know what i am beyond my reproductive years i don t care it s time for these young obama women who think it s so cool to support him they can worry about their own reproductive rights
8243683 its a good thing you dont get to be president like you get a job in the real world obamas interview would either be extremely short or he would try to smooth talk his way into the position and from the way things are looking now fail miserably hillary 2012
8243684 if i worked at a company and it was bleeding money failing miserably and the president of the company didnt know which way is up a candidate that interviewed and tells me as his interviewer
8243685 i want to be a hardworking mp fighting for fife taking up the concerns of people across the area
8243686 i will speak out on the issues that matter to local people such as the levels of crime especially anti social behaviour tackling the spiralling cost of living and i will fight for more local jobs within the local communities
8243687 local people are feeling let down by gordon browns labour government that is out of touch and has forgotten the people of fife
8243688 many local people were hit by the labour government when they doubled the 10p tax rate whereas the liberal democrats are planning to cut the basic rate of income tax
8243689 equally local people are getting fed up of the broken promises by the snp in edinburgh at westminster the snp are irrelevant
8243690 the scottish liberal democrat campaign is already off to a flying start we already have a headquarters in markinch and will campaign in every part of the constituency liberal democrat leader nick clegg will be visiting the area
8243691 local people want to know who is the best person to represent fife harry wills will make a superb mp for the people of glenrothes
8243692 voglio far capire alle persone che non sono sole so come ci si sente completamente da soli e senza nessun aiuto lultima cosa che vuoi sentirti dire in quei momenti vedrai che tutto andr bene lunica cosa che pu davvero aiutarti che qualcun altro che si sentito cos ti parli della sua situazione

8243704 we also design new online services for our clients and provide consultancy on the processes methods and thinking required to implement digitally healthy technologies
8243705 we make money via our current focus of delivering productivity training and digital life coaching as group workshops and one to one sessions again we also consult on and design digitally healthy technologies
8243706 each group workshop and one to one session are facilitated in such a way that much of the content and solutions are driven by the group this makes it harder for the facilitator but much more effective and worthwhile for the individual and less like a lecture which helps keep us on our toes
8243707 weve just launched so really its to make ourselves known to the people who may need us most for example getting in touch with the right people heads of human resources and internal communications at large organisations so we can understand their specific problems
8243708 there are still a lot of new companies creating stuff just because they can rather than thinking of what they deliver as something that has to be meaningful enough for individuals or companies to regularly pay for it we know this because of our own experiences with running our own start up rememble com it feels like the real concept of business is more integrated with web companies now so more of a dot com ball rather than bubble
8243709 going to see a company to discuss partnering the guy kept running out of the meeting to shout at his employees and would come back popping with rage i thought he was going to have a heart attack scarily messy office i quickly fled

8243712 when even former alberta premier peter lougheed who started the tar sands ball rolling is calling for change you know this is a major disaster
8243713 ottawa is letting the tar sands hold canadians hostage on global warming
8243714 the federal government is not using laws already on the books to require companies to reduce emissions and clean up their toxic mess
8243715 and without clean water we wouldnt exist now the boss is in trouble and needs our help
8243716 nobody lives closer to the land and water than we do and weve seen bad changes over the past dozen years
8243717 as goes the water so go we and we are seeing strange diseases now
8243718 our federal elected leaders need to clean it up or shut it down
8243719 had the litigants indicated that a negotiated solution was foreseeable in the near future the court may have stayed its hand but there is still ample time for the parties to reach an accommodation the courts july 31 2008 order does not compel ms miers to appear at any particular date

8243795 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8243796 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8243797 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8243798 i ran to stand up for all those who had been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8243799 she wants the 18 million people who believed in her that he will put forth those things those policies that shes cared about all of her adult life will go forward with him
8243800 a lot of us have been waiting for this time and i think when she comes out here and gives her full support behind barack obama i think that will help a lot of her supporters

8243806 if we leave this convention on thursday saying barack gave great speech michelle was awesome but im still concerned about the hillary factor that would be a profound problem going into the fall campaign and it simply cannot happen
8243807 in this battle against terrorism we got to not only win the military battle but weve got to win battle of hearts and minds

8243811 both parties are to blame for getting us into this war and both are to blame for keeping our us there
8243812 a lot of americans voted for democrats in 2006 because of promises they made to bring our troops home and then we watched those very elected officials continue to fund the occupation of iraq
8243813 to bring awareness to americans veterans and civilians alike of the growing number of war veterans against the occupation
8243814 but we also want to let the american people know that we have to hold our politicians accountable no matter what their political affiliation they are we demand accurate representation of the will of the people by our government and the majority of this country wants immediate withdrawal from iraq

8244002 unfortunate events have taken place in orissa in recent days
8244003 these began with the senseless killing of hindu swami laxmanananda saraswati on aug 23
8244004 i am disappointed by the false claim that christians have responsibility for this murder and i am saddened by the atrocities being visited on christians in orissa
8244005 all christian villages are empty in kandhamal as christians old and young sick and pregnant mothers are hiding in forests exposed to the non stop monsoon rains without food
8244006 we are all under immense danger and threat from these groups please continue to uphold us in your prayer particularly for the safety of christian brothers and sisters who are now hiding themselves in jungles
8244007 respect for the principle of religious liberty and the sacredness of human life requires nothing less
8244008 i also appeal to all baptists worldwide to pray gods protection for our brothers and sisters in orissa
8244009 now we have no request except prayer from our baptist world as we do not know how to face tomorrow

8244013 our companys substantial net asset value is not reflected in our stock price
8244014 the share repurchase program capitalizes on this opportunity to materially benefit our shareholders
8244015 coachs strong financial condition allows us to take advantage of opportunities to purchase our securities at attractive prices particularly considering our excellent long term outlook
8244016 based on our healthy balance sheet and strong operating cash flows we believe we can increase long term shareholder value and offset dilution from employee stock programs by buying back stock while at the same time retaining the strategic and operational flexibility to invest appropriately in our business

8244020 zodra foute bgp informatie dus eenmaal in de kern van het internet is doorgedrongen kan je er weinig anders aan doen dan de aanval onderkennen door op zoek te gaan naar dingen die afwijken van de normale gang van zaken
8244021 internetproviders moeten hun klanten goed filteren het hele probleem met youtube en pakistan was ook een gevolg van gebrek aan klantfiltering het probleem is alleen dat zolang er nog een paar isps niet goed filteren een vastberaden aanvaller op zoek naar zon isp kan gaan en daarmee bgp opzetten waarna ze vrijwel onbeperkt hun gang kunnen gaan tot iemand het opmerkt en ze opgespoord worden of de isp die het doorlaat door anderen wordt uitgefilterd

8244023 finding common ground between muslims and christians is not simply a matter for polite ecumenical dialogue between selected religious leaders christianity and islam are the largest and second largest religions in the world and in history christians and muslims reportedly make up over a third and over a fifth of humanity respectively together they make up more than 55 percent of the worlds population making the relationship between these two religious communities the most important factor in contributing to meaningful peace around the world
8244024 if muslims and christians are not at peace the world cannot be at peace with the terrible weaponry of the modern world with muslims and christians intertwined everywhere as never before no side can unilaterally win a conflict between more than half of the worlds inhabitants
8244025 thus our common future is at stake the very survival of the world itself is perhaps at stake
8244026 it is important to break down the fear of each other within both communities of faith and for us to counter those who would create and play upon our fear of each other as we develop the basis for building just and sustainable communities together

8244031 no one knows mitt romney better than the massachusetts delegation

8244033 he was so unpopular when he left massachusetts people were so disappointed

8244035 wed tell him to go home if we knew which home he was coming from
8244036 the fact that this has come down to mitt romney shows how short the list of vice presidential candidates is for the republican party
8244037 the thing about mitt is he can have debate all by himself he doesnt need to come here to denver
8244038 he can debate both sides of all the important issues just by quoting his past statements

8244052 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8244053 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8244054 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8244055 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8244056 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8244072 im not trying to get you riled up im not the one that fucking did it im the one that saw it
8244073 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8244074 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8244075 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8244076 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8244077 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8244078 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8244079 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8244080 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8244089 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8244090 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia

8244107 i think its a bit shocking for all of us because with that ruling it sets a precedent now
8244108 i guess therell be nothing of the sort bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a real bad one it sets a precedent now
8244109 any interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required

8244114 i think whether they bring stirling into inside centre or timana theyve both got the ability to ball play

8244123 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8244124 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8244125 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

8244140 we believe this addition to mitos product line creates an excellent opportunity for consumers to gain immediate access to this highly desirable safety and convenience feature

8244142 esi is very pleased to be a part of this important project which links our major markets and helps to monitor environmental conditions and protect ecologically sensitive areas that play an important role in oil production

8244145 we expect that the audit and the related review of our financial controls and systems will soon be complete

8244149 with the tremendous growth and fast changing circumstances we were facing we had heavy demands for a new finance application
8244150 we explored our options in great detail and ultimately decided on intacct intacct offered us the best of breed approach we wanted and we were confident that they would work well with our existing salesforce com crm applications
8244151 while quickbooks is a great product for small businesses growing companies like ngenera all eventually need to graduate to a more advanced system
8244152 mid sized companies that require robust global business management capabilities have historically found themselves stuck in the chasm between quickbooks and high cost complex on premises financial management software from companies like oracle and sap intaccts software as a service financial applications offer a compelling solution that is better faster cheaper and can scale with them from life after quickbooks to going public and beyond
8244153 with intacct even as a mid sized company were able to cost effectively take advantage of all the financial controls that only large organizations have in the past had access to the efficiencies weve gained with intacct plus help us accommodate organic growth without adding resources to the finance team
8244154 even better weve now got a single view into our business across departments and geographic regions enabling us to more effectively manage our finances to support our long term strategic objectives
8244155 its incredible to have all of our critical business applications seamlessly integrated and on demand
8244156 intact provides us faster access to information such as revenue projections cash flow and accounts payable and receivable simply because all of our business entities are on one system information that used to take days to find is now accessible within minutes

8244166 he had a very good club in west ham dont get me wrong but sometimes when a player comes through the ranks and they get to 23 24 they get to a bit of a crossroads and think which road am i going to go on
8244167 he maybe needs a change and the environment and coaches weve got can certainly take him to another level there is no reason why he cant go on and become a top top player
8244168 international football definitely but that is down to the player
8244169 fear of losing coverage keeps people at jobs many workers will keep hanging on to jobs they hate
8244170 an employer that does not offer health benefits must offer higher cash wages to compete for workers workers who choose the job with health coverage bear the cost of that benefit in the form of higher cash wages forgone

8244172 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 40 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
8244173 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community
8244174 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
8244175 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

8244271 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan

8244361 investors are expected to keep a close watch on the storm as it progresses towards the gulf of mexico

8244363 although recent measures of inflation are higher than i would like to see i would say that recent price increases are more likely to be transitory than persistent
8244364 i expect that cpi inflation will peak near the july level of 5 6
8244365 taken as a whole these measures suggest inflation expectations may have risen modestly but not by a material degree
8244366 by that i mean not sufficient for me to think fed policies have been off target with respect to the central banks responsibility for price stability

8244391 i couldnt say because if someone has promised me to cheslea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8244392 im kidding of course ive always said that im happy at milan and as long as i have the same objectives as milan ill stay here thats the way its always been
8244393 my aim is to win and thats the same with milan as you can see by the effort theyve made in that direction strengthening the squad in such a way that this will always be a team of winners as long as thats the case ill be staying
8244394 people say were not interested in winning the uefa cup this group has won everything we could possibly win
8244395 these will be our rivals throughout the season but there are always surprises fiorentina are a team that have been playing together for some time now and last season they had a great year and they could repeat that and then well see if there are any other surprise packages
8244396 well just trace the call and see where its coming from
8244397 its your telephone number the calls are coming from inside the house
8244398 we regret this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8244399 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8244400 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8244401 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8244402 some ukrainian politicians are working hard to trigger a crisis in our relations they sort of tease us hoping that we will respond toughly which they think will raise the wave of healthy nationalism this is a cynical and dangerous game
8244403 we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base
8244404 our policy has not changed we aim to enter the pan european system of security because we are convinced that today there is no other alternative way of protecting ukraines territorial integrity her sovereignty

8244408 what the heck is wuauclt and whats it got to do with me
8244409 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8244410 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8244411 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8244412 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8244413 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8244414 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8244415 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8244416 to fully surround russia with the help of nato in the caucasus and ukraine and turn the black sea into an american lake
8244417 in the end it seems to me that will lead to a balanced international system in which very obviously it will be impossible not to take account of russia or to humiliate her by gradually pushing her out of the sphere of european influence
8244418 russia simply acknowledged the real situation georgia did not control those territories and there was no hope for reunification
8244419 ich bin schon seit ein paar jahren nicht mehr in brands hatch gefahren aber ich liebe diese strecke
8244420 es ist ziemlich cool mal wieder ein aktuelles formel 1 auto dorthin zur ck zu bringen das letzte mal war glaube ich 1986 als nigel mansell dort den grand prix gewann
8244421 wenn ich mir am sonntag mit meiner familie das rennen anschaue dann werde ich mich f hlen wie vor drei jahren
8244422 wir haben die sommerpause genutzt um uns optimal auf brands hatch vorzubereiten aber auch um etwas urlaub zu machen und neue energie zu tanken
8244423 ich werde zwar nie so viele autogramme schreiben k nnen wie ich es gerne tun w rde aber ich will es versuchen mir ist es wichtig dazu die chance zu haben denn die unterst tzung der fans f r mich ist unglaublich und so etwas darf man nicht als selbstverst ndlich hinnehmen
8244424 der kontakt ist so eng weil die fans einfach tickets f r das fahrerlager kaufen k nnen
8244425 ich kann mich erinnern dass die runden immer ganz schnell vorbei sind
8244426 we understand that some people especially jewish people might be hurt by that but the truth is that both jews were denied the right to live and were slaughtered during the holocaust and so are those babies
8244427 the baby that was thought to be dead in israel and later recovered on the way to grave proves that they want to live and capable to survive some of our activists heard from people that those posters put them back to painful memories but we need to speak for those children

8244430 i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team
8244431 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the world cup
8244432 i was not too pleased i thought that will not happen again
8244433 well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it but we are expecting a very tough game
8244434 united are a very famous and a very strong opponent who we will treat with a lot of respect
8244435 this is like an exam which will show what our team is capable of
8244436 edinburgh is changing it is becoming a bigger city in every sense its being recognised as a force in urban cities in europe and in great britain
8244437 it also has the tram and the waterfront these are big changes
8244438 the changes arent being welded together the resources arent there to do it its reactive we are looking at each of the piecemeal bits and saying whether we like them or not
8244439 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8244440 the fact that all three charter schools were legally entitled to receive more funding than they needed to educate students underscores the critical need to fix the states charter school law immediately
8244441 the public is rightly concerned about rising property taxes and the escalating cost of education we need to reassure taxpayers that their hard earned dollars are being spent fairly and efficiently
8244442 because each school district pays an amount equal to its particular budgeted expenditures from the previous school year the payments get murkier when more schools are involved
8244443 the way the law is currently written if a charter school receives students from multiple districts each district could pay a different tuition rate for the same service this would lead to one district subsidizing another districts students
8244444 charter schools are an innovative and promising component of pennsylvanias education system
8244445 i call on gov rendell the general assembly and the department of education to work cooperatively to provide charter schools with the resources they need to educate their students and to ensure proper monitoring of their compliance with their mandates without placing additional hardships on traditional public schools and taxpayers
8244446 sbagliano i laici a chiedere ai credenti di lasciare la loro religione perch sostenere che gli uomini e le donne non debbano contaminare le loro moralit personali nei dibattiti pubblici una assurdit pratica perch la nostra legge per definizione una codificazione di moralit gran parte delle quali sono basate sulla tradizione giudaico cristiana

8244458 the relaxed group dont let email exert any pressure on their lives
8244459 they treat it exactly the way that one would treat the mail ill fetch it ill deal with it in my own time but im not going to let it upset me
8244460 both slot machines and email follow something called a variable interval reinforcement schedule
8244461 which has been established as the way to train in the strongest habits this means that rather than reward an action every time it is performed you reward it sometimes but not in a predictable way so with email usually when i check it there is nothing interesting but every so often theres something wonderful an invite out or maybe some juicy gossip and i get a reward
8244462 because they dont help people to change their behaviour while they are actually using email once your email is back youre going to respond to it in the same old ways unless you replace your bad habits
8244463 i use other tools where people are more comfortable hanging out ive got a whole set of contacts who love twitter and if i want to reach them quickly then thats where theyll be
8244464 ways of reducing the disruption caused by email ways of managing email so that it doesnt run your day organisational norms build up and people come to expect others to answer emails within a given timeframe whether that email is important or not

8244478 the half dozen chefs symbolize the militaristic precision and quasi religious ardor with which this restaurant approaches its mission
8244479 despite the agrarian vibe dishes on the succinct menu are intricately constructed and boldly embellished sometimes too much so the case with a prime hanger steak 29 blasted with a syrupy pepper sauce a better bet is basil crusted halibut 28 i found the kitchens performance inconsistent and on one visit the wait for food was ridiculously long especially since the restaurant wasnt crowded
8244480 it may sound unlikely but the best mofongo i ever had was at a place where the servers opening spiel lasted at least five minutes and included the phrase our cocktails are tapas style thankfully the mofongo was so good that it made up for the small annoyances of a night at macondo

8244483 for millions of hard working americans many of them women illness also means crushing debt half of all personal bankruptcies in this country are caused by catastrophic medical bills that is what happened to sue from beloit wisconsin
8244484 she told me my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer
8244485 sues story is common all across the country for eight long years weve had a president more concerned about the health of insurance companies than the health of the american people
8244486 for eight long years weve had a president more concerned about the health of insurance companies than the health of the american people john mccain is more of the same but we have a choice in this election
8244487 barack obama recognizes that good health care is as necessary to a productive society as a good education barack obama understands that investing in people restores the american dream and barack obama believes we can create a safer stronger healthier society
8244488 so much political rhetoric especially in washington is about legislation and policies
8244489 but when we tell stories about real people facing real traumas that helps other people to connect to the issues and to understand why it matters to be politically active
8244490 on this january night at this defining moment in history you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do

8244611 and i said why the heck am i doing this
8244612 this state is really becoming a playground of the wealthy we know it we cant deny it
8244613 and dont get me wrong i have nothing against wealthy trying my hardest to be one but to sit there and work on a three to five million dollar home for an owner that is going to be there for a couple of months in the summer and to think the guy thats working with me putting all this pride and sweat into that house is going to get less of a tax refund than that person who is going to come play here for a few months i tell ya it made me drive all night i speak for a lot of people the guys that work with their hands i had to come down and represent them
8244614 politics that champions issues that have a broad base of popular support but receive short shrift from the political elite
8244615 this explains why you can have left populists and right populists
8244616 this country is being destroyed from within by its own government
8244617 are running business out of this country faster than youll ever know
8244618 were losing our jobs and these are good paying union jobs
8244619 these politicians whore banging on large industry saying big business is bad
8244620 we want to stand for issues that often dont get heard over the din of money
8244621 denial of the opportunity for participation is the denial of human dignity and democracy
8244622 we have to go to people where they are on the issues they care about

8244625 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8244626 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8244627 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8244628 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8244629 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8244630 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8244631 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8244632 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president

8244638 ive done three films with them and they call it my trilogy of idiots
8244639 after reading the part which they said was hand written for myself i was not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8244640 by the way im starting to detect something in the crowd here a feeling that you all feel theres something wrong with being an idiot i just want to caution you about that because thats a sensitive subject and a big demographic
8244641 american cinema is very much at the centre of the programme
8244642 hemingway loved cuba because it was a place where he could be anonymous
8244643 somewhere he could live and write without being interfered with and bombarded for autographs
8244644 he seemed to have understood people and situations in a way that very few writers have
8244645 one of the things that irritates me about propagandists on my side is that they are often reluctant to spot a great victory even when they have just won one

8244653 no fim daquele per odo quando eu pensava em voltar para o meu trabalho como jornalista e para a vida acad mica j n o conseguia sentir entusiasmo
8244654 levei o ver o todo para decidir o que fazer a medita o foi o come o de uma longa jornada espiritual como eu era um aprendiz vagaroso e indisciplinado resolvi me tornar monge para continuar aquela jornada
8244655 a medita o nos deixa conscientes das sementes de viol ncia que est o dentro de n s
8244656 tr s d cadas de pesquisas mostraram que a medita o um bom ant doto ao estresse
8244657 agora o que est mira dos pesquisadores saber como a medita o pode treinar a mente e reformatar o c rebro
8244658 manter a mente quieta a espinha ereta e o cora o tranq ilo
8244659 focalizar a aten o no mundo interior como se faz na medita o uma situa o terap utica
8244660 queremos avaliar o alcance dessa pr tica e isol la de seu aspecto supersticioso
8244661 hoje a maioria das doen as causada por coisas como hipertens o obesidade e depend ncia qu mica que est o ligadas a padr es inadequados de comportamento
8244662 ao que parece estamos diante de um fen meno de marketing
8244663 meditar pode aliviar o estresse mas sua a o nunca ir al m disso no tratamento de doen as graves como o c ncer
8244664 s h pouco a psiquiatria ocidental reconheceu a exist ncia do transtorno do d ficit de aten o uma s ndrome caracterizada pela dificuldade de concentra o baixa toler ncia frustra o e impulsividade mas h milhares de anos tradi es como o budismo afirmam que todos sofremos desse dist rbio com mais ou menos intensidade
8244665 eles melhoraram significativamente a concentra o e a conviv ncia social com eles tornou se mais tranq ila
8244666 relaxamento e pensamento positivo s o efeitos colaterais da medita o n o sua meta
8244667 o grande alvo atingir a hiperconsci ncia o samadhi aquele estado de plenitude ilumina o e xtase indescrit vel
8244668 s quem tem pouco bom senso levaria hoje a s rio a maioria das id ias de freud
8244669 n o h nenhuma prova de que os seus resultados sejam eficazes
8244670 a psican lise se tornou uma esp cie de religi o
8244671 ningu m tem d vidas de que muitas das novas drogas podem aliviar os sintomas de diversas doen as da mente
8244672 mas elas n o podem curar ningu m a t cnica do tratamento pela fala cria o de freud e permanecer essencial
8244673 n o se trata de uma cr tica a freud trata se de reconhecer que os modelos da psican lise n o se encaixam com o que sabemos hoje sobre o funcionamento do c rebro
8244674 sabe se hoje que doen as como a esquizofrenia que no passado era relacionada a um trauma psicol gico t m origem org nica
8244675 para controlar os mecanismos que disparam essas alucina es a medica o fundamental
8244676 utilizar o modelo freudiano para tentar curar alguns desses dist rbios pode ser t o in til quanto tentar encontrar um erro num programa de computador quando a base do problema est na m quina
8244677 se voc tem uma tend ncia para a depress o por exemplo bvio que ela vai estar associada a algumas passagens de sua vida
8244678 mas a predisposi o j estava l enquanto outras pessoas com experi ncias semelhantes reagem de outra forma apenas por n o terem a mesma tend ncia
8244679 trabalhar com a mem ria nesses casos pode despertar sensa es terr veis que agravam o estado do paciente
8244680 claro que fundamental fazer algum tratamento psicol gico mas outras terapias n o freudianas podem ser mais indicadas
8244681 a psican lise est cheia de met foras que podem at ser teis para descrever algumas condi es humanas
8244682 a psican lise funciona sim mas n o pela validade de suas teorias e sim pelo efeito placebo que a fala tem no tratamento de dist rbios da mente
8244683 n o se trata de negar o bvio benef cio que ouvir o paciente pode trazer
8244684 trata se de reconhecer que n o h nenhuma base cient fica que sustente a psican lise
8244685 se voc sonhasse com alguns objetos f licos isso poderia significar desejos sexuais impl citos o que era t pico da sociedade em que ele viveu
8244686 hoje se um sujeito passa muito tempo sem um contato sexual ele n o sonha com objetos que lembram rg os sexuais ele sonha com sexo expl cito
8244687 claro que se voc procurar pode encontrar no seu sonho padr es e significados para o que quiser
8244688 da mesma forma que voc pode dar in meros significados a um quadro abstrato numa exposi o de arte moderna
8244689 est claro que ela j est morrendo em pa ses como a alemanha a su a e os estados unidos
8244690 talvez ela tenha uma sobrevida maior na fran a it lia e argentina mas basta observar o decrescente n mero de psiquiatras que estudam para ser psicanalistas para constatar sua decad ncia
8244691 h todo um sistema corrompido e arbitr rio j que n o existem pr requisitos s lidos para algu m ser considerado um psicanalista
8244692 n o toa que nas principais universidades americanas as id ias de freud est o saindo dos departamentos de medicina e psicologia e sobrevivem apenas nos cursos de literatura
8244693 o problema central da psican lise n o est em freud
8244694 est num imenso n mero de psicanalistas que se fecharam ao mundo exterior apegando se a teorias como se fossem dogmas religiosos
8244695 n o adianta ficar procurando a origem do sofrimento ps quico apenas no inconsciente como faz a psican lise ou numa origem org nica como fazem os neurocientistas
8244696 h outros fatores no mundo real como viver numa cidade violenta ou o medo de perder o emprego que podem por exemplo levar algu m depress o
8244697 ela um produto de uma poca e como tal muda de tempo em tempo e pode at mesmo variar de cultura para cultura
8244698 no lugar de classificar o paciente dentro de um quadro de doen a ps quica preciso analisar as for as que est o atuando para produzir esse sofrimento
8244699 in til querer curar algu m apenas com medicamentos ou tentando solucionar conflitos interiores
8244700 preciso entender o conjunto de outras for as pol ticas que agem na mente dessa pessoa
8244701 ele sentou e me contou sua hist ria de vida
8244702 quando me disse que queria largar sua mulher 15 anos mais velha que ele e que seu relacionamento com ela era t pico de m e e filho percebi qual a verdadeira origem de sua dor de est mago
8244703 me submeti a cinco anos de an lise fiz o curso na sociedade brasileira de psican lise mas cheguei conclus o de que o modelo freudiano era insuficiente como resposta s minhas inquieta es
8244704 a psican lise cuida apenas de uma dimens o do ser humano mas h outras dimens es que precisam ser levadas em considera o
8244705 ningu m tem d vida de que a vis o de freud sobre o funcionamento da mente e o desenvolvimento da personalidade tiveram conseq ncias extraordin rias
8244706 apesar de freud ter se interessado pela religi o e pela espiritualidade durante toda a sua vida ele chegou a considerar a religi o uma neurose da humanidade
8244707 isso fez com que experi ncias dessa natureza passassem a ser enquadradas at mesmo como sintomas de uma psicose
8244708 de william james a freud a psicologia ocidental tem pouco mais de 200 anos
8244709 j a psicologia oriental estuda esses estados mentais h cerca de 7000 anos
8244710 em vez de al vio ficar falando de suas ang stias despende ainda mais energia do corpo
8244711 a medita o pode trazer resultados melhores que o tratamento verbal
8244712 n o se trata de fugir dos nossos conflitos internos
8244713 trata se de fortalecer a mente para que voc responda a esses conflitos com compaix o at mesmo porque a origem deles n o est necessariamente restrita a passagens da inf ncia
8244714 a semelhan a que as duas filosofias acreditam que h algo como o inconsciente que registra eventos do passado e moldam nosso comportamento
8244715 a diferen a que segundo o budismo esses registros podem ter origem em vidas passadas
8244716 esse ataque extremamente simplista freud deixou clara sua avers o ao analista com respostas prontas para tudo s um irrespons vel se comportaria dessa forma
8244717 esse um dos motivos pelos quais algumas pessoas terminam descrentes quanto psican lise
8244718 mas um absurdo p r em d vida a validade dos conceitos de freud pela atua o de maus profissionais at porque isso pode ocorrer em qualquer profiss o
8244719 o futuro poder nos ensinar a exercer uma influ ncia direta na mente por meio de subst ncias qu micas
8244720 assim como alguns psicanalistas podem ter uma devo o quase religiosa aos modelos de freud h um discurso n o menos religioso de que os novos medicamentos podem resolver tudo sozinho
8244721 essa quest o de que existe uma oposi o entre a neuroci ncia e a psican lise est mal colocada
8244722 n o h nenhuma incompatibilidade entre as duas ao contr rio drogas como os antidepressivos podem ajudar a criar melhores condi es para que o paciente possa ser analisado
8244723 j existem pessoas nesse momento que est o tentando formular uma nova teoria da mente que possa congregar o trabalho dos neurologistas com o dos psicanalistas
8244724 o problema que falta um grande inovador como freud para unir a produ o dessas diferentes reas
8244725 se os modelos da psican lise s o deficientes a neurologia tamb m estaria longe muito longe de desvendar o maior mist rio da ci ncia a mente humana
8244726 apesar da sua import ncia na vida das pessoas a religi o sempre foi tratada com indiferen a ou apatia pela maioria dos psic logos e neurocientistas
8244727 todos os meus receios inclusive o medo da morte desapareceram eu havia alcan ado a compreens o da natureza ltima das coisas
8244728 o sentimento de unicidade parece paralisar os receptores sens rios da regi o parietal
8244729 as experi ncias m sticas t m rela o direta com o efeito placebo que pode ser gerado por condicionamento ou por expectativa o fato de se acreditar que alguma coisa vai acontecer acaba gerando conseq ncias sobre as rea es fisiol gicas
8244730 nem que est o errados os que acreditam na exist ncia de algum tipo de intera o do c rebro com algo divino
8244731 a quest o central determinar se a atividade neurol gica associada experi ncia espiritual significa que o c rebro a causa dessa experi ncia ou se em vez isso est percebendo uma realidade al m do corpo
8244732 as pessoas que praticam o transe formam uma grande reserva de autocontrole muitas s o capazes de enfrentar situa es de adversidade extrema sem se estressarem
8244733 o poder dos mitos est no fato de que seus s mbolos e temas nos conectam parte mais essencial de n s mesmos de um modo que a l gica e a raz o sozinhas n o conseguem fazer
8244734 se eu parar de plantar alface n o consigo mais escrever
8244735 o sorriso deve ser uma pr tica especialmente nos momentos dif ceis
8244736 quando aprendermos a entrar em contato com a paz estaremos curados n o uma quest o de f uma quest o de pr tica
8244737 o futuro composto de uma nica subst ncia chamada presente
8244738 existe uma montanha dentro de voc voc mais s lido e alegre do que pensa
8244739 saiba como se tornar zen basta comprar o passe anual de transporte p blico e seu estresse acaba
8244740 rvores secas sem alma nem alegria destinadas a destruir todos os tipos de desejo
8244741 o melhor do budismo o zen quando as pessoas querem sair naturalmente do seu inferno ntimo infernal affaire como diz freud
8244742 a interpreta o anal tica como o zen n o se destina a ser compreendida mas como diz lacan a criar ondas
8244743 nessa poca as pessoas discutiam sobre espiritualidade com o mesmo entusiasmo com que hoje se discute futebol
8244744 a imagem que temos de sidarta gautama pelas antigas escrituras a de um jovem s voltas com problemas existenciais angustiado por quest es ligadas ao mist rio da vida
8244745 quando eu pensava estar tocando a pele do meu abdomem era a minha coluna que eu segurava
8244746 n o deveis aceitar nada por ouvir falar tampouco porque est nas escrituras
8244747 a imperman ncia paira sobre sua cabe a nas rela es no emprego na sua sa de no seu endere o no seu celular na sua apar ncia nas suas aptid es no afeto essa a vida a que todos est o submetidos no budismo o objetivo ultrapassar essas limita es n o estamos dizendo que buscamos dist ncia dessa experi ncia limitada mas nosso objetivo libertarmo nos dos processos sutis que a criam para ajudar os outros seres a fazer o mesmo e superar as frustra es inevit veis do processo
8244748 houve uma gera o que quebrou todos os seus valores e hoje mergulha na busca espiritual
8244749 como as t cnicas funcionam independentemente da religi o de quem as pratica tem despertado o interesse tamb m de judeus crist os e mu ulmanos
8244750 o nirvana nos ensina que j somos aquilo que queremos nos tornar
8244751 a ilumina o em benef cio de todos os seres
8244752 que som produzido quando se bate palmas com uma m o s
8244753 para cada uma delas a medita o sugere um ant doto como generosidade para anular a avareza ou paci ncia para enfrentar a raiva

8244756 harrys place may be removed or rather have its dns disabled after a complaint to the company that the domain name is registered with it is
8244757 we assume after threats were made on the weekend that this complaint originates from jenna delich or her supporters
8244758 though we have not yet seen the complaint submitted we assume it runs along the lines that pointing out that ms delich linked to the website of a known neo nazi figure and former ku klux klan leader is defamatory

8244771 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8244772 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8244773 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8244774 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures
8244775 so if you select a port in one program and in another progr
8244776 clearly areva has learnt nothing from the ongoing problems at olkiluoto
8244777 france would be better served with investments in safe clean renewable energy and energy efficiency as described in the greenpeace energy r evolution scenario
8244778 in todays highly connected world intel takes mobile device security very seriously
8244779 intels low power technologies in combination with mcafees experience in security solutions should enable a more robust and secure solution for our customers
8244780 this pointless import only serves to increase criticism of japan
8244781 the whale meat should be returned to its senders at their own expense
8244782 whales as living organisms at the top of the marine ecosystem are extremely important for protecting the ocean environment and we should therefore pay close attention to how they are treated
8244783 the fisheries agency also needs to strive in future to protect the marine ecosystem by revising its own lethal research programme which has led to the deaths of almost 8 700 whales in whale sanctuaries across the southern oceans and move on to non lethal means of conducting research on whales
8244784 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking

8244789 estos son explosivos de alta peligrosidad utilizados exclusivamente para cometer actos terroristas nuestros t cnicos consideraron que era necesario eliminarlos lo m s pronto posible y dadas las caracter sticas geogr ficas del lugar estimaron que pod an hacerlo sin poner en riesgo su vida ni la de los dem s pero los efectos devastadores trascendieron los c lculos que hab an establecido los mismos t cnicos
8244790 eso es cierto no vamos a ser indiferentes ni insolidarios pero quiero reiterar el xito de la neutralizaci n de la amenaza terrorista que representaban los explosivos encontrados
8244791 the alliance will continue to protest until our demands are met this government has to resign
8244792 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8244793 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8244794 with so many modes of communication available these days its difficult to keep track of your partners whereabouts or who theyre chatting to and when and what it all means no wonder so many of us are checking our partners texts but theres reason to take note as virgin mobiles research proves that thousands of relationships are breaking down as a result of our text checking behaviour
8244795 virgin mobile couldnt believe the results of this research in fact we were amazed so many of us are so snoopy in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us to stop the average text checker in their tracks and hopefully make them think twice about what they are doing weve launched the new text checker service

8244801 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy

8244804 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8244805 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8244806 an underlying shift is occurring in american attitudes regarding the international role and priorities of the united states voters across the party spectrum understand that americas reputation has faltered and believe this is a problem for the nation that needs attention and repair
8244807 both dependence on foreign oil and strengthening the global economy have skyrocketed displacing terrorism at the top of voters international concerns
8244808 to advance these and other issues our research shows that americans overwhelmingly support policies that promote a balance of military strength and diplomacy and to prioritize international cooperation instead of going it alone to advance our interests
8244809 why remember why return to times that were so painful when i can think about happy thoughts and not feel bad
8244810 some of the 34 filipinos are on a scheduled visit to the philippines they might also wait it out in manila for the meantime until the situation in georgia goes back to normal

8244812 we have to wait things out first conditions have improved anyway
8244813 the roe v wade decision legalizing abortion is actually a nazi type law it is completely in the spirit of the nazis that is it contains the elements of moral relativity and contempt for human life that characterized the hitler regime

8244816 my visit to cameroon is to find out what measures have been taken to comply with the new chemical regulations governing chemical residue in cocoa
8244817 my main reason for being here is to ensure that they cameroon authorities and cocoa farmers are fully aware and ready for this new e u regulation that goes into effect next monday
8244818 to be more sensitized on the importance of this issue
8244819 we at copal are very concerned by this e u decision and its immediate application in september even though we dont use these products anymore they may still show up in future cocoa coming from these countries
8244820 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change

8245018 the artists who are my heroes be it marvin prince or donny were never too proud to reveal there true selves it is impossible to be a true artists if your art isnt honest although it might hurt sometimes i have no problem baring the realness of my life in the songs
8245019 i spend a lot of time overseas and those sounds are as much a part of my influence as soul or gospel i want to experiment and mix a little of that flavor with what i do best
8245020 bryan and i have worked together a few times in the past and obviously his track record speaks for itself
8245021 although im from the west coast i try to make music that will have a universal appeal
8245022 its always been my desire to make music for the world
8245023 ive always been just a producer at heart but my friends and family kept insisting that i do another project
8245024 not trying to sound arrogant but as a fan of rap i just wasnt hearing much music that i thought was moving the world
8245025 but this song was the next to last song that i recorded i needed the perfect song to represent dr dre 2001
8245026 anyone who has ever lost a loved one will be able to relate
8245027 and marys singing just sends the song over the top
8245028 naja wenn ein schwarzer sich erdreistet pr sident werden zu wollen dann muss man frau eben auch mit anschl gen rechnen
8245029 naja wenn ein schwarzer sich erdreistet pr sident werden zu wollen dann muss man frau eben auch mit anschl gen rechnen
8245030 we couldnt believe that she was such a great singer and so young and beautiful and hadnt been discovered yet
8245031 i was in the studio with evan and carl and our engineer al hemberger came up with it while we were playing a word game with my name we all jumped on it and thought it was fitting the definition of intelligence is the gathering of new knowledge or information the ability to comprehend and profit from experience i hunger for that knowledge it feeds my life and my music the more i learn the more i want to learn the more i grow as a person and as an artist
8245032 i think ive known all along that it was my destiny to perform on stage and give something to people with my music
8245033 i love music its my passion and i cant wait for people to hear what i have to say and ive got a lot to say
8245034 i did track and field lawn tennis and represented my school and barbados at swimming
8245035 we were both active in the cadets and i was her drill sergeant there was one occasion when i had to make her drop and give me ten push ups we laugh about it now i think shes forgiven me
8245036 she used to encourage me even as young as 3 and 4 all my family were musical all my cousins play the piano they used to come over to my house and we would play at the piano for hours
8245037 we couldnt believe that she was such a great singer and so young and beautiful and hadnt been discovered yet
8245038 i jumped out of bed in the middle of the night with this beat in my head i started writing straight away i was thinking about society about poverty and the underprivileged the songs about struggle holding on to your dignity and says that having faith in yourself gives you hope i think the line in the song keep yours eyes on tomorrow but live for today kinda sums it up
8245039 i think ive known all along that it was my destiny to perform on stage and give something to people with my music
8245040 i love music its my passion and i just cant wait for people to hear what i have to say and ive got a lot to say
8245041 when retailers started planning for back to school and back to college they were more than likely conservative in their inventory levels

8245049 barbara 26 often talked about phelps 23 with her friends even before the beijing olympic games
8245050 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8245051 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports
8245052 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident sein
8245053 we would like to feature you in one of our vegetarian ads our campaigns are known for featuring attention getting images and the muscularity you displayed in winning your victory would certainly attract attention and make it clear that a vegetarian diet can lead to a body built for olympian feats
8245054 your well honed physique could also help young and not so young men understand that when it is time for a real workout they should avoid meat if they want to achieve maximum performance
8245055 we havent received any response yet but people mostly agree to be a part of our campaigns and i am sure sushil will do the same
8245056 there will be a lot of body showing and that is primarily because we want to send across a message that one can have his kind of muscles even with vegetarian food
8245057 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8245058 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8245059 indians are now the number one immigrants into the state of victoria and indian overseas students are the second largest cohort of international students in the state we are encouraging students and immigrants to play afl as it will help them integrate with the community by getting involved and connected with this very australian cultural activity
8245060 presently the afl and austrade australian trade commission are partnering to deliver exhibition games in india in late january early february 2009 we are planning to have the game played between two afl clubs before a crowd of approximately 10 000 people and to be televised both in australia and in india
8245061 the international cup is an excellent platform to build sport and business links with india minister for trade simon crean said while welcoming the international teams to australia i would like to congratulate the afl for this initiative the government will continue to work with them to assist in promoting our great game overseas

8245077 hes starting to get a bit paranoid at the moment but i dont think people will hold that against him

8245079 mikey has become such a character it seems like he has come out of his shell

8245081 we are extremely encouraged by the results of the aza 001 trial which for the first time showed that survival could be extended for patients with higher risk mds
8245082 roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with mds will progress to acute myeloid leukemia aml but treatment with vidaza significantly delays this progression vidaza not only has great survival data in mds but can also prevent progression to aml

8245086 its a completely different way of present ing the content that gives the reader a new e mail experience

8245089 as most people know usually by personal experience modern u s health care is hugely expensive and does not always assure safety
8245090 what were doing is exploring virtual worlds and ubiquitous computing that is the not so utopian and imminent world in which everything including objects is alive by virtue of being connected to a network as a model for efficient operations the ultimate goal is to move beyond modeling so that these systems may actually be used as tools in real hospitals real pharmacies and clinics and other care facilities
8245091 in the everything is alive vision objects talk to each other
8245092 our virtual objects do this and increasingly so can wirelessly connected real world objects so its time to generate a rich collection of vignettes or workflows that exercise this capability to understand it better for example well work on a situation in which a blood pressure machine interacts intelligently with an iv drip so that the latter can adjust appropriately based on information received from the former all of this can happen without fallible humans manually controlling both machines
8245093 some argue that my students and i are just having fun that we could model all of these things in older technologies such as queuing theory
8245094 my response is yes we are having fun and were beginning to see how virtual worlds excel in providing users with understandable simulations of business practices if the real world is moving toward identity management technologies like rfid to keep track of things we can get there first in a virtual world analyze business situations and then optimize to make them safer and less expensive
8245095 worldwide avian flu control efforts have been mostly successful but like seasonal influenza avian flu changes year to year creating new subtypes and strains that could easily and quickly spread among humans
8245096 vlps may be advantageous over other vaccine strategies because they are easy to develop produce and manufacture
8245097 using recombinant technologies within ten weeks we could generate a vaccine most effective towards the current circulating strain of virus making it a cost effective counter measure to the threat of an avian influenza pandemic
8245098 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
8245099 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
8245100 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
8245101 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
8245102 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
8245103 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
8245104 the debate on when and how to treat early parkinsons disease patients has been ongoing currently treatment would typically be initiated when symptoms have caused disability however providing the medical evidence for a treatment to retard or prevent the progression of pd is a major therapeutic priority and the proud study aims to shed more light into this question pramipexole was considered an optimal candidate for this study due to evidence suggesting possible benefits to pd patients beyond treating the well known core symptoms based on the unique technique used in this study proud may provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of early pd treatment which would offer hope to the ever increasing number of patients diagnosed with parkinsons disease
8245105 previously the prodest study identified that pd related depressive symptoms are common with nearly half of those pd patients receiving anti depressants continuing to experience depressive symptoms these symptoms impact significantly on quality of life both for pd patients and their carers the new european study aims to provide answers on the role pramipexole may play in managing these commonly experienced pd related depressive symptoms that are often under recognised and consequently under treated
8245106 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
8245107 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
8245108 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
8245109 you would have to be deaf dumb and blind not to have the feeling of party unity after the speech hillary clinton gave

8245116 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8245117 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8245118 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8245119 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8245120 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8245121 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8245122 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8245123 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and tsvangirai form a transitional government

8245149 adagio este un studiu important constituind o provocare pentru managementul actual al bolii parkinson initierea timpurie a monoterapiei cu rasagilina ofera beneficii fata de un debut intarziat al tratamentului mai mult decat atat rezultatele studiului intaresc conceptul conform caruia pacientii cu boala parkinson trebuie sa primeasca tratament medicamentos cat mai curand posibil dupa stabilirea diagnosticului in vederea ameliorarii rezultatelor ulterioare
8245150 incetinirea progresiei bolii constituia cea mai mare nevoie neacoperita inca in tratamentul bolii parkinson
8245151 de la inceput design ul studiului adagio a incercat sa separe efectele simptomatice ale tratamentului cu rasagilina de efectele de modificare a evolutiei bolii
8245152 boala parkinson este mai mult decat o boala care afecteaza comportamentul motor pacientii fiind afectati pe langa conditia propriu zisa si de impactul major al bolii in domeniile esentiale ale vietii familie si prieteni munca si venituri relaxare ceea ce duce la reducerea considerabila a independetei si calitatii vietii studiul adagio cu rasagilina aduce noi sperante oamenilor si familiilor celor cu boala parkinson in sensul pastrarii mai indelungate a independentei si calitatii vietii
8245153 i am not disappointed at all with the path and the progress that these two young players have made
8245154 it takes time so if its not up to somebody elses standards i cant control that i am very happy with what i see
8245155 theyll continue to get better and thats the most important thing they need reps they need to play in games and thats why well try to get them as many opportunities as we possibly can this thursday against tennessee
8245156 i feel like ive had some pretty good days in practice some days where i felt like everything went well and everything came together and i felt really good about it
8245157 obviously the preseason games havent gone like i want them to and hopefully we can finish it off this week with a good one
8245158 its going to be tough because theyre obviously good theyve got some great players its going to be a big challenge for us but were going to have to go out there and its just going to make us execute that much better and be on point because if were not we may not have that much success
8245159 i want to get out there and prove to myself that im going to be able to play in this league
8245160 im just looking forward to it its going to be a lot of fun im going to try to take what ive done in camp so far practice and everything and translate that to the game field
8245161 i say matt hes more comfortable more laid back kind of nonchalant about everything brians the same way off the field but once he gets on the field hes kind of like he presses a little bit youve just got to let the game come to you and do what youve been doing to get to this point i think that if they do that theyll be fine
8245162 i think this game is going to give them a lot of opportunities to showcase what they have
8245163 were looking forward to it were excited for both of them because we know they both have a bright upside
8245164 thats why they formed this team because its not based off of one player so were extremely confident in whoevers out there on the field
8245165 the teams access to ufo evidence is unparalleled and their expertise allows them to quickly identify bogus claims of ufos
8245166 we are looking at an australian ufo episode for the next season thats for sure
8245167 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8245168 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8245169 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8245170 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8245171 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8245172 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8245173 in the case of birds lots of extinctions no change in total biodiversity
8245174 i have used original kashmiri music in the film which has been recorded in kashmir i have used a lot of instruments like santoor rebab and tumbaknari and many kashmiri folk artists have also sung in the film i have tried improving this music without distorting the original essence and i hope that you will enjoy it
8245175 i feel that the background score composed by taufique in the film is fabulous it is very kashmiri and soothing to hear and you dont feel that an orchestra comprising 50 musicians is used to compose the music of the film tahaan it is very nice
8245176 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8245177 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports
8245178 the demand is not very good as people were expecting a price correction

8245182 my husband and i went to bed when we were woken at about 2 o clock in the morning by these boys
8245183 the chip pan was on fire so my husband put it out with an extinguisher weve had for about 30 years
8245184 i cant admire them enough i think theyre heroes and if it wasnt for them i dont think my husband and i would have survived
8245185 when we got to the house we thought wed better knock to see if anything was happening but we couldnt get a response so started throwing stones at windows and banging on the door
8245186 sometimes peoples perception of a group of lads is that theyre up to no good but they responded to the smoke alarm going off called the fire brigade and woke the couple up
8245187 you dont have to be a magician to create change get out and vote
8245188 we want to win the super cup it is as simple as that
8245189 at the end of it to be known as the best club in europe is what we want and we will be doing our best to get it
8245190 it is the winners of the uefa cup against the winners of the european cup so it is a special game
8245191 the last time we played in the super cup we lost and it is was not very nice winning it gives you confidence
8245192 i believe this team can dominate football for the next five or ten years
8245193 last season was unbelievable and the test now is to build on that starting with the super cup i want that on my cv

8245228 its like jennifer is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past jennifer shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8245229 since john said it was he who broke off their four month romance jennifer has kept a stiff upper lip and let her actions do the talking making sure everyone sees her smiling and looking sexy
8245230 jennifer was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend

8245233 i made clear that i would have expected that one would discuss the issue in the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce or in the un security council before unilateral recognition
8245234 the german government welcomes this courageous election in the lower house as showing the spirit of change revealed in parliamentary and presidential elections this year is continuing
8245235 the vast majority of uk homes will be able to carry out improvements under existing permitted development rights but most people are unaware of this
8245236 what they intend bringing in is actually permitted development rights which the vast majority of british homeowners already have
8245237 our survey found that the most common reason people have for moving is still the desire for more space which means that despite the current slowdown in the housing market people still need to move home
8245238 we couldnt move far because tom had just started secondary school but there were a few four and five bedroom houses within our price range
8245239 i went to view this house without kerry and thought hed hate it because it was stuck in an eighties time warp but he instantly saw the potential to extend
8245240 i immediately started sketching out ideas for a new layout which would involve extending sideways and to the rear i knew exactly how we could change the house to give us all the space we needed
8245241 at first i thought we could all carry on living here and even bought camping equipment to use when the work started
8245242 clearly i was crazy because it was obvious that it would be impossible for us to stay in a house with no mains water and all the dirt and disruption as well as being totally unsafe for the children we ended up moving out and renting a local flat for the duration
8245243 we started the magazine after discovering a strong market for people who prefer to stay in their house and tackle projects which give them the extra space they need rather than sell up and start again many people are tied to an area either because they love it or for schools
8245244 when considering a conversion its important to calculate whether it will actually add value for example a basement conversion costs on average 300 per square foot so in order for it to add value and compensate for the disruption you need to be able to achieve approximately 500 per square foot when you eventually come to sell it
8245245 although extending your home can undoubtedly add value the scale of the project must be in keeping with the original size and style of the property there is no point adding five additional bedrooms if the sitting room and kitchen are tiny similarly consider the size of the plot a big family home needs a garden large enough for children to play in
8245246 i bought it when it was actually a squat but i knew the importance of the location now that i am selling it 24 years on i have focused on exactly who is likely to buy it and have improved it accordingly
8245247 its perfect for a man who works from 8am until 8pm who needs a pied terre is not looking for a nest and who wants a sophisticated modern area the end result is a place with more machismo than before its like a perfect suite in a hotel
8245248 it had been converted in 1996 from its previous existence as a club for farmers it was made to look rather faux victorian and by the time we moved in it looked pretty tired with smoky ceilings and decoration almost a decade old
8245249 the high ceilings shutters and ornate cornices meant the bedrooms and drawing room had to be decorated but would remain in their traditional style with ornate cornices picture rails and so on however the ki tchen area was a modern extension and although it needed complete renovation too we could use more imagination
8245250 i love the feeling of mixing modern appearance with the classic look in the rest of the apartment which weve taken back to how it was 160 years ago modernity works with period and character
8245251 over four million new uk households are expected to be created within the next five or six years
8245252 even for a buoyant new build housing industry this is an impossible demand to meet and places renewed emphasis on the importance of bringing into use millions of good properties which are facing dereliction
8245253 to convert them into habitable energy efficient and economical homes to run accommodation for sale or rent
8245254 barack obama est mon candidat et il doit tre notre pr sident

8245256 some homeowners are finding it very difficult to accept they wont get what they might have sold at last year and are turning to renting out their place for six to 12 months to see what happens
8245257 never go ahead and spend money buying furniture for tenants but if someone walks through the door and wants to rent the place if you furnish it be prepared for that trip to ikea
8245258 if you only plan to rent out your place temporaily then your lender might not demand you convert to a buy to let mortgage but if it is more permanent you will if you let the property and dont tell them youll be in breach of the terms of your mortgage
8245259 landlords new to the game must recognise their legal responsibilities for example all gas appliances must be properly maintained and an annual safety check should be carried out by a corgi approved contractor
8245260 but then we realised its in a very sought after area and when we spoke to local estate agents they said they would have no trouble finding tenants
8245261 its a great way of seeing how they would treat your home when we met our tenants in their previous house it was clear in less than a minute they would look after our place
8245262 i looked into selling but the valuations werent of interest to me
8245263 im going to wait and see what happens i think these things are cyclical and in a couple of years prices will come round again
8245264 50 things to do at 50 contest more about the winner after he she is notified the responses were fantastic and i want to share them with you in no particular order
8245265 free health care is a basic right that should be provided by the state to all citizens
8245266 there is simply not enough money in the state budget to provide free health care
8245267 ive never had a problem saying that we can see biological effects in these low dose studies
8245268 but why are we seeing these studies that cant be repeated
8245269 bpa exhibits toxic ef fects only at very high levels of exposure
8245270 then higher doses are worse and an even higher dose is even worse
8245271 why do we have to work so hard to try to replicate and show these low doses really have an effect
8245272 why dont reactions to bpa stand out in black and white
8245273 theres a lot of complexity and a lot of things we just dont understand
8245274 now what we have to do is raise awareness and start looking at these products differently and ask questions about whether they should be making their way into our everyday environment
8245275 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with the industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
8245276 the gold market has changed remarkably over the last four weeks the pickup in physical demand has been a characteristic across not just india but also europe the middle east asia and the united states volumes are returning to levels that were more reflective of conditions back in 2006 indeed gold krugerrand coins are also in limited supply with many retailers reporting a depletion in stocks where supplies are not exhausted significant delivery delays exist
8245277 you can stop animal movements try to enforce bio security on farms and try and make sure people disinfect themselves
8245278 all we can do is try to detect and contain such transmissions afterwards
8245279 currently we know where the owner of the animals lives but that is slightly different from knowing where the animal is if that information was available you could make some useful and powerful predictions in terms of risk
8245280 the level of information that i would like the uk to aspire to has already been achieved by other countries including new zealand
8245281 the next day we would be able to say these are the farms that we feel are the priority for inspection
8245282 there has to be a reasonable balance struck between the need to protect public health on the one hand while allowing for traditional practices that pose no threat to any member of the public on the other
8245283 already farmers markets and small food producers are under threat by over zealous regulation and this new directive now threatens to undermine fairs and agricultural shows
8245284 provision needs to be made to support artisan food producers who provide quality local produce at good prices that provide employment and help market rural areas entrepreneurship in the agri sector and agrifood and agritourism are essential to maintaining progress in rural ireland
8245285 were struggling to raise our game having achieved our objective of winning the test series
8245286 have you forgotten your comments about how deserved england were in celebrating the ashes win even if it was to the detriment of the odi games that tour and lest we forget the zealousness of those celebrations
8245287 although it is not just the similarity of the two sports that brought this about cycling and cricket have always been associated at the grass roots level and many players of my small club cycle to home matches the connections at the top level have become blurred
8245288 there were some airports that were affected more than others
8245289 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8245290 so what we had to do was dump all of the flight plan information that was in the system and then manually enter the people who were waiting to take off
8245291 thats what created the ripple effect throughout the system and created the delays that we had
8245292 die deutschen politiker d rfen nicht l nger an der stationierung der atombomben in deutschland festhalten die sprengk pfe m ssen endlich abgezogen und vernichtet werden dies w re ein wichtiges signal auch an russland das die aufnahme neuer abr stungsgespr che vom vollst ndigen abzug aller taktischen atomwaffen der usa aus europa abh ngig gemacht hat

8245295 automotive oems produce vehicles on global platforms as material producers we must therefore have capacity to supply high quality high performance pp cp and provide best in class service to customers globally
8245296 we believe that the agreements with borealis will further improve our ability to fulfil our customers demands for polypropylene and will consolidate our position as a global supplier in the european automotive sector
8245297 we need to know about things such as erosion about natural resources and which areas are suitable for agriculture gis enables us to do so as it combines all relevant and necessary information in one visual system
8245298 geographic information technology systems when incorporating features such as climatologic information water sources infrastructure and soil structure could show us which regions in africa as a whole or in individual african countries are suitable for what kind of agriculture
8245299 these systems are also capable of showing what natural resources exist in a specific region is there fresh water for instance and what is the land coverage and soil structure
8245300 also are there markets where farmers can sell their produce and what is the infrastructure like there may be markets but if there are no roads that lead to them you will be unable to sell your products
8245301 the pesticides that are washing down the lake as a result of farming combined with the wild growth of the alien invasive water hyacinth are disastrous for the fish stocks and fisheries this situation could be more efficiently monitored with a gis
8245302 it was green because of algae today the potomac is healthy and blue again the gis gave the authorities the tools to monitor the situation and to develop a strategy to deal with the problem
8245303 if you know where people live it is easier to decide where to build a school or a clinic a geographical information system may also assist authorities in mapping malaria hot spots in relation to where people live this information is a key to developing anti malaria drives
8245304 much of the information is incomplete or out of date only a small number of countries like south africa have the means to collect data in an efficient manner
8245305 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8245306 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio and i cry and im just like everybody else you know i have all the same feelings that everyone else has

8245312 by exploring and developing an insight into the tropical forest at amazonia the pupils depth of knowledge and attitude towards the animal world is greatly enhanced
8245313 in our present climate we have to ensure that we are educating children as well as adults as much as possible
8245314 we want to ensure that they understand how much danger animals all over the world are in due to their rainforest habitats being destroyed
8245315 how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity it is like precious oil poured on the head running down on the beard running down on aarons beard down upon the collar of his robes it is as if the dew of hermon were falling on mount zion for there the lord bestows his blessing even life forevermore
8245316 what is given can be taken away everyone lies everyone dies
8245317 but then she called me back saying that her mom pretty much has told her that no she needs to keep the baby and that shes not giving it up for adoption even though she really did not want to have the baby
8245318 i have spent every day since monday june 9 2008 looking for my daughter
8245319 i have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever i could by any means to find my daughter i avoided calling the police or even notifying my family out of fear i have been and still am afraid of what has or may happen to caylee
8245320 if i really wanted to just get rid of her i wouldve left her with my parents and i wouldve left
8245321 i wouldve moved out i wouldve given my mom custody
8245322 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look

8245326 we are very excited to bring this landmark kansas city event to kctv5 and myksmo tv being involved in the community and celebrating the holiday season with our friends and family will take on new meaning for our team this year we look forward to expanding and enhancing an already great local event
8245327 why mommy i thought you said i could stay in the car

8245330 right but thats not going to happen because i would never leave you in the car its not safe
8245331 but mommy the police will come get you and youll go to jail and i wont see you for a long long time
8245332 we were delighted with the community turnout at last years seminars there is a great deal of interest in the community in sustainability and how to address the practical challenges to implementing green alternatives
8245333 we expect that this years speakers will be as successful in addressing these interests
8245334 we used to have this thing about stress being bad but what we call eustress literally meaning good stress has positive benefits it comes from doing things like exercise sex or meeting a challenge physically it improves your respiration lowers blood pressure and heart rate and your levels of endorphins hormones which make you feel good are raised
8245335 it can be really beneficial as a way of getting out of that black hole
8245336 a great investment for the company something were incredibly proud of a signature event for the company and it is profitable
8245337 hopefully this has provided a platform for us to promote our new shows historically there hasnt been a huge correlation between using that platform and what happens in the fall
8245338 but hopefully its better than not having it and hopefully we can enjoy that success on the entertainment side as well
8245339 news on byetta suggests potential risk with the development of other glp 1 programs including those by novo nordisk

8245345 we know about this case of the eight year old girl and mother who are in trouble and our consulate in the algarve is assisting them
8245346 there was no reason for her to fall it was a beautiful sunny day it was dry underfoot and ideal for a walk
8245347 there was nothing to explain it we considered everything could someone have pushed her but that would have been impossible
8245348 we even considered if they had been attacked by a bear or a wolf but there was no trace of human or animal attack on the body how she fell is a mystery
8245349 this is terrible we have been operating since 1991 and weve never had a tourist die
8245350 the occupants of the house have not been accounted for and we are appealing for mr foster mrs foster and kirsty to get in touch if they are out there

8245352 failure to keep to the speed limit has led to four deaths and 13 injured on the motorways of the calais region since the start of this year
8245353 half of the speeding offences detected at more than 200kph in this area have been committed by british drivers
8245354 the british sometimes refuse to pull over when waved down and some even try to outrun police cars and get away its like a game to them
8245355 we have several unmarked patrol cars capable of 170mph so drivers should be warned they are unlikely to be able to get away from us
8245356 we worked alongside the gendarmerie to give and receive road safety advice learn good practice help with language difficulties promote the kent police travelling abroad web page and observe french procedures

8245361 borstimplantaten zijn zo lelijk veel van mijn vrienden hebben een ingreep ondergaan die niet geslaagd is ik ken zelfs iemand waar haar borst na de ingreep ongeveer op haar schouder zat maar ik kan begrijpen als je borsten op je knie n hangen nadat je kinderen hebt dat je een ingreep ondergaat dat zou ik ook nog doen
8245362 ik heb nooit anorexia gehad maar soms dacht ik ook wel eens zo mager wil ik niet zijn ik herinner me dat ik eens opstond uit het bad en recht in een spiegel keek toen dacht ik ik ben echt veel te mager dit wil ik niet
8245363 de krapte op de arbeidsmarkt aan ingenieurs wetenschappers en technici neemt alsmaar toe meer dan de helft van de jongeren die zouden kunnen kiezen voor een wetenschappelijke studierichting of ingenieursopleiding doen dit niet
8245364 bij het kiezen van een studierichting laten jongeren zich nog te weinig leiden door hun eigen interesses en talenten
8245365 doordat kinderen er in het lager onderwijs weinig of niet mee in aanraking komen weten ze bij de studiekeuze niet of een technische richting hen zou liggen
8245366 zelfs in de kleuterklas kan je kinderen warm maken voor wetenschap door hen op een speelse en aanschouwelijke manier aan de hand van eenvoudige proeven een antwoord te geven op de vele waarom vragen die ze stellen

8245396 el perfil militante de la lcr se ha modificado sustancialmente desde el a o 2002 la franja m s importante de sus nuevos adherentes no ha hecho pol tica con anterioridad el rejuvenecimiento ha proseguido tras las elecciones presidenciales del 2007 la lcr presenta una pir mide de edad inversa en relaci n a partidos como el pcf o el ps una cuarta parte de sus militantes tiene menos de 30 a os y la mitad menos de 40 su composici n social tambi n ha cambiado la lcr atrae a capas mucho m s populares que antes con una parte muy importante de personas bajo contrato precario es la izquierda obrera una poblaci n rebelde que rechaza violentamente la sociedad en que vive su primera preocupaci n es la justicia social tiene un gran deseo de eficacia inmediata el partido debe hacerse cargo de todo e intervenir en todos los terrenos actuando a la vez como sindicato asociaci n y partido pol tico para estos militantes la izquierda son ellos detestan al partido socialista a quien acusan de no ser ya de izquierdas en cuanto al pcf y los verdes ni siquiera entran en su campo de visi n est n impacientes y quieren batallar en todos los frentes constituyen un desaf o para la lcr que debe encontrar un funcionamiento y un lenguaje adaptados a ese p blico
8245397 he aqu una intervenci n dec a maravillado un compa ero vasco que por su calado y su alcance estrat gico bien podr a haber sido el discurso central o la clausura del mitin
8245398 haremos todo cuanto est en nuestras manos para que este oto o sea caliente
8245399 es muy posible que no venzamos pero a n as lucharemos
8245400 hay que empezar a reunir las condiciones de un movimiento general si permiti semos que el gobierno llevara adelante sus reformas liberales nuestra sociedad se tornar a irreconocible la derecha quiere liquidar los cuatro pilares de nuestras conquistas el c digo del trabajo las vacaciones pagadas los servicios p blicos y la protecci n social frente a semejante agresi n qu nos propone el ps que esperemos que esperemos pacientemente a las elecciones presidenciales de 2012 y a una hipot tica y en sima alternancia de la que s lo tenemos una certeza que no cambiar a nada en nuestras vidas no es ahora cuando hay que pararle los pies a sarkozy
8245401 se espera de nosotros que acometamos un trabajo que requerir a disponer de los recursos de una potente multinacional cuando en realidad somos casi una pyme pero habr que hacerlo es nuestro deber las huelgas no paran de interpelar a la izquierda que ni siquiera hace su trabajo parlamentario quiz s porque muchas veces hay un acuerdo de fondo con las reformas privatizadoras de la derecha pues bien quienes luchan deben saber que por lo menos contar n siempre con nosotros somos la izquierda que quiere ir hasta el final y eso quiere decir en el caso de la inmigraci n hoy denostada y amenazada por el gobierno que pelearemos hasta la regularizaci n de todo el mundo que no cejaremos hasta el cierre de los centros de internamiento y hasta conquistar la igualdad de derechos eso quiere decir frente a la crisis un aumento salarial de 300 euros la prohibici n de los despidos levantar el secreto bancario eso quiere decir el reparto de las riquezas y finalmente la apropiaci n y la reorganizaci n de la econom a bajo el control democr tico de una mayor a social que debe convertirse en el sujeto de su propio destino
8245402 una europa ecol gica feminista humana con un salario m nimo para todas y todos con una harmonizaci n de las leyes positivas y las conquistas democr ticas y sociales una europa de los servicios p blicos una europa abierta
8245403 de tal modo que vayan juntas las fuerzas que representan a esa izquierda en francia en italia en portugal en el estado espa ol en inglaterra tambi n en polonia
8245404 esa nueva bastilla de los tiempos modernos que representa la comisi n de bruselas
8245405 el siglo xx ha existido con sus convulsiones gigantescas y sus revoluciones pero tambi n con sus tremendas derrotas y con el agotamiento de grandes proyectos de emancipaci n en el albor de una nueva etapa nos disponemos a emprender un apasionante viaje es hora pues de hacer inventario debemos preparar cuidadosamente nuestro equipaje
8245406 mit der zweiten veranstaltung haben wir einen wahren boom zu verzeichnen sowohl die anzahl der aussteller als auch die gebuchten ausstellungsfl chen betreffend mit diesmal 104 ausstellern betr gt die steigerung gegen ber der erstveranstaltung im jahr 2007 satte 68 noch ein bisschen mehr n mlich um stolze 73 hat die bondexpo hinsichtlich der gebuchten ausstellungsfl che zugelegt das bertrifft unsere k hnsten erwartungen und verpflichtet nat rlich auch zur konsequenten weiterentwicklung
8245407 wir werden uns im zweiten halbjahr gut schlagen und sind nicht pessimistisch
8245408 auf basis dieser struktur halten wir ausschau nach sinnvollen erg nzungen
8245409 bei laurin len zum beispiel einem wichtigen nat rlichen rohstoff f r cognis liegen die preise im ersten halbjahr auf euro basis um gut 50 ber dem niveau des vorjahres
8245410 sie versuchen teilweise auf andere quellen auszuweichen oder geringere mengen einzusetzen

8245412 zweifellos haben targeting technologien iptv und die verf gbarkeit des mobilen internets der branche einen erneuten schub gegeben zudem f llt auf dass auch immer mehr klassische branchen die online werbung f r sich entdecken
8245413 daher ist es sowohl f r branchenneulinge als auch f r etablierte online vermarkter wichtig das networking mit erfahrenen branchen experten zu pflegen erfahrungen zu teilen und impulse f r das eigene unternehmen mitzunehmen
8245414 wir m ssen wieder so zusammenarbeiten wie vor zwei jahren
8245415 das ist eine deutliche einschr nkung meiner ermittlungen aber eine best tigung meiner pflicht ersatzanspr che wegen der ver u erung von bank austria unter wert weiter geltend zu machen
8245416 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8245417 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8245418 georgian president mikhail saakashvili chose genocide to fulfill his political plans
8245419 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8245420 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8245421 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8245422 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
8245423 de krapte op de arbeidsmarkt aan ingenieurs wetenschappers en technici neemt alsmaar toe meer dan de helft van de jongeren die zouden kunnen kiezen voor een wetenschappelijke studierichting of ingenieursopleiding doen dit niet
8245424 bij het kiezen van een studierichting laten jongeren zich nog te weinig leiden door hun eigen interesses en talenten
8245425 doordat kinderen er in het lager onderwijs weinig of niet mee in aanraking komen weten ze bij de studiekeuze niet of een technische richting hen zou liggen
8245426 zelfs in de kleuterklas kan je kinderen warm maken voor wetenschap door hen op een speelse en aanschouwelijke manier aan de hand van eenvoudige proeven een antwoord te geven op de vele waarom vragen die ze stellen
8245427 i can confirm i am going to tottenham i am waiting for a visa and as soon as it is granted i am ready to go to england and sign
8245428 juande ramos and i have not yet met it seems like he will call me but i know for sure he is very interested in my services
8245429 i would prefer it if the deal was described as very close at the moment the papers have not been signed we have only reached a verbal agreement with the english club
8245430 tottenhams position has been made more difficult by the fact that no offer is currently on the table for the striker despite interest from united as well as two spanish clubs at the same time spurs complaint to the premier league regarding uniteds conduct in their pursuit of berbatov is on hold
8245431 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash

8245437 negotiations are continuing with the hijackers in order to free the remaining crew members and for the hijackers to give themselves up
8245438 they have asked for asylum rights refugee status that was their first demand
8245439 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8245440 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8245441 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8245442 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8245443 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8245444 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8245445 im going to do what hillary asks of me im going to respect her wishes
8245446 i see how great she would have been as president
8245447 but i know where we are and where we have to go im ready
8245448 she expects all clinton supporters to do whatever it takes to elect barack obama period end of discussion
8245449 colorado stand up florida stand up pennsylvania get off your hind end in the cheap seats stand up we want to hear you from denver to detroit from montana to mississippi from california to carolinas
8245450 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8245451 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8245452 ha cavado con sus propias manos una fosa de sangre entre georgia y estas dos rep blicas lo que hace imposible que convivan juntos todos en un mismo estado
8245453 en estas condiciones no hab a otra soluci n que reconocer la independencia de las dos rep blicas para proteger a la poblaci n de las dos territorios para evitar las matanzas de las ltimas semanas
8245454 no s si los ciudadanos occidentales se dan cuenta del peligro que supone shaakasvili un hombre que dice estar dispuesto a quemar el mundo para hacerse los huevos fritos
8245455 rusia sigui buscando una soluci n negociada en el marco de la integridad territorial de georgia
8245456 al principio explicaron que se trataba de unas maniobras rutinarias que no ten a nada que ver con la situaci n en el c ucaso y nos parec a leg timo pero aparecieron m s buques ahora son diez y est previsto que aumenten hasta 18
8245457 no se puede dejar de pensar que esto tiene otros objetivos como una demostraci n de fuerza o algo parecido
8245458 es una situaci n preocupante que no contribuye a la resoluci n de la crisis
8245459 las fuentes de tensi n estar n en otra parte avance de las fronteras de la otan hacia rusia construcci n del sistema antimisiles cerca de rusia establecimiento de bases militares cerca de nuestras fronteras
8245460 rusia por su parte ha cerrado bases en vietnam ha terminado con su presencia militar en cuba ha reducido sus fuerzas armadas y ha insistido a estados unidos en la necesidad de reducir el arsenal nuclear
8245461 de nuestra parte las puertas del di logo est n totalmente abiertas
8245462 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico
8245463 i mean whats a year when you take the life of a child
8245464 she can have her life back but our lives are totally destroyed
8245465 the governor is worried about 80 dogs being shot by their owner
8245466 and im wondering how many people how many children is it going to take before these laws get stricter for hit and run drivers
8245467 the problem is many pedestrians do not own vehicles so they dont have their own coverage
8245468 the best option is always to wait for police and turn yourself in
8245469 its not worth torturing somebodys family and friends who never did anything to you
8245470 the city is bigger than that and i think unisys is bigger than that
8245471 theyre still very positive about philadelphia we still have a more than great shot at having unisys in philadelphia
8245472 we recognize and support the efforts to grow develop and attract business to our city
8245473 although there are currently efforts under way to amend the zoning code the role of the board is to enforce the current zoning code
8245474 people do not want to live in an office building
8245475 but at the end of the day this is going to be senator obamas decision it is not a negotiation this is senator obamas show
8245476 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8245477 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8245478 part of the the problem now is that these conventions are so heavily covered that the images are more important than the substance
8245479 so i can understand the desire of party leaders to present as harmonious a front as possible
8245480 now the media often grades the conventions on how harmonious they are
8245481 if there is any discord thats held against the party
8245482 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8245483 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8245484 he is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful
8245485 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8245486 you know were democrats theres always somebody complaining about something
8245487 but i dont think anybody is distraught that ed rendell has compared sen obama to adlai stevenson
8245488 im just here to cover the most important state in the union pennsylvanias going to decide the election
8245489 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico

8245572 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8245573 youll never know which part of the internet youll need

8245651 we begin by validating the current list of genes and improving the gene structure models using nimblegen tiled expression arrays the experimental results better delineate transcribed regions of the genome and guide the design of a comprehensive probe set for the 12 plex
8245652 in all 40 of the designed probes reside in unannotated regions no other array can easily afford this luxury in rapid time our transcription profiling experiments detect the co regulation of all identified genes and many yet unknown genes under a large range of conditions while simultaneously improving the genome annotation
8245653 use of the nimblegen 12 plex gene expression microarray is advantageous and more accurate than other platforms because it allows to run replicates within the same array that validate analysis within the same experiment
8245654 conducting array hybridization is relatively straightforward the analysis of the results is user friendly and does not require highly specialized informatics skills
8245655 the 12x135k arrays is a powerful tool for accomplishing high throughput gene expression profiling
8245656 combined with nimblegen custom design option and high probe density these arrays allow convenient and accurate analysis of a wide range of organisms from the simplest bacterium to complex mammals and plants these arrays will accelerate functional genomics research and support our goal of providing innovative solutions for faster and more accurate results

8245897 and as russia announced that it has recognized the two rebel regions of georgia south ossetia and abkhazia the gold bulls came back in force
8245898 russias move has been widely condemned by the international community and is adding significant support to the precious metals complex
8245899 national gold reserves have a confidence and stability building function
8245900 this function has become even more important given the geopolitical situation and the risks present in financial market developments
8245901 theyre being perceived as the evil empire theyre going to have to do some serious things to change it
8245902 the prospect of an increasingly aggressive petro rich russia which prefers the ruble in its oil trading could provide more volatility for both the dollar and oil

8245915 you cant discuss curing cancer and an adam sandler movie in the same context its more than absurd
8245916 there is no platform for a comparative discussion about the two i dont exist as a being in any true format and this conversation is completely superfluous if i actually existed id own a dog and be in pursuit of a playboy bunny like everybody else but thats not the case im not usually this crabby but babes bunnies and dogs are important and shouldnt be taken so lightly that writers invent shallow characters like me to discuss them im very disappointed
8245917 ive gotten sick watching movies a lot of times not cancer i dont think because i dont live with a dog that can tell me that but the two do share the same contextual space on occasion
8245918 i like movies and dogs and am against all illnesses i guess im simple that way thats why i like adam sandler you dont have to be too bright to watch his flicks of course you cant expect much from them no matter what your iq is

8245929 het is voor breda natuurlijk een enorme opsteker dat 3fm onze stad als thuisbasis voor deze actie heeft gekozen we realiseren ons terdege dat we aardig wat waar te maken hebben en dat kunnen we samen in deze stad en regio we investeren er flink in om een sociale stad te zijn we zetten veel in op zorg voor elkaar en sociale cohesie ook over de grenzen heen breda levert een bijdrage aan het realiseren van de vn millenniumdoelen en gaat bewust om met internationale solidariteit in die context sluiten de doelen van serious request aan bij onze ambities kortom we zullen als een goede gastheer voor deze actie zorgen en samen inzetten op een enorme opbrengst

8245938 we have discovered that a number of retailers have been affected by a point of sale compromise
8245939 we are in the lucky position that it was discovered quickly and the garda are working on it
8245940 garda have uncovered a lot of the devices and cctv footage we have a list of all the card numbers that have been used they have either been blocked or restrictions put on those cards
8245941 with the devices recovered it may just be that the cards were only saved and the criminals did not have a chance to get hold of the card numbers
8245942 there will be an emergency meeting with the garda the terminal vendors and the banks to try and close down on this
8245943 the criminals have been going into shops claiming to be engineers working on the terminals
8245944 staff are used to their bank officials coming to update terminals so unfortunately they have been able to do that
8245945 we have been working with a number of the larger chain stores to make sure that does not happen
8245946 the bar has been raised and we will have to set ambitious targets
8245947 we have already started to talk to the governing bodies of each sport about their plans
8245948 but compared to four years ago the running of sport here has become more professional
8245949 we are a small country and investing in sports where we have a chance of getting returns is the best way to go
8245950 track and field sports are central to the olympics and we will always support those but there are others like cycling rowing boxing and swimming that we have done well in and we will look to continue this
8245951 many of our best athletes play field games we need to do more to promote others and find people who are suited to them
8245952 we need to be able to invest in both our top level programmes and those aimed at increasing participation in sport
8245953 sometimes the expectations irish people have of what can be achieved are just not realistic
8245954 we set a target of six finalists or six top eight finishes in beijing and we more than achieved that

8245994 yes he got away with it good luck to him you cant change the result of the test series so its no good worrying about it
8245995 for me it doesnt totally tarnish it because what i did like about the england bowlers in that series was their wrist release and for the first 10 overs jones and flintoff got the new ball to swing beautifully but from the 20 to 45 over mark that is where the mints are helping

8246191 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

8246201 rice is our countrys most important food and is an integral part of our life and culture but few filipinos are aware that our staple food is in danger of gmo contamination the restaurant campaign we are launching today is not only an awareness drive to involve the public in the movement to keep our rice gmo free it also serves to assure consumers that the rice they are eating is free from these risky organisms which pose serious threats to biodiversity farmers livelihoods and human health
8246202 the bistro group recognizes the importance of protecting the countrys rice supply from gmo contamination and is proud to be the first to sign onto such a project led by greenpeace our participation is consistent with our going green initiatives and our companys people centered philosophy and our commitment extends beyond this campaign toward to conserving and preserving our environment
8246203 they are saying that we will be having savings of p430 million based on construction materials but we will incur additional costs amounting to more than p215 51 million in additional pipes alone not including the booster pumps that we have to procure
8246204 we are not against their development plans but we will not allow our plans to be compromised
8246205 hedcors proposal for a dcwd hedcor joint scheme will only result to some communities not benefiting in terms of access to municipal water from dcwds proposed use and development of the surface water at tamugan river through gravity
8246206 the confluence of the panigan and tamugan rivers is still the ideal location for dcwds proposed water supply facilities viewed from the aspects of location river slope terrain water quality and quantity watershed management and economy that will redound to greater benefits to the general public or the people of davao city by way of providing cheaper municipal water through less capital investment in water supply infrastructures
8246207 the benefits of the new indefinite stay visa will be easier to determine because we know that for every visa granted weve created 10 jobs
8246208 for example if his business is in the tourism industry he would have to secure a certification from the dot that hes employing at least 10 filipinos

8246245 you think this guy killed it with the ladies back in the day
8246246 shit yeah i gotta think dozens of mediocre women woke up in the back of that tour bus thinking they were in love only to have a half asleep mr lewis tell them that they been huey ed and to get the fuck out maybe he left a shoe box full of 100 bills next to the exit door and told them to grab a handful of dough on their way out for car fare and the occasional abortion

8246252 but hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential
8246253 my game two weeks ago was poor in america and i took a couple of weeks off the second week ive been practising up here at gleneagles every day i feel very confident now in trying to win this event
8246254 this course has five par fives and they are our scoring holes with four of them reachable in two shots for the longer hitters i feel im going to have to be slightly more aggressive to win here than is normal
8246255 im looking for another 20 yards off the tee i think ive got 15 yards of it so im still five short

8246262 define spam by the quality of the email itself not by the overall reputation of the company emailing them
8246263 the good news about those who open but dont click is that theyre able to see your images the bad news is you dont know whether theyre fully reviewing your e mail and not finding anything engaging enough to click on or whether your e mail was opened in the preview pane a for a second as they scrolled past it without looking to get to another message
8246264 this isn t to say e mail creative is unimportant but e mailers really do need to assess how much energy they re spending on creative relative to crafting the offer and hitting the right target i d bet an evening s worth of cigars and vodka martinis that most are spending 80 of their time focused on the part of their effort that affects 20 of their chances of success

8246274 deportivo quito mostr anoche personalidad en el estadio alfonso lastras ram rez del san luis potos pero eso no fue suficiente para evitar la derrota 3 1 en el cotejo de ida de la copa sudamericana
8246275 el cuadro chulla estuvo a 10 minutos de asegurar un valioso empate pero el golazo de braulio luna 80 de unos 28 metros y un penal dio la ventaja al san luis potos de cara a la revancha el 17 de septiembre
8246276 el dominio fue para los visitantes pero los delanteros no supieron traducir en goles esa superioridad y permitieron que el rival de a poco se asiente en la cancha y los complique

8246302 we won three medals in beijing and that gives us a lot of responsibility to keep the olympic momentum going
8246303 i see this as a great opportunity to promote olympic sports
8246304 we must now give our athletes the best opportunity so that they perform well at the london olympics in 2012
8246305 until now it was only cricket which is played by only 10 countries
8246306 but now we have olympic medallists who have won in competitions among over 200 countries olympic sports have come of age in the country
8246307 because if you do indeed love your children you will not seek this divorce

8246347 hes trialling in sydney on friday but ive got an open mind whether hell run in sydney or head straight to melbourne
8246348 hes qualified for the caulfield and melbourne cups again and is heading that way
8246349 last year he won three from four before he hurt his suspensory and missed the cup races
8246350 he had a slight foot problem before his caulfield win and we couldnt get his normal farrier to shoe him and that led to a slight suspensory problem
8246351 i didnt see him for six months before i got him ready to run first up in the stradbroke handicap which was the only race i knew hed get a suitable weight in the winter
8246352 i only gave him the two runs to test his leg and its fine
8246353 if i think its a suitable race hell run in the concorde but i havent made up my mind and havent got a rider yet
8246354 hes only a 1000 to 1100 metre horse but he did a good job to run second first up at eagle farm a fortnight ago

8246359 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
8246360 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8246361 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8246362 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function we now know that not all the enzymes in the cell are doing the same job just like in real estate its all about the location
8246363 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
8246364 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture

8246369 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8246370 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8246371 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8246372 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
8246373 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
8246374 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
8246375 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
8246376 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors
8246377 we think well see the same advantages with robotic kidney surgery as we have with robotic prostatectomy
8246378 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
8246379 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
8246380 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
8246381 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
8246382 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
8246383 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
8246384 the best way to limit the need for human rabies vaccine is simply to make sure pets are vaccinated we know that dogs and cats are not the most common animals found rabid in the united states but they are the animals most frequently involved in multiple human exposures
8246385 your local veterinarian plays a key role in controlling rabies
8246386 the avma believes proposition 2 standards for confining farm animals is admirable in its goal to improve the welfare of production farm animals however it ignores critical aspects of animal welfare that ultimately would threaten the well being of the very animals it strives to protect
8246387 proposition 2 may have negative impacts on animals consumers and the industry if its passed
8246388 we fully agree that more attention needs to be paid to the behavioral and social needs of food animals and proposition 2 is laudable in that it attempts to address these needs but the standards in this ballot initiative fall short in improving animal welfare because they fail to adequately consider other factors animal welfare is a complex issue and demands that decisions be based on science tempered with compassion and take into account all aspects of welfare changing housing standards without consideration of how this may affect other aspects of animal welfare such as protection from disease and injury will not be in the animals or societys best interest
8246389 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
8246390 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
8246391 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
8246392 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
8246393 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
8246394 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
8246395 we also think that brk would be an ideal clinical marker than could be used to provide both a diagnosis and prognosis for breast cancer
8246396 as committed we are giving early notice to our partners so that they can prepare to meet their patients needs
8246397 doctors told us that early communication is critical to mitigating isotope shortages by maintaining open lines of communication with this protocol we expect to minimize the impact on medical treatment for canadians
8246398 our government is monitoring this developing situation and is working closely with atomic energy of canada limited and suppliers in an effort to help ensure a consistent supply of medical isotopes for canadians
8246399 we are in discussions with suppliers to ensure minimal impact to the canadian supply of isotopes
8246400 we are working to ensure that canadians will have the isotopes they need the health and safety of canadians is always our foremost concern
8246401 doctors and healthcare institutions have flexibility in scheduling non urgent procedures which require medical isotopes given this amount of notice we encourage them to take advantage of this flexibility in the weeks ahead
8246402 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8246403 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension
8246404 our aim is to raise awareness on the benefits and risks of high doses of vitamins and minerals says susan j whiting phd author of the review our understanding of the function of nutrients now goes beyond just prevention of classical deficiency diseases to possible prevention of disease for those people for whom vitamin and mineral supplements are needed we want to assure them that the benefit out weighs the risk

8246414 we are not controlling it and are not blockading it this is nonsense
8246415 battleships do not normally deliver aid and this is gunboat diplomacy it does not make the situation more stable

8246420 professionalism has become a buzzword in recent years but its not always clear what this really means however the expectations placed on todays doctors have increased tremendously with patients who are increasingly well informed the imposition of targets growing caseloads and the growing burden of regulation this workshop will help doctors to reflect on what tactics they can employ to practice in this demanding environment

8246424 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
8246425 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
8246426 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
8246427 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
8246428 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
8246429 the study confirmed that olive leaf extract efla 943 has antihypertensive properties in humans

8246431 complacency is enemy number one when it comes to preparing for another influenza pandemic
8246432 these stories told so eloquently by survivors family members and friends from past pandemics serve as a sobering reminder of the devastating impact that influenza can have and reading them is a must for anyone involved in public health preparedness
8246433 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8246434 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8246435 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care

8246437 many studies have noted the fact that rls has a far reaching symptom spectrum that can severely impact and limit several aspects of everyday life the pramipexole clinical trials reinforce the need for a simple effective treatment for people with rls to address these symptoms including limb pain and associated mood disorder in addition to the characteristic rls symptoms these important new findings reaffirm pramipexole as an effective pharmacological regimen for the treatment of rls the studies have proven that pramipexole can offer patient specific benefits which combined can lead to significant improvement of patients overall quality of life

8246439 our foodchek tm e coli test will have a major impact for both regulatory agencies and meat processors potential food contaminants such as e coli o157 h7 can now be tested on site and identified prior to the end of a production shift foodchek tm e coli eliminates the need for slaughterhouses and meat processors to hold finished products in cold storage until testing can be completed by off site third parties
8246440 but it might leave a few streaks to be buffed off
8246441 children are particularly vulnerable there are reports of children being killed injured or gone missing due to the fighting
8246442 we also received reports from partners which indicate an increase in the number of unaccompanied children who have been separated from their family relatives and communities some of them are very young children under seven years old isolated from their supportive environments these children are most vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse as well as exploitation as cheap or free labour
8246443 lack of access is a major issue that we are facing today although humanitarian interventions are ongoing our ability to respond quickly and effectively with high impact has been undermined significantly due to the deteriorating security conditions
8246444 all parties involved in the conflict must prioritize civilians safety and well being especially children and ensure access for humanitarian organizations
8246445 these survey findings reveal the dismal state of uk cancer management despite significant advances in the treatment of myeloma such as revlimid the majority of patients cannot get access to new life extending drugs until they have been appraised and approved by nice a process that can take up to three years from when the drug is first licensed in the uk patients with active myeloma require effective treatment to improve their chances of survival the impact of waiting even a month for treatment can result in a life or death situation
8246446 it is appalling that myeloma patients cannot get access to life extending treatments which are widely available throughout europe post code prescribing is rife in the uk with some patients getting access to life extending treatments ahead of a nice decision whilst others are left to die myeloma uk wants to engage with the department of health to find a solution to this growing issue

8246448 the infants living there urgently need complimentary food and the older children require nutrition rich food such as fruit and vegetables there is also a need for diapers and other hygiene supplies as well as recreational equipment instances of head lice chicken pox and fungal infections have been reported there is virtually no regular health services or access to medicine nor psycho social support
8246449 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
8246450 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
8246451 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice often in direct opposition to their personal convictions
8246452 during my practice as an ob gyn i witnessed this first hand but health care providers shouldnt have to check their conscience at the hospital door this proposed rule will help ensure that doesnt happen
8246453 these data are exciting because they demonstrate that recombinant vlps are a valid and potent vaccine approach against influenza combined with our innovative manufacturing approach our vlp vaccine candidate has the potential to address an unmet need in pandemic influenza preparedness efforts being planned by health authorities around the world
8246454 this data milestone marks good progress in the viability of novavaxs vaccine which combined with ge healthcares ready to use bioprocessing technologies signals the promise of a solution to problems countries face in preparing for the inevitability of pandemic influenza
8246455 in the face of a global health threat innovations are required that can deliver safe and effective vaccines quickly and reliably
8246456 two doses of this novel vaccine which is designed to prevent bird flu gave strong immune responses the data are encouraging that this new vaccine approach can help prevent pandemic influenza

8246464 dont really consider my 2 stepkids their grandkids because theyre not biologically their grandkids
8246465 shes practically on her own amp its not like we see her or have a relationship with her at all
8246466 it occurred to me as she built to the conclusion in the last few minutes that the pre 2008 hillary clinton would not have been capable of that speech thats not a dig but she grew incredibly as a candidate over the course of this campaign and this was an immensely powerful delivery and a richly woven together speech the beginning seemed fine but not remarkable but it slowly built into something very powerful
8246467 hillary clinton obviously doesnt like barack obama and shes clearly hesitant about the prospect of him as president
8246468 but she delivered the best speech she could honestly give for him
8246469 if she was more enthusiastic it probably would have sounded phony but clinton did seem to realize that politics is about more than herself and
8246470 maybe simply ignoring obama and ripping mccain was the best approach
8246471 after all her hardest core supporters probably arent going to be convinced that obama is awesome and as an anti mccain speech it was great plus on purely aesthetic grounds

8246484 now john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage
8246485 never to my knowledge has there been such a concerted effort to bring the public together with the experts who hold the most knowledge about an area of human illness that accounts for more loss and devastation than any other
8246486 mental illness is so prevalent in our society estimated to affect as many as one in four north americans in any given year with one in 10 suffering serious chronic conditions
8246487 more individuals and families are speaking out today than ever before about the pain and loss caused by mental illness
8246488 we hope that people who are coping with mental illness their friends and loved ones and mental health professionals will all attend these forums to learn about the progress thats being made in understanding and treating mental illness and why there is reason for hope for improved treatments and even cures if research can continue to flourish
8246489 government funding for mental health research has remained flat in the united states and probably wont get better any time soon
8246490 but we cant wait for the government too many lives are at stake and we must not lose momentum in the pace of discovery weve achieved over the past two decades
8246491 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do

8246501 ampia spiegazione in relazione al riconoscimento russo dellindipendenza dellossezia del sud e dellabkhazia
8246502 i 27 capi di stato e di governo evidentemente reagiranno
8246503 fuori dalla legge internazionale e questa non solo lopinione dellunione europea
8246504 altri obiettivi fra i quali la crimea lucraina la moldavia
8246505 non e un passo compiuto alla leggera o senza una completa valutazione delle sue conseguenze
8246506 ignorando gli avvertimenti della russia ha affermato il presidente i paesi occidentali si sono precipitati a riconoscere la illegale dichiarazione di indipendenza del kosovo
8246507 dopo di ci noi abbiamo sostenuto con coerenza che sarebbe stato impossibile dire agli abkhazi e agli osseti e a decine di altri gruppi nel mondo che cio che andava bene per gli albanesi del kosovo non andava bene per loro
8246508 nelle relazioni internazionali non si possono avere due pesi e due misure
8246509 solo un pazzo avrebbe potuto rischiare cos credeva davvero che la russia sarebbe rimasta ferma mentre lui dava lassalto alla citta addormentata di tskhinvali uccidendo centinaia di civili in maggioranza cittadini russi
8246510 la russia ha aggiunto non aveva altra scelta che reprimere lattacco per salvare vite non stata una guerra da noi voluta noi non abbiamo mire sul territorio georgiano
8246511 possa un giorno avere i leader che merita che abbiano a cuore il loro paese e che instaurino relazioni di reciproco rispetto con tutti i popoli del caucaso

8246515 il reclutamento degli insegnanti il cui ruolo stato fortemente spersonalizzato e ridotto e triste spiega un sistema in cui la sola anzianit rappresenta unoccasione di avanzamento occorre invece premiare chi vale concretamente questo significa continua anche aprire alla contrattazione differenziata e alla valutazione degli insegnanti
8246516 la valutazione la priorit chiarisce non nel trovare pi soldi ma nello spendere meglio va aumentato con un sistema premiale il peso specifico di ogni singola ora di insegnamento
8246517 la qualit della scuola si vede anche dalla qualit degli istituti scolastici in senso fisico oggi lincuria ha troppo spesso invaso le scuole che devono essere rese non solo sicure ma pulite accoglienti

8246519 quando ho letto il copione ha spiegato devo confessare di essermi un p preoccupato evidentemente i coen devono avere di me unimmagine particolare se mi hanno scelto per questo ruolo del resto con loro ho fatto tre film e in tutti e tre recitavo un personaggio non proprio geniale alla fine con loro faccio sempre la parte dello scemo anche se penso che il mio personaggio sia in realt intelligente
8246520 per me stata la prima volta con ethane joel coen da tre anni volevo lavorare con loro e sono stato felice quando mi hanno chiamato certo ammette quando ho letto il copione e decifrato il mio ruolo non mi sono sentito particolarmente lusingato ma stato davvero divertente lavorare con loro
8246521 c qualcosa di casuale in questo film ha spiegato straordinario scoprire che anche a washington possono capitare errori piuttosto gravi certo lo sospettavamo tutti ha aggiunto mi piaciuto soprattutto interpretare il ruolo di una donna perennemente arrabbiata e molto realistico

8246530 it helps but if you have an 80 mile an hour wind with golf ball sized hail youre going to have damage
8246531 a hail ding when its small might affect the apples look but not the taste
8246532 its a safe bet that pricing is going to be up the silver lining to the stormy weather is that the apples had plenty of moisture and well have good sized apples
8246533 the first few games were difficult for me i think im almost 100 hopefully the next game i will get better

8246562 there must be 500 trees or more down throughout the course
8246563 it picked up a full 45 gallon water barrel and tossed it across the yard like it was empty

8246595 and i would say well yes john im a senator from mississippi and were the poorest state in the nation
8246596 but you know what in my heart i knew he was right
8246597 it got out of control with republicans and thats why we are being punished a little bit
8246598 because we forgot how we got there what we believed in the principles that after 30 years put us in the majority gave us the white house the congress the senate the house and then we ran out of ideas
8246599 what we have been able to glean is that the journalists the canadian the australian and the somali are unharmed they have their clothes theyre getting food regularly and they may even have access to satellite tv
8246600 i cant say more than that you can understand that the group may be afraid of a possible armed mission to rescue the journalists
8246601 but the way things have gone in somalia from what we know and from what weve seen in the past thats not necessarily a bad thing that theres been no demand yet
8246602 in the case of some italian aid workers kidnapped a while ago in somalia it took seven to 10 days before any contact was made so you see were still early on
8246603 somalia is a dangerous place there are a lot of various factions and many of them have guns its a confusing place
8246604 the story line we wanted to be similar in them to ft1 so it revolved around a large corporation and the territorial governor concocting a plot to replace all paved highways with hover pads to help make the hover mini vans and family hover cars safer and faster of course this plan didnt sit well with the bikers and truckers who were going to unit to fight this plot at a rally the evil governor had secretly hired the rotwheelers to assassinate father torque the leader of this new alliance at the rally so the first half the game ben tries to stop the assassination and the second half he teams up with a persistent undercover female reporter to bring the governor down and uncover his nefarious secret

8246609 we then worked with sega to determine which features would be the best for the game and came up with a list that felt good
8246610 we had people constantly playing the game from the moment it was up and running on the wii
8246611 to gauge the opinions about the wii version we created playtesting sessions that included folks who had played the original games only a few times alongside hardcore samba fans that had mastered the original using the data from these different types of players we were able to make sure the game felt rock solid for the new player and hardcore samba fan alike

8246638 research groups at mit have used titan analog migration successfully for design of key analog circuits such as high speed links and ultra wide band radios
8246639 this is an important effort as it transforms the analog ic design methodology and provides complete flexibility
8246640 model based design is a key enabling technology for top down analog design our students have had great success in designing complex mixed signal circuits utilizing titan analog migration
8246641 not only does it help designers think about circuits analytically it also enables them to push the power performance envelope and optimize circuits across a comprehensive range of pvt scenarios magmas titan analog migration has been instrumental in exploring the feasible boundaries of a design specification for various process technologies and circuit topologies
8246642 titan analog migration is industry proven technology and we are very pleased by its adoption at mit and ucla
8246643 titan analog migration enables true top down analog design similar to the digital design methodology pioneered 20 years ago we are confident that the analog students will be in the forefront of designing advanced analog mixed signal blocks with our technology and can demonstrate substantial productivity improvements and better circuit performance for their analog ip
8246644 we are seeing strong interest from 2 seat craft that need more power torque than a two stroke engine can provide but dont want to incur the weight and cost of other options
8246645 this diverse range of early adopters will influence future customers we are targeting specific sport aircraft new and retrofit powered parachutes and the rapidly growing market for larger hovercraft
8246646 we have experienced a number of sport aircraft that are restricted by the size and mounting configuration of the engine compartment
8246647 our new belt drive is being installed in a number of these craft allowing them to benefit from a more robust engine than alternative two strokes now with both a range of gear boxes and a flexible belt drive option aerotwin can meet the power needs of most sport aircraft
8246648 in recent months we have been working with aircraft owners and consultants prop manufacturers and consultants and our consulting aeronautical engineer to properly match our engine to major sport aircraft types
8246649 early application designs generally have resulted in matching a longer and heavier prop geared to lower engine rpms this is possible with aerotwin due to high torque over a broad useable rpm range the benefits include shorter takeoff distances at less throttle lower engine operating temperatures and less noise
8246650 while our engine development has been lengthy and costly we are very excited about recent progress and especially the robust performance we are seeing from the proper matching of our engine and props in specific sport aircraft types
8246651 as this performance becomes widely known we expect rapid market acceptance of our light quiet and powerful four stroke engines over the coming months

8246800 decision management is a natural evolution of business intelligence when we focus on decisions we need a much richer understanding of what data is new immersive ways to view data and most importantly the ability to richly collaborate with colleagues this is decision catalyst

8246804 compressing streams at their full resolution and frame rate retains all the detail within a scene with complete fluidity of motion current solutions compromise on frame rates and resolutions because they lack processing capability

8246806 the production team of complete mini pc systems have really achieved outstanding work and created a fully featured mini pc that will be difficult to beat when it comes to value for money
8246807 based on customer feedback rave developed the hybrid ultra 24 to support sun customers who required full height length pci cards in a rackmount format
8246808 we modified the sun ultra 24 and developed a lightweight high capacity rackmount workstation with features that are not available in suns currently x86 product offerings
8246809 the costs of non compliance with power management policies can be just as high as the costs associated with non compliance with security or regulatory policies thats why weve introduced the green it power management option pack
8246810 organizations can now easily add power management policies to their triumfant platform to continuously monitor and control their pc environment and ensure compliance with all critical policies and the cost of the green it option pack is far less than the cost of similar stand alone solutions
8246811 the integrin alpha v beta 3 protein plays an important key role in many disease pathways which is one of the key reasons we selected this as a first imaging target with our collaborators at merck

8246817 we have prepared three sketches of suspects based on description given by an eye witness who saw them planting the bombs in different parts of the city
8246818 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe
8246819 it seems that the material for bombs came from outside the state but it is likely that they were assembled here since items like batteries and watches are found locally we believe that the assembly could have been done here
8246820 the all new workforce line is epsons solution for the micro business consumer

8246824 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8246825 when they put the crown on my head i felt an adrenalin rush that i have never felt before in my life
8246826 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalized entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8246827 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8246828 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8246829 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8246830 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8246831 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8246832 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8246833 just like who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed
8246834 engineers are shaping computers now so that those who work at them will be only keyboard operators

8246842 der mann war depressiv wegen einer silvesterfeier ohne seine familie aber er war nicht voller hass und zorn
8246843 ich habe einen schweren fehler gemacht aber ich hatte das nicht geplant
8246844 es ist eine gro e trag die die ich angestiftet habe
8246845 wir haben sicherlich die st rkere mannschaft aber wir m ssen ganz anders auftreten als gegen leverkusen
8246846 die aufstellung wird nicht so sein dass v llig andere leute spielen das l sst auch das ergebnis gar nicht zu
8246847 er wird nicht von anfang an spielen aber je nach spielverlauf werde ich ihn vielleicht einwechseln
8246848 der anspruch des vereins ist es international zu spielen und die spieler wollen das auch ich habe noch keinen geh rt der gesagt hat das interessiert mich nicht
8246849 aber wenn man als spieler diese h heren ziele hat muss man doppelbelastungen auch wegstecken k nnen
8246850 das war ein paradebeispiel die hatten von anfang an eine super einstellung die wir am letzten samstag nicht hatten
8246851 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8246852 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8246853 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination and shes cute
8246854 united are bludgeoned by the power of money finance 4 romance 0
8246855 its no disgrace being beaten by a team like that
8246856 they are a good side who play good football and in the second half they gave us a tanking weve got to take it players at championship level are faster with the ball and without the ball he ledesma was the instigator for all that
8246857 we got close to coming into this division last year but its a massive step looking at that second 45 minutes weve got a lot to do
8246858 we did ok in the first half and we had a shout for a penalty
8246859 iain dowie was quiet at the time he didnt tell me i was wrong to shout for it but you either get them or you dont
8246860 we knew if we could pinch a goal we could give them a problem but there werent many concerns for them after 47 minutes
8246861 they have always been a massive danger at set plays because their delivery is fantastic we warned the players about that at half time and then within a minute or two we conceded off one
8246862 the best team has won end of story but i dont regret winning at shrewsbury in the last round to get this game its better coming here and having this opportunity than going out in the first round and wondering where we might have been
8246863 gary will remember that for a long time but he wont enjoy it
8246864 we will be back in on thursday we will be strong and we will be ready for saturdays match against yeovil
8246865 some of the inexpensive hardware doesnt exist right now and most basic utility meters are not designed to be hooked up to the internet
8246866 the premier league is one of the best if not the best league in the world so it would be fantastic if i got the chance to play there
8246867 to go and play in england is absolutely something that i would love to do you never know when that chance might come but it is something that i hope can happen
8246868 whether it is this year next year or in five years i want to play in the premier league and test myself against some of the best players in the world
8246869 the competitiveness and the passion in the game over in england would suit my style then there is the speed of the games themselves which makes it very entertaining to watch and im sure it would be great to play in too
8246870 transport police report sectarian offences eradicated in all but one club
8246871 the 2007 2008 season was definitely a challenging one for us alcohol fuelled disorder was the most prevalent problem with an increase from 305 to 337 incidents we also had 25 police officers assaulted during the season the highest number ever recorded by btp
8246872 we did however get a better grip on organised hooligan elements through increased use of football banning orders on known trouble makers consequently we had a reduction in serious incidents from 83 in the 2006 07 season to 63 last season
8246873 in the same time period we secured 122 football banning orders with many cases still pending
8246874 this is something we will continue to pursue to ensure that those who engage in disorder are banned from travelling to or from attending football matches
8246875 we will use all the tools at our disposal to rid the railway system of football troublemakers
8246876 with the ever expanding list of fixtures including the creation of the european champions league the pressures on us as a force to provide policing for multiple matches in multiple leagues across the country has never been greater
8246877 a forum which brings together key groups from the railway industry the fa football league and premier league supporters associations and btp has been also been set up to work through any issues that may be causing concern
8246878 we would appeal to fans ahead of the new football season not to over indulge in alcohol
8246879 officers will be out in force across the country monitoring fixtures and working with football clubs and colleagues from other forces to ensure each match is policed successfully and with the minimum amount of trouble
8246880 and the viciousness of that attack indicates just how foregone a conclusion it is
8246881 in the african american community there are those who think that they may have been neglected by kip
8246882 the new app is based on sports tracker which has been a huge hit since it launched out of beta
8246883 i do not even want to talk about losing him
8246884 he is absolutely top notch around the club around the training ground he is getting better and better every game
8246885 once you have played 30 games for the under 21s you deserve a crack at the big time
8246886 he is as good as if not better than some of the lads who have had a chance
8246887 he is one that fabio capello should have a serious look at capello needs to talk to a few people he might not know james but those around him should
8246888 the situation with robbie is still up in the air so he wont be involved against grimsby
8246889 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved
8246890 im not unsure about robbie im just unsure as to when it will get done
8246891 i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing but the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money
8246892 i always tell my players that if they win games they win trophies and then they will have higher wages and more money we need to win silverware so we will be better in all of these areas
8246893 do our finances in any way depend on getting through no i dont think so it is not about money it is about winning
8246894 we know the champions league is a fantastic competition and it is really really important that we go through and that we can approach the game against aston villa with confidence
8246895 i dont like to talk about the supporters in this case because when you say you need the supporters it implies that you did not have the support before
8246896 we always have our supporters backing the team they know how important this game is to the team so they will be supporting them from the first minute to the end
8246897 that is always their way you cannot say anything about the fans they are the best
8246898 if im asked 100 times whether we will win and go through to the champions league 100 times i will say yes
8246899 if i had thought like that in 2004 i would have left after two matches
8246900 i dont want five points i want nine points from three matches the idea is to have the maximum
8246901 not at all this is the first ive heard about it nobody has said to me you can start again but you will have a knife under your throat
8246902 he wants to be part of the team and to go with us to south africa
8246903 i want him with us but i want the real patrick vieira the one i know not a weak and injured player
8246904 i told him forget about dates and dont fix objectives it is your body that will tell you if you are in a good shape or not
8246905 the french shirt is important and he knows it he knows what im looking for and he is still open he says at my age i dont have the power but he is still happy when i call him
8246906 what does concern me is the relationship that fernando torres and steven gerrard have achieved
8246907 they are two fine players and have a fine link something they have struck up very quickly as players it is very important to liverpool they know each others game very well
8246908 but then liverpool can be dangerous from every part of the field we will have to be very careful if i was 30 years younger i would love to be involved myself
8246909 over three or four years at steaua i cannot say to anyone that we were the best but we were beating the best
8246910 for standard to win here would be comparable to anything i achieved as a player at steaua

8246913 a deal has been agreed between the clubs and the transfer may be concluded by thursday
8246914 ultimately a deep bench is crucial to winning this coming sunday and i expect a completely different pistolas team than last night
8246915 well have our keeper back our scoring leader and a host of other lethal weapons the key for us is really a deep bench weve now played two years together and had a great run this year were capable of beating any team in this league if we communicate pass well and get back to support our stellar defense we have by far the best keeper in the league we have guys coming off well desrved rest in eckleton andrew t eddy m davidinho and ronaldo if all goes to plan i expect a squad of 18 motivated guys this sunday looking to seek revenge on this silver team there are many different options and weapons on this team but the determination and heart is going to really be important in pulling together take no team lightly lets win this sunday boys
8246916 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
8246917 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
8246918 well end of the day all i want to do is play football
8246919 ronaldo is shit and i didnt even want him anyway
8246920 i dont want to talk about losing james milner hes absolutely top notch

8246926 we are fighting to qualify for the final round in angola
8246927 we have tried to balance the team by bringing in a lot of experience in this selection as this is going to be a very difficult game against nigeria
8246928 may i add that a win against nigeria will not mean we should get carried away
8246929 it is a game which is as important as the one against equatorial guinea because we must not lose sight of the bigger picture which is the 2010 world cup
8246930 ya al final despu s de lo que ha sucedido en los ltimos 19 meses el barack obama que yo conozco hoy es el mismo del que me enamor hace 19 a os

8246950 she is awesome i felt so much power and wisdom from hillary tonight
8246951 i felt a little pain within her its like she felt sorry for us that we didnt get the candidate we wanted
8246952 she made clear that shes supporting barack obama that her campaign is over and the only way to continue fighting for the issues she believes in is by electing him
8246953 its about the people who dont have health insurance the people whose kids dont have goods schools the people who are fighting to pay their bills
8246954 i would be lying if i said oh im so excited im not excited about barack but clinton said cast your vote for barack and joe biden im going to do what hillary said to do
8246955 but we need to see them working together as we move forward
8246956 you know that we dont panic here you hit the panic button it just gets worse right right
8246957 its not like ice skating where you know what routine is going to come its always going to be something different every game hopefully we can keep finding different ways to win

8246977 wir haben sicherlich die st rkere mannschaft aber wir m ssen ganz anders auftreten als gegen leverkusen
8246978 die aufstellung wird nicht so sein dass v llig andere leute spielen das l sst auch das ergebnis gar nicht zu

8247012 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8247013 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8247014 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8247015 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8247016 its right along their theme of trying to put president bush and john mccain together which of course john mccain has made such a point of being an independent
8247017 that is one of the great things about him he really calls his own shots and he agrees when he really does and hes willing to disagree if he doesnt
8247018 the democratic party seems to be two democratic parties the party of hillary rodham clinton and the party of barack obama
8247019 the main thing is the fact is barack obama hasnt put the party together yet and were looking at september 1
8247020 this was her time to make her case for barack obama

8247059 well i must say the handover ceremony was a complete disgrace it really seemed like some nursery panto compared to the no expense spared west end show which was done by the people of beijing absolutely no idea how to market london
8247060 i was ashamed to watch the handover the whole london 2012 thing is cheap tackey sic and so inappropriate imagine a rock concert with punk rockers outside buck palace imagine a london mayor tie askew hands in pocket at the birdsnest sic god help us we will be the laughing stock of the world
8247061 unlike the chinese custom which tends not to reveal their weakness to the outsiders the british seem to like to laugh about their stupidity in a funny way during the performance when the london bus pulled over all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time which truly damaged the british image

8247087 puede imaginarse lo que fue para los abjasos ver cerrada su universidad de sujumi por el gobierno de tiflis bajo el argumento de que supuestamente no ten an una lengua adecuada o una historia o cultura por lo que no necesitaban una universidad
8247088 ik zit de hele dag te fiedelen als een kind in een zandbak
8247089 missie is een groot woord maar ik zorg er graag voor dat wat in oude boeken staat de nieuwe mens onder ogen komt want er staan dingen in oude boeken die tot mijn spijt tegenwoordig niet meer de moeite waard zijn om te weten dus daar pest ik mensen graag mee wie weet nou nog dat hitler achter was met de betaling van zijn contributie voor de herdershondenvereniging ik vind dat belangrijk
8247090 die daden zijn bekend maar dit detail geeft toch een menselijk aspect aan het beest
8247091 in het kleine zie je het grote weerspiegeld ik kan geen filosofieboeken lezen en door die handicap ben ik dus wel gedwongen het in het kleine en eenvoudige te zoeken als troost heb ik maar de gedachte aangenomen dat de microkosmos gelijk staat aan de macrokosmos daar kan ik dan altijd mee aankomen als mensen zeggen dat ze in mijn boeken door de bomen het bos niet meer zien dan zeg ik in de boom zit het hele bos
8247092 het komt erop neer dat je omgeving meer gaat leven als je meer details over die omgeving te weten komt een bioloog bijvoorbeeld maakt veel meer mee op een wandeling dan jij en ik hij ziet een bijzondere plant of een dood konijn in het gras liggen dingen waar wij overheen zouden kijken
8247093 het zat er al vroeg in ik las vanaf mijn tiende elke zondagmiddag in de encyclopedie als ik bij deel z was aanbeland was ik deel a alweer vergeten en kon ik weer opnieuw beginnen ik wilde in principe overal iets over weten het was ook een sociaal principe want ik wilde met iedereen een gesprek kunnen voeren van putjesschepper tot sterrenkundige en dat helpt inderdaad enorm als je met iemand in een caf zit te praten en vraagt en wat doe jij en vervolgens een vakterm laat vallen dan vallen alle barri res weg
8247094 vroeger was mijn verzameling een veelvoud van wat hier staat ik had honderdvijftig meter boeken staan de woonkamer keuken en nog een complete boekenkamer stonden vol boekenkasten maar toen ik ben verhuisd heb ik veel weggedaan waaronder veertien encyclopedie n nu er internet is heb je ook veel minder boeken nodig
8247095 absoluut het is heerlijk om op internet rond te struinen en ik kan er ook goed mijn weg vinden maar ik gebruik mijn computer ook vaak om te photoshoppen ik ben lid van een club genaamd batafysica vernoemd naar de patafysica de wetenschap die zich bezighoudt met de oplossing van denkbeeldige problemen bijvoorbeeld de zijwindgevoeligheid van de optelsom of de oppervlakte van god naast mijn voorzitterschap van de afdelingen groentolochie en conectologie ben ik ook beeldbankbeheerder in die hoedanigheid heb ik afbeeldingen gemaakt van de bij ons aangesloten drentse raketclub van een experimenten in de verticaliseringsstudies en ga zo maar door dat fotoshoppen werd wel een verslaving ik heb in drie maanden bijna 260 afbeeldingen bij elkaar gephotoshopt die zijn nu allemaal op onze website te bewonderen en er is zelfs een tentoonstelling aan gewijd in arte et amicitiae
8247096 volgens mij komt het doordat ik de vijftig ben gepasseerd
8247097 de titel van het boek komt uit een gedicht van mijn pseudoniem arno breedveld oh wonder en verrukking oh prachtig evenwicht de klinkende ikken spatten van ons allen af mijn persoonlijkheid zo denk ik weleens bestaat uit meer dan n en in dit boek probeer ik al die ikken bij elkaar te drijven ik maak gebruik van de methode van de omcirkeling door uiteenlopende onderwerpen te behandelen de lanbouw rai mijn grlorietijd als jongen in terwispel enzovoorts hoop ik uiteindelijk een compleet beeld van mijzelf neer te zetten puur holisme eigenlijk je kan het ook zo zien al mijn ikken zijn op een gegeven moment van huis gegaan maar nemen dan het besluit om terug naar huis te gaan want ze willen weten waar ze vandaan komen op de stoep voor het huis komen ze elkaar tegen maar niemand heeft de sleutel meer bij zich dus kijken ze zon beetje om zich heen en praten wat dat is mijn boek
8247098 soms komt het daar wel op neer er zijn dagen waarop ik me katholiek voel en dan schrijf ik hele katholieke stukken lees ik augustinus en dan denk ik over willen jan otten dat hij toch echt mijn dierbaarste collega is maar er zijn ook dagen dat ik een papenvreter ben en dan moeten de katholieken juist aan de hoogste boom zo gaat het ook met mijn pseudoniem arno breekveld ik ben geen echte dichter maar hij wel dus sommige dagen ben ik een tijdje breekveld en dan schrijf ik een paar gedichten die persoonlijkheidwisselingen zijn nu wel wat minder geworden maar er zijn fotos waar ik echt als breekveld op sta met een soort waanzin in mijn oogopslag
8247099 dat vind ik helemaal niet hoge en lage cultuur kunnen heel goed samengaan in dit nummer staan prachtige fotos van het huwelijk van frans bauer toegegeven ik kijk er wel met enige afstand naar want die bauer is natuurlijk een onnozelaar maar hij is ook een held van onze tijd en dat huwelijk van hem is zo overdreven die kerk is met zoveel tierelantijnen opgesierd dat het me wel aanspreekt uiteindelijk komt het bij mij hierop neer al het uitzonderlijke is interessant

8247209 our accomplishments with expense reduction were not sufficient to offset large disappointments in sales and gross margin
8247210 we have always wanted to diversify the farm in a positive fashion and this is one way of doing it
8247211 it is something completely different but it takes into account the surfing at newquay and brings it all together
8247212 artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects
8247213 ministers must act to help the thousands of families struggling to keep a roof over their heads
8247214 the government should allow councils and housing associations to buy up land as well as empty homes to help replenish britains much depleted stock of social housing
8247215 ministers must also tighten up repossession rules to ensure that peoples homes are only ever repossessed as a last resort
8247216 if youre really interested in making your relationship work little rituals are a great way to do it
8247217 every marriage has what i call a relationship reservoir or the stored up emotional energy of the relationship
8247218 honey what do you think is the one thing most important to a successful marriage
8247219 it all started one winter night years ago when julie had had a really bad day
8247220 we were huddled under the covers of our bed and julie was describing how all the people who made her day miserable were bad polar bears and how she didnt want any of the bad polar bears coming into the bedroom and how the bed was our refuge from them you realize how embarrassing it is to admit this right anyway thats when we started calling the bed the igloo
8247221 its our little sanctuary only nice things happen in the igloo
8247222 its funny because i always thought that when you lived with somebody youd automatically know everything that was going on
8247223 but we find that if we dont take that time to connect with each other its really easy for life to get in the way the igloo offers one of the few times in the day where theres not a whole heck of a lot else going on so youre able to focus on each other in a deeper way
8247224 but its always a nice way for us to catch up
8247225 hes just my best friend and our marriage is a great partnership and theres no one id rather talk to
8247226 because we know plenty of married couples who fight a lot about how often they have sex the wifes upset because all he ever wants to do is have sex the husbands upset because he doesnt think they have sex enough but this has never really been a problem with us and i think it has a lot do with the fact that were always talking sexy to each other
8247227 were always complimenting each other tossing out fantasies telling each other were hot he gets to feel like he can have sexual feelings and i feel like i dont have to have sex all the time to appear attractive
8247228 lets put it this way the way i see it sex is like chocolate cake after five days of eating chocolate cake even chocolate cake doesnt taste that great
8247229 we are so disgusting this is so pathetic its like a sickness
8247230 look we get a kick out of it because its so ridiculous its our guilty pleasure
8247231 honestly i think we just need to be dumb for a while
8247232 were both very into our careers and when youre at work with any job theres going to be a certain amount of professional stress you like to come home sometimes and for that lousy hour or whatever kick back and relax
8247233 life is serious enough isnt it sometimes you need to do something stupid and if you cant be stupid with your husband who can you be stupid with
8247234 honey dont forget at 7 15 we have our nightly cuddle followed by the affirmation of our vows our 7 35 spontaneous flirtation and then of course a new episode of
8247235 you know that old saying how can i miss you if you dont go away
8247236 doing things separately gives you a chance to fill in the blanks that your partner cant fill in for you for example one of you likes classical music the other one likes sports plus taking a break from each other gives you more things to talk about because when youre joined at the hip whats to talk about youve already seen it all
8247237 as a woman you get this message that when you get married you spend every single waking second with your husband and youre so unbelievably happy
8247238 and my parents actually do spend every single waking second together and oddly enough they are happy
8247239 and yeah they spent every moment together but they spent every moment together at each others throats
8247240 so joe had to convince me that having our own lives was a good idea
8247241 it all brings a freshness to our marriage because we both continue to grow as people
8247242 getting out of the house and out of each others hair keeps us from going crazy
8247243 we have been married for seven years but praying together is something we didnt start doing until about a year ago
8247244 in the past whenever we faced big decisions wed have discussion after discussion about them but wed never really come to a resolution
8247245 i soon found that praying together brings out a real sense of selflessness and humility
8247246 when youre praying for each other not yourself youre focused together and speaking from the heart on a whole different level i would never have predicted this for us but it really works
8247247 as bad as any problem may seem at that moment
8247248 prayer always helps us see beyond it it doesnt have to be a long drawn out scripture reading just a few minutes a day when we pray it brings another level of honesty to our conversations i think its the most intimate thing you can do with another person
8247249 we just join hands and let it rip whether were asking for forgiveness or giving thanks saying it out loud holds a lot of power
8247250 besides regardless of religion or spiritual preference i think that most marriages require a ton of faith
8247251 youve got to believe that somehow the two of you are going to make it through things youve got to believe that youre being blessed with this person and even if the power we feel just comes from the strength of our love even if we dont believe that its god who is helping us i still think that its good to acknowledge that theres a force between the two of us thats helping us out

8247256 we dont have proof of dry county being formally banned what we do know that is the industry here in north america is small and when there appears to be momentum brewing dry county have always had the carpet pulled from under them now the band is snubbing the industry and going through the backdoor looking towards corporations lifestyle branding advertising opportunities and the internet to get their music heard which is a strategy that most independent bands should be doing
8247257 what the hells really going on these dayswho called for the no balls radio crazei dont turn the damn thing on much anymore
8247258 on saturday 9 august 2008 dry county finally broke from the shackles and muzzles of the music industry to have their cult single waitin on hank debut as an entrance song for super heavyweight ufc fighter the texas crazy horse heath herring millions of mma fans from around the world mixed martial arts a full contact combat sport finally got the chance to hear what many call a rant against the industry the song waitin on hank and its infamous chorus line you dont pee with the puppies and crap in the big dogs yard the song waitin on hank is somewhat controversial because of its non radio friendly lyrics but more so because its a shot against the industry its message resonates with many independent artists who similarly face the same struggles and challenges

8247277 the zimbabwe censorship board has not come up with any spelt guidelines as to what we should sing or not what they have done is to let broadcasters decide what they want played and what they do not want played this has left the zbh with a monopoly to blacklist songs it sees as politically incorrect

8247282 senator cornyn has been a tireless advocate for veterans and we will continue to move forward in providing the best services we can from health care to benefits for our brave men and women who served so honorably

8247287 this is an extraordinary example of a creative shift in thinking that truly places new zealand in the twenty first century
8247288 insulating all houses and reducing fuel poverty by compensating residential electricity users for raised prices should lead to evident health benefits for all new zealanders
8247289 the present poor energy efficiency of our houses in new zealand has had serious public health consequences
8247290 many of our homes were built in the late 19th century and the early part of the 20th when energy seemed so cheap we just used lots of it with the certainty of climate change we dont have the luxury of doing that any more
8247291 this political deal is an example of rational policy making at its best it puts in place a policy which deals with bad environmental consequences of energy inefficient houses by insulating them which has been repeatedly shown to be the most cost effective policy for reducing climate change

8247297 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chap stick i kissed a girl just to try it hope my boyfriend dont mind it
8247298 this song reflects the kind of relationship and behaviour that is common in western societies and that can also be found as a new phenomenon in arab culture of course we refute such ideas and songs but at the same time we cannot avoid them we must ensure our youngsters concentrate on their education with the help of their families teachers and lecturers to protect them from imitating other western cultures united arab emirates society is so open these days and great pressure is placed on the countrys decision makers such as the ministry of education to preserve our national identity
8247299 weve listened to the song but have so far decided against playing it because we realise the lyrics are quite sensitive to local culture and could offend some of our listeners
8247300 i think there should be some sort of social responsibility in the media to stop such ridiculous songs from being played
8247301 i havent heard this song yet but thanks for the censors i will download the song and promote for it myself
8247302 i believe this song does contravene the islamic culture and radio and tv stations should be more sensitive i heard this song last night on the radio and it occurred to me it was very controversial and wondered why they were playing it
8247303 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
8247304 im sure they opt out of singing i kiss a girl or ur so gay but theyre singing along to every other song
8247305 were going to have to do some forensics these are very complicated systems
8247306 we have made very clear that we were awaiting a verification mechanism that could assure the accuracy of the statements that north korea made in its declaration
8247307 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8247308 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8247309 what is going on here is one of two possibilities either they have not been bargaining in good faith and have no intention of giving up their nuclear weapons or they are just trying to negotiate the best bargain they can
8247310 we have cities that have been up three months in a row including boston
8247311 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation of price declines at the national level

8247315 in many muslim communities there is virtually no support for young women who want to express themselves as creative artists many muslim women are actively discouraged from expressing their thoughts and dreams through music a big part of the problem is the cultural expectations placed upon women there is the association of music with sexuality and a westernised form of expression the main aim i had in putting together the sisterhood project was to let young muslim girls know they are not alone in their struggles to get their music out there
8247316 this is just the first small step towards encouraging these artists and others like them out there to pursue their dreams and hopes and a way to let them know they are not alone female muslim artists face a tough time theres very little support for them but they are not alone as this first collection proves they have something to say and they deserve to be heard hopefully we can help create a platform to have their voices and opinions heard as both artists and muslim women living in western societies
8247317 i wanted to give these young women the support and encouragement i never had as ive had to learn myself no one will do anything for us which is why we have to help each other and create the change ourselves i dont want these women feeling the same isolation and difficulties i had to through the years simply because of my background and choice of career which is why it was essential for me to create this project in an attempt to build a sense of community and a network of support for my fellow sisters and artists my aim is to continue supporting and working with up and coming female artists as well as doing what i can to promote the right to freedom of choice and expression
8247318 this is because in my culture music is considered an unacceptable career choice
8247319 the ataraxis album was a wonderful creative outlet for me something i desperately needed to do for my own peace of mind

8247363 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
8247364 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
8247365 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

8247646 she was fabulous nothing less than i expected its hard to sit here and think about she would have accomplished were not stupid were not going to vote for john mccain
8247647 it will take a congress as well as a president thats what i can do and be true to who i am
8247648 a lot of us loved campaigning for her and its hard to watch it end but after something like this you have to have an emotional end for people to come to terms with things
8247649 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8247650 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly

8247686 confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8247687 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8247688 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8247689 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq
8247690 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome

8247698 patients taking cymbalta experienced reduced chronic low back pain in new study
8247699 anti depressant drug shown to help people with low back pain
8247700 eli lillys cymbalta is fast adding indications today the company announced it was approved for back pain and last week it was approved in europe for generalized anxiety disorder
8247701 eli lillys cymbalta is fast adding indications today the company announced the results of a trial to see if the drug can be used for back pain and last week it was approved in europe for generalized anxiety disorder
8247702 last year one academic paper found lillys claims of pain reduction in depression via cymbalta treatment to be overstated and quite small in reality an 11 5 percent effect size across several trials
8247703 but the fda has already approved the drug for use in treating diabetic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia
8247704 and if this new study is part of lillys application for chronic pain and i bet it is then id really like to see lilly put cymbalta up against medical marijuana which is approved for chronic pain treatment and reportedly works pretty well in several states bet the feds never let that trial happen

8247749 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane

8247762 i think she did what she had to do but i didnt feel any enthusiasm
8247763 what it did was it reminded us how incredibly strong a candidate she still is on that stage
8247764 but hillarys speech reminded me that im not a republican and im not excited about voting republican tonight reminded me that i am still a democrat at heart

8247770 youre not going to undo a months long primary campaign with one speech but its a beginning
8247771 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8247772 but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8247788 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8247789 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8247790 i read a quote from donald mcvicar today that i was mischief making again thats a slight on my character

8247800 we are working to create an organization that can best adapt itself to working with the interagency with our international partners and even with the private public sector
8247801 and we want to do it in a way that is completely supportive of all our partners
8247802 if i would put one word on it its partnership
8247803 that is our southcom motto partnership for the americas and our objective is to become the best possible international interagency partner we can be
8247804 i think you in many ways represent the face of the future with respect to our combatant commands
8247805 you may be leading what we are doing in our government
8247806 the united states needs organizing structures that are custom made for the age we live in not where we have come from
8247807 we in the federal government need to be organized so we can build and put together solutions to 21st century security challenges because they are not the same challenges we had in the 20th century
8247808 previous southcom commanders have recognized we need to fundamentally change how we do business around here
8247809 our philosophy from the beginning was to say this is about rethinking southcom and rethinking what a combatant command is
8247810 so we are first cousins with africom no doubt about it
8247811 the end state we and africom are aiming for is really the same end state philosophically
8247812 our staffs are talking constantly and we are indeed sharing lessons back and forth
8247813 we are trying to do some very similar things and it all goes back to partnership
8247814 we have the same end state but our paths to get there are very different
8247815 africom was a top down initiative that started with a presidential directive ours was a grassroots bottom up effort it started down here where we did some things internally studied it then ultimately the commander took it forward
8247816 africom has an initiation challenge and we have a transformation challenge
8247817 i wont say that one is easier or harder than the other they are just different
8247818 you need to have all these folks working together and cooperating you have to build a coalition of the willing
8247819 and thats the way they work today it is truly remarkable
8247820 our focus has broadened to maintaining security building and increasing stability and setting the conditions for prosperity in the region
8247821 were in the refinement phase right now and will call our provisional reorganization complete by the end of the fiscal year
8247822 yes we believe the new structures will better enable us to work together in new ways to address the security challenges we have
8247823 my job is to try to build an organization that is appropriate for the world to the south
8247824 i think we have done that and i think we will continue to work very hard doing that and ill let others draw appropriate lessons
8247825 we are working very hard to make sure we answer everyones questions and do everything within the boundaries of policy and law and do it with full transparency
8247826 the bottom line is that what we are doing here makes sense
8247827 we want to be a shaper of ideas helping build partnerships between actors that dont traditionally work together all focused on a common purpose

8247840 efforts to engage the military regime would be more productive if aung san suu kyi was left off the agenda
8247841 as the leader of a country he should not give such comments about the political affairs of other countries

8247848 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognize that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity

8247893 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8247894 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8247895 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8247896 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8247897 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8247898 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8247899 si no fuera por la adicci n a la nicotina la gente har a cualquier otra cosa menos fumar podr a dejar el cigarrillo espont neamente con s lo desearlo
8247900 si se quiere resolver el problema del tabaquismo hay que eliminar la adicci n hay que trabajar sobre los efectos de la nicotina
8247901 todas las vacunas probadas hasta ahora son seguras y bien toleradas sin efectos adversos
8247902 la vacuna servir para prevenir o eliminar la adicci n al quitarle el factor placer a la nicotina evitar que la persona que empieza a fumar se vuelva adicta
8247903 el cigarrillo es la jeringa sucia que nos mata pero la responsable de la adicci n es la nicotina si dejara de hacer efecto el fumador podr a dejar de fumar espont neamente
8247904 la nicotina no es totalmente inocua pero su da o radica en hacernos dependientes neurol gicamente del cigarrillo
8247905 el proceso es similar al de las vacunas contra los virus estas mol culas se parecen a la nicotina lo suficiente como para enga ar al sistema inmune y producir anticuerpos contra ella
8247906 los anticuerpos son prote nas que defienden al organismo uni ndose a sustancias reconocidas como extra as o da inas evitando que permanezcan en la sangre
8247907 se estima que ser til para que los fumadores en proceso de dejar eviten las reca das lo que no se sabe es si servir n para impedir los anhelos intensos de fumar que aparecen en los fumadores pesados

8247909 we dont have any indication that the russians plan to move away from agreements like the start treaty or moscow treaty or the inf agreement
8247910 and i think that would have obvious implications not only for the united states relationship but for relations with a lot of other countries
8247911 occurred even in the toughest times of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union
8247912 russia is not the soviet union but nonetheless i think we would still want to have a dialogue have an ongoing conversation with the russian government about strategic security issues
8247913 expressed strong interest in a new treaty as a follow on to the start agreement which expires next year
8247914 we in the united states have an interest in pursuing that we remain interested in negotiating such an agreement with the russians he said
8247915 i dont think that has changed and also i would hasten to add what we have said is that we are not going to conduct business as usual with russia

8247924 we found 38 per cent of mature men and 29 per cent of mature women were having sex more than once a week

8247927 theyre more likely to be at home with their loved one in front of the fire so in that respect its quite impressive

8247936 i signed up because i cant sit at home and watch americans dying and i want my kids to be proud of me one day
8247937 we pride ourselves on being charged for such a large scale national project of strategic importance as it was always the case we will work hard to deserve this confidence in our company in order to attain the result befitting our country for 45 years we have introduced many firsts to the automotive industry we have designed the first military armoured vehicle and we realised export of armoured vehicles for the first time since 21 years we are operating in the defence industry 25 thousand military vehicles we produced are being used by armed forces of more than 15 countries primarily by the turkish armed forces and un duty units in several regions of the world with altay project we will break new ground
8247938 it is certain that this project will bring enormous acceleration to the land platform development and production field of the defence industry in order to become leader in its region turkey requires stable government growing economy and strong armed forces considering the prevailing threats and contemporary battle area conditions it becomes evident that modern equipment tools and devices which of hi tech products and capable to dispose of potential threats must be available further to manpower in order to have contemporary and strong armed forces we have to develop its own resources and capabilities and to develop our own technology also in this field only in this way we can cope with the modern era and attain sustainable growth in the national industry

8247941 the mission of the acf is to ensure the best possible airplane is delivered to the u s air force
8247942 we just dont fly the jet we use this opportunity to ensure that the air force is receiving a safe properly modified mission capable airplane
8247943 we perform a detailed review of the contractors records ensuring all the requirements have been met
8247944 the acf crew then completes detailed ground and flight functional checks
8247945 the reserve is overseeing the program at dover so it can free up the active force for the global war on terrorism
8247946 by taking it over it reduced some of the stress on them and freed up their personnel
8247947 only the top 05 percent of c 5 flight crewmembers are considered for this job
8247948 the training is very extensive and specialized because flight members must have an indepth knowledge of c 5 systems and components and must fly in unusual conditions while performing functional flight checks
8247949 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8247950 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8247951 none of the six party talks joint statements however commits the us to any deadline for removing north korea from the list
8247952 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8247953 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites
8247954 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the bush administration
8247955 i dont think the bush administration will cave in on this

8247959 the georgian football federation have provided us with an alternative venue in case the match has to be moved out of georgia
8247960 they were given until tuesday to provide that alternative venue which is karlsruhe in germany
8247961 now there is a meeting of the board of the organising committee of the fifa world cup when they will decide whether the match should be played in karlsruhe or in tbilisi or wherever
8247962 so far its really good i dont mind being searched it doesnt bother me at all

8247979 the before you die element risks being a vulgarism implying that knowledge should be consumed voraciously however i took the view that putting these buildings together in a list would implicitly reveal their comparative strengths and weaknesses
8247980 it derives from the arabic classic the 1 001 nights and implies the endless potential of storytelling as well as the absurdity of limiting the knowable
8247981 its not the number of things you do in life
8247982 if you do one thing really well then that can make a life finding a cure for cancer for example is one thing but a very good thing that would be the advice of the greek philosophers
8247983 the risk of having 100 things to do can become a distraction and you only skate across the surface they become 100 distractions rather than 100 things lived for
8247984 its an implicit critique of consumerism that life is lived by consuming more rather than living well

8248001 the current forecast puts the central or western gulf coast in the path of gustav during the middle of next week the greatest threat for gustav to make landfall at this time lies between houston and new orleans
8248002 this will be the first election in 10 12 15 years where all the seats are in play
8248003 that is our mission democrats let us elect barack obama and joe biden
8248004 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8248005 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8248006 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8248007 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
8248008 i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day and think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation
8248009 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8248010 we are here to make sure veterans issues are at the forefront of the national political dialog
8248011 were not for or against the war were not trying to get anybody elected were simply trying to take care of those veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan
8248012 i know of a west point grad who suffered through several ied attacks
8248013 and although he was never wounded when we came back he was suffering from memory loss and losing the sense of smell and when he went to the va they told him you got a concussion when you were playing football at west point and they denied him his health care
8248014 were here to engage delegates and others to talk about what we saw and why we remain committed to victory in iraq
8248015 we recognize the success and gains that have been made not just militarily but politically its about sharing our perspective which we believe is underrepresented here
8248016 mccain has made it very clear that he wants to make sure that the gains weve made are not squandered
8248017 what bothers me when we talk about veterans on this side of the aisle its always about victimization we can talk about ptsd or traumatic brain injuries without suggesting that these folks had nothing better to do with their lives its offensive
8248018 i think theres a lot more common ground with the clinton supporters because she was tougher on national security issues
8248019 biden to his credit has had a bit more responsible take on iraq
8248020 some republicans say obama cant lead because he has not served a day in uniform
8248021 one of the marine corps principles is know your troops and look after their welfare i think barack obamas service in the neighborhoods of chicago translates perfectly to the service he would be able to give as commander in chief
8248022 while its true that republicans tend to claim the support of the troops there are many troops and veterans around the country who are ready for a change in leadership that looks out for them first
8248023 i think the biggest distinction between the two candidates is that barack obama respects the troops
8248024 he wants to give them a plan to win in the long term and not focus on continuing the policies that have failed to produce any lasting peace in iraq or afghanistan weve had some success but we need a plan not just more of the same
8248025 were not doing this for ourselves none of us want a job out of this
8248026 were in this because we know this is the most important thing for the united states and our national security
8248027 i guess there was nothing peculiar about it as a building it was beautiful because it was impressive spires and latticework jutting balconies arched windows it was just so completely out of place
8248028 we are making broadcast history executing the creation management and distribution of digital video in a way thats never been achieved before

8248047 a form of censorship one particularly commonly used against people such as aborigines
8248048 your attacks seem to seek to silence rather than to seek to change opinions sometimes you seem to seek to do this simply by belittling people
8248049 you seem to have become a little confused if not actually dishonest in your rancorous diatribes or drunken ravings directed at me
8248050 i rest my case on the evidence of your own pen right here in this statement
8248051 indigenous people should validly have even greater aspirations and expectations too but part of the deal requires them to mentally physically intellectually politically socially and spiritually move on as all of the rest of australian society in tandem should

8248058 spirituality is far more about how we approach both the present and future
8248059 it is all to often the racism and clash of cultures engendered by religious belief that leads to genocide and repression
8248060 it is long time since we too should have learnt to abandon the spiritual hogwash we have carried with us as baggage since the days of the ancient egyptians
8248061 oh it is so easy to effectively dismiss indigenous peoples with panderings to an archaic culture and encouragement of dot paintings and rainbow serpent stories but what about assisting them to become lawyers and doctors and scientists and politicians sitting in canberra how about assisting them to study at university to do business studies so that they too can run large corporations
8248062 spirituality is far more about how we approach both the present and future
8248063 we should have learnt to abandon the spiritual hogwash we have carried with us since the days of the ancient egyptians
8248064 at the 2008 garma festival of traditional culture the nationally significant key forum will explore the cultural environmental and economic importance of indigenous knowledge and the many benefits and opportunities emanating from the nurturing preservation and use of that knowledge
8248065 traditional aboriginal owners had the right to exclude fishermen and others from tidal waters within
8248066 they are not affected by a decision which relates only to coastal waters so most of the indigenous peoples of australia are still at risk of dispossession and disenfranchisement
8248067 european incursion destroyed most of their world i think we owe it to what we have inherited to treat their remaining descendants as people equal to and like ourselves for that is what they are

8248073 interesting to read about your huguenot roots phildeerhound well if you know the story you know the denial and repression and the subsequent conceitedly belated recognition of their existence by later generations ashamed of their butchery and inhumanity but the question is whether the europeans thought themselves more clever in killing each other as they again did in the 1900s than the colonial oppression which profited them so handsomely beforehand europes weath was all stolen from foreign lands
8248074 irrespective of how we arrived at present divisive social circumstance putting all blame aside and even all questions of guilt and innocence how do we set about creating a more sharing and egalitarian society in which beliefs are respected but in which no particular spiritual belief is allowed to predominate
8248075 some imaginary concept of a creation of which we are all part and that we thus share some common bond and origins
8248076 uranium is so common that it is to be found all over aboriginal land and is a cause for their attempted dispossession
8248077 im not one of those jugglers who tries to throw a chainsaw a bowling ball and a live chicken but its more like juggling gold nuggets they are heavy but uniform size and incredibly valuable to the readers and the company
8248078 i think its a powerful demonstration of what a massive population with a central government can accomplish with but i still prefer the individualistic accomplishments that you see on the sports fields the volleyball courts and the running tracks
8248079 a lot of guys turn to ikea catalogs when they look for new information and we aim to change that but after this next issue coming out in december were not making any promises

8248096 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8248097 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8248098 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8248099 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8248100 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8248101 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8248102 put immigration the commonwealth and the legacy of the empire into a clear historical context this can help pupils prepare for life in a diverse and multi ethnic society
8248103 indoctrinate white children with feelings of guilt over slavery in order to justify flooding britain with masses of third world immigrants
8248104 just be about slavery it is about the contribution that black and asian people have made throughout history
8248105 in addition we will soon be producing a definitive history of the arab muslim slave trade which dwarfed the european slave trade upon which the anti white government wishes to focus
8248106 we hear endlessly about the atlantic slave trade and whites are told to feel guilty about that but the truth is that the muslim slave trade was far bigger ran for far longer and was much more important than the european slave trade
8248107 isnt it strange how when non whites enslave each other and europeans no one says a word but when whites enslave others it is reason for a 200 year later fake guilt trip this is absurd nonsense and we reject it utterly
8248108 slavery was an evil which was abolished by the british government who then sought to suppress it elsewhere in the world
8248109 muslim slavery took place in west asia north africa east africa and certain parts of europe such as sicily iberia and england by the barbary pirates
8248110 in the early days of the first large islamic state during the 8th and 9th centuries most of the slaves were eastern europeans called saqaliba people from surrounding mediterranean areas peoples from the caucasus mountain regions such as georgia and armenia as well as black africans
8248111 between 11 and 18 million black africans were enslaved by muslims and sold across the red sea indian ocean and sahara desert during the great muslim slave trading time which ran from 650 ad to 1900 ad this easily dwarfed in both time and numbers any africans brought to the americas in the atlantic slave trade yet i dont see the government trying to make muslims feel guilty for these actions
8248112 in addition to the special downloadable articles we will be producing we are also working on a euro centric homeschooling curriculum which people will be able to use to counter the anti white propaganda coming from the government
8248113 bnp launches white history project to counter states forced black history at schools
8248114 in addition to the special downloadable articles we will be producing we are also working on a euro centric homeschooling curriculum which people will be able to use to counter the anti white propaganda coming from the government
8248115 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8248116 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8248117 this is the kind of question that i predict and this hsteeleas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8248125 we have looked at what the government requires at gatwick
8248126 nothing is set in stone and we are looking to receive all consultations by 4 september with a final report out in october
8248127 it is the view of west sussex county council that this approach makes no sense and will leave gatwick unfit for purpose for the olympic period and beyond

8248137 tombs are more splendid than houses of the living and old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons
8248138 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8248139 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8248140 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8248141 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
8248142 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8248143 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8248144 she knew he was running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
8248145 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
8248146 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
8248147 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
8248148 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
8248149 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
8248150 ini masih kita dalami apakah peristiwa pembunuhan itu benar terjadi namun salah mengidentifikasi korbannya atau peristiwa pembunuhan itu tidak terjadi tapi ada pelaku lain ini yang kita alami bersama sama
8248151 ketika jenazah ditemukan polres jombang memanggil keluarga korban dan yang hadir saat itu ibu bapak dan kakaknya mereka menyatakan bahwa jenazah itu adalah asrori setelah dilihat dari ciri ciri korban seperti adanya bekas luka bakar knalpot pada kaki giginya gingsul dan ada kesamaan pada rambut dan kuku

8248157 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
8248158 it will be alleged that through exhaustive inquiries by detectives a possible person of interest was identified
8248159 quite possibly he is the most unqualified ignorant and foolish candidate ever to run for office
8248160 he talks about the importance of education but he himself is so undereducated that its near impossible to follow his meanderings on his web site if his writing skills are any indication he never finished grade school
8248161 i really dont like to beat up on guys and hes probably a really nice guy and i am not beating him up because his views are different than mine
8248162 im writing this because he needs to get a clue
8248163 a lot of young women a lot of young mothers are looking to the military because they cant get insurance for their family because they dont have a way to further their education to get a living wage and a good successful career
8248164 we were able to start training last monday and we were able to get away from the distractions on campus for a while in spring lake
8248165 we are a veteran team with five seniors but we have seven new athletes so our trip was a chance for us to bond and rely on each other in competitive situations
8248166 our seniors are tremendous leaders on and off the course
8248167 we are also expecting some of our younger runners to step up i think two people who are going to be surprises this year are sarah squires and raeanne lohner both looked great on the track last year
8248168 we have a lot of people returning and only a few spots in the lineup everyone is going to push each other to get better
8248169 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8248170 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8248171 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8248172 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8248173 id like to see obama address that say that voice is no longer welcome
8248174 i certainly didnt feel used obviously politics is politics i dont want to be naive i also dont want to be cynical
8248175 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8248176 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8248177 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion
8248178 if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
8248179 crimes against life is it any wonder that criminality in general thrives and seeks to take advantage of the coarsening and darkening of conscience
8248180 i earnestly call on all catholics in my diocese to support politicians who are opposed to abortion euthanasia research on embryonic human beings
8248181 cscript nologo libparam js debug bla bla key value verbose

8248183 the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
8248184 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
8248185 the claims and influence of secularism and relativism have gone largely unchallenged in irish culture and media it could be argued that they enjoy an uncritical acceptance which would never be afforded to religious faith
8248186 as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
8248187 being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges such as for example the right to employ people who support the ethos of a christian institution
8248188 people of religious faith who may be natural enthusiasts of the concept of a european union increasingly approach european developments with scepticism
8248189 they have an expectation that a secular relativist and utilitarian approach dominates ethical considerations
8248190 journalists might look into pre kindergarten programs or elementary schools in their area that are using the core knowledge approach are the kids bored do their heads hurt
8248191 last season was highly embarrassing and we mentioned it before the game but the important thing is to play the way you can and we did that
8248192 it is important in cup ties when you play lower league opposition that you score early
8248193 that releases the pressure because the pressure is on you no matter what people say
8248194 we werent at our best and we have to give clyde a bit of credit but over the 90 minutes we deserved to win
8248195 dad when mum and uncle simon took me to egypt we saw wild camels in the desert near the pyramids
8248196 da ad you know who simon is hes mums um friend he comes to stay sometimes
8248197 i saw humpback whales off the coast of newfoundland on tv
8248198 i dont think wildlife vets operate on whales or marine mammals of that size at least not in their natural habitat
8248199 would you take me on holiday to see some whales one day
8248200 id really love to that would be quite a treat
8248201 im sorry about last weekend one of those friendships from childhood its difficult to say no to tim and family when they ask me over and they do that often since ive been on my own
8248202 not much that trip to wiltshire and work thats about it the gallerys busy at the moment
8248203 no not exactly im afraid were preparing for that show i told you about
8248204 he looks nice there you both do together and individually
8248205 he was nice his name was jasper like the stone
8248206 thats a strong name ive never met anyone with that name before there used to be that comedian on tv didnt there dont west country locals call wasps something similar
8248207 i dont know ive never heard them call them that he was a wasp though through and through
8248208 a white anglo saxon protestant you americans know a thing or two about them ive heard
8248209 do we im not sure ive lived here for far too long never had any contact with the church religion strikes the fear of god into me
8248210 me too particularly since he died we used to call his tumour gods gift it was a glioma one of the worst types you can get
8248211 it was a nightmarish eighteen months i wanted him at home till the end not in some grim hospital or hospice you get through these things somehow
8248212 im sorry to bring up the subject of your husband like this i didnt mean to pry
8248213 youre not prying i really dont mind talking about him hes not a taboo subject i dont have no go areas like you seem to
8248214 i dont have no go areas im just not ready to talk about some things they still hurt too much
8248215 id never push you to talk about things that make you uncomfortable im a good listener that comes with my job but i cant hear what you dont say
8248216 i promise youll be the first to hear if i have something to say about those things
8248217 youre one of the only people i could talk to about them tim tries to listen but doesnt really understand his marriage is fine and hes got two happy children hes never lost anyone important from his life
8248218 lucky him id like to meet him and his perfect family sometime
8248219 then well have to go to wiltshire together one weekend and visit them id like them to meet you too
8248220 i hope to be ready and that is certainly the plan i certainly did not want to create this dramatic announcement one way or the other every day you hope youre making progress you wake up the next morning and hope you still feel good
8248221 so far thats what weve been dealing with obviously you hope that still is the case throughout this week and going into next week
8248222 whenever you can see anybody whos been in the system be able to go out there and practice its a always a plus
8248223 especially with it being peyton who hasnt been able to practice with us all year during training camp its obviously big for us hopefully we can get him out there and getting him up top speed
8248224 ive been doing some things on my own its not like todays the first day ill be out there throwing or doing quarterback oriented things it will be the first time im out there with more than one receiver
8248225 we want to be limited were going to monitor him
8248226 we just cant let those guys step in and do everything
8248227 we have kind of a pitch count we do have a maximum on both of those guys
8248228 ive always been confident that he manning has been on track to start against chicago well see how that goes the one thing we wont do is we wont put him out there if hes not ready to go physically or mentally its a long season
8248229 he thinks hes going to be ready we feel like he will but if hes not well go to plan b
8248230 its probably not for me to answer what percent i am
8248231 we are to this point where i can get back out there and do some of the things involved with practice im glad this days finally here we just need to keep hopefully progressing as time goes forward
8248232 like weve said all along the goal is to be ready for the season opener and i certainly hope to be and at this point i expect to be
8248233 i saw where tom brady said he expects to be ready for their opener
8248234 i guess i have the same opinion i expect to be ready but you still need things to keep progressing at this point
8248235 because then if you come back and play they go man look how tough he is he came back after all that if you dont play they go well theres the reason
8248236 i think what has happened in the past is somewhat not as important right now because this is where we are now this is the significant step today for me to be out there on the practice field if things go as we hope they do and expect they do i definitely see myself practicing fulltime next week and playing against the bears on sunday
8248237 we know what hes capable of doing and vice versa
8248238 weve been doing it for a while him and wide receiver marv in harrison have been doing it since 1998 and this is my eighth year you get used to seeing him back there throwing it
8248239 it certainly is different than if it was a rookie or young players or a second year guy peyton knows our offense but its a matter of being out there and getting a rhythm with the receivers and the linemen everyone and making sure he feels comfortable and ready to go
8248240 so far so good he has been on track with everything the coaches have asked we have every reason to believe its going to gel but it is a little bit of uncharted water right now
8248241 all ive ever known is to be out there and take as many repetitions as i possibly could with these guys
8248242 i certainly did that this offseason i had a very productive offseason and a good offseason with our veteran guys as well as with our young guys
8248243 thats what my goal is to do is to try to be accurate throwing the ball and to feel good with my decision making and my timing this is the time we have to work with in order to try to get me feeling as comfortable as i possibly can
8248244 you hope the offseason program and some of the deposits youve had in the bank prior to the season and the offseason work ive done is going to help
8248245 but out of respect to the game and the quarterbacks who play this game you have to put your time in this is what i have left to do this is the time im allowed and i have to do whatever i can with it to get ready thats what i plan to do
8248246 this is what we have to do and this is the time that i have to get back out there and to practice with the guys its something we have to deal with and something we have to work through these next couple of weeks
8248247 da ad you know mum always brings me at exactly the same time
8248248 the man looked like a sad constipated dog treatment one teaspoon of cod liver oil in his food until symptoms are relieved

8248294 its been very positive this year because of the value of the dollar related to the euro the travel to new york has been exponentially up
8248295 our business is up as much as 50 percent over last year in new york and about 15 percent to 25 percent in the other cities
8248296 a little more and you might have had statistical significance
8248297 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8248298 its not like the voters have anything better to do
8248299 i believe that the book makes a very compelling case that religion is not responsible for war and that science is compatible with religion
8248300 the other way it enters the dialogue is by refocusing people on the real content of religion eighty five to 90 percent of religion is not about abstract ideas its about the way people live their lives and when people are in trouble or rejoicing or need community or are sick or have died suddenly religion steps in as that which supports and cares for them
8248301 thats exactly why you should never advance your children money to buy something or if you do at least hang on to the item until they come across with the cash

8248308 this failure may just be one of many other setbacks encountered in the largely successful 60 year effort to reduce trade barriers around the world but set against the growing sense of protectionism in both the developed and the developing world this failure carries an ominous tone
8248309 investors who already have plenty to worry about will need to cut long term growth expectations unless renewed efforts to reduce trade barriers restart
8248310 the problem is that this blip up in investment in public programs is not sustainable as economic growth slows and pressures on state budgets intensify
8248311 michaels body of work has changed the landscape for all documentary filmmakers
8248312 hes kicked open the doors hes broken the rules hes made clear that you can actually make a commercially viable documentary film
8248313 we dont bring movies to this festival that are mediocre or arent very good or it was a nice try or whatever
8248314 i think most documentary filmmakers nowadays are michael moore disciples
8248315 i thought oh my god this is great so fresh so original
8248316 there was no daily show back then no jon stewart
8248317 michael did things on camera no one was doing said things no one was saying i was determined to get a job on that show and by golly i did
8248318 our work with michael was always about exposing government and corporate accountability
8248319 this film shows how the government failed miserably but its also a story of how people can beat the odds and survive
8248320 those of us who work with michael believe in a lot of the same things the desire to look at things in a different way to look at issues that arent in the mainstream media
8248321 are ones that arise naturally as the result of telling good stories

8248323 i have used original kashmiri music in the film which has been recorded in kashmir i have used a lot of instruments like santoor rebab and tumbaknari and many kashmiri folk artists have also sung in the film i have tried improving this music without distorting the original essence and i hope that you will enjoy it
8248324 i feel that the background score composed by taufique in the film is fabulous it is very kashmiri and soothing to hear and you dont feel that an orchestra comprising 50 musicians is used to compose the music of the film tahaan it is very nice

8248340 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalized entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8248341 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8248342 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8248343 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8248344 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8248345 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8248346 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8248347 just like who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed

8248367 i hope he does well thats what we all wish
8248368 hes developed into a leader and has started to mature i think hes learned you earn respect you just dont get it at that position and he has done that hes earned it because hes worked at it hes studied and hes gotten through me getting on his case every day if you can get through that i think you can handle any crowd you go up against
8248369 i dont feel theres any extra pressure because ive been doing this since i was 7 years old
8248370 my dad has coached me up on what to do and coach rick christophel has been telling me what to do i just have to understand it and go out and do it
8248371 this is probably going to be the biggest crowd any of us have ever played in front of
8248372 this is an opportunity for us to go out there and have fun thats what weve got to do
8248373 were going to do everything we can to win the game and put nick in a position to make plays
8248374 nick has been an understudy the last couple years hes performed well in practice and we anticipate him having a great year hes very confident he studies tape a great deal he recognizes the change in his role as the starting quarterback i really appreciate how hes led our football team
8248375 im always going to do that im always going to prepare the second quarterback
8248376 you never know whats going to happen just like last year if you lose your first quarterback you better have someone prepared weve got to have a guy who can come off the bench if something happens

8248382 some are auditory learners while others are visual or tactile
8248383 but its important that they do their homework at the same place and at the same time each day so their body and brain know what to expect
8248384 dont multitask while you are trying to learn something new that you hope to remember
8248385 listening to music can energize people and increase alertness listening to music while performing certain tasks such as exercising can be helpful but tasks that distract you while you try to learn something new are likely to adversely affect your learning
8248386 you can tell in class the students who have studied theyre more prepared they have their binders open theyre raising their hands and asking questions and are more engaged
8248387 i had visions that gym class would be like military school but now i actually know its pretty fun

8248390 i have to study a lot in reading because last year i had low as
8248391 we make notes in it and highlight important stuff so that it pops
8248392 i will meet with some students recommended by teachers who are having trouble getting organized
8248393 middle school is a time for more involved projects and students can get really stressed
8248394 well use color codes and other approaches showing them how organization works they sign a contract and teachers and parents sign off on a card that work has been completed
8248395 every teacher in the building works with at least two students for intervention and the data is showing that it works
8248396 we kept records last year and our failure rate went down drastically
8248397 as far as the binder issue i never lost anything in the sixth grade i knew where to keep my papers my brother is in the sixth grade this year and hes asking me how to make it work
8248398 she added insult to injury by coming out tuesday night looking great in a blazing orange pantsuit
8248399 i think it is dangerous to confuse the idea of democracy with elections just because you have elections doesnt mean youre a democratic country
8248400 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision
8248401 beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them for then you will have no reward from your father who is in heaven
8248402 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8248403 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8248404 this is the kind of question that i predict and this heas sic nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8248409 to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools
8248410 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8248411 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8248412 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old lets talk about standing up for america today
8248413 mccains consultants are going to go out and make ads that are misleading about barack obama we are going to make sure that they are answered we have to make sure that the truth is out there and that we are answering with force

8248433 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july

8248435 while the vast majority of car mechanics and garages are entirely reputable our research highlights that there are a number of rogue tradesmen trying to exploit drivers and consumer confidence in the industry is low

8248442 consumers are in a lose lose situation where everything is shooting up except their income

8248444 we take a no compromise approach to investment and always look to invest in those areas that are most likely to get a return in this olympics weve exceeded all targets and expectations
8248445 theres been a significant injection of funds but the important thing as that its been spent intelligently its not gone on just the athletes but on support in areas such as sports science sports psychology and nutrition i think cycling is a great example of how weve invested wisely weve returned eight gold medals and had a medal target of six
8248446 weve far exceeded our medal target which has been fantastic but certain sports didnt achieve their medal targets and thats an area well be looking at going into 2012
8248447 the amount of money is still fractional in terms of government spending it makes up something like 1 of gdp it might even be as low as 0 5
8248448 were a nation that loves its sport and we believe that people think that elite success is worth spending on
8248449 olympic success can inspire a new generation of future olympians and creates positive role models who behave fairly and with dedication
8248450 the london 2012 games offers a great opportunity to continue the momentum weve got to put the network in place in terms of funding for facilities and the best coaching so that people who are inspired by sport stay in sport

8248485 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8248486 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8248487 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8248488 we need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of american confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity creativity and innovative spirit there are no limits to what is possible in america this wont be easy progress never is but it will be impossible if we dont fight to put a democrat in the white house
8248489 he obama knows government must be about we the people not we the favored few
8248490 john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years

8248492 i and the other hillary delegates represent millions of voters and its our responsibility to vote for hillary
8248493 thats what im pledged to do thats what i will do
8248494 the ultimate concern is definitely the several million voters maybe up to 4 to 5 million voters that she received during the primaries in pennsylvania and ohio west virginia many states voted for her and as of yet are not committing to obama her goal is to get as many as possible
8248495 frankly some of these reluctant democrats may end up becoming mccain democrats or simply walking away

8248541 the european union welcomes release of the two last political prisoners syarhei parsyukevich and andrei kim their release which follows the release of the five political prisoners in the beginning of the year and the release of alyaksandr kazulin mean that there are no more internationally recognized political prisoners
8248542 considerable step of belarus towards fulfilling commitments on observation of fundamental democratic values respect of human rights and rule of law
8248543 their release which follows the release of five political prisoners at the beginning of this year and more recently of mr kozulin means that there are no longer any prisoners in belarus internationally recognised as political prisoners this latest development could offer the union scope for a progressive resumption of dialogue with the belarusian authorities and the possibility of a review of the restrictive measures which it has adopted against belarus
8248544 steps forward should be followed by responsive steps the belarusian authorities have made a step they have released me parsyukevich and kazulin however the steps that have led to our release are not our full rehabilitation we continue to seek for our full rehabilitation and the rehabilitation of everyone who got sentences for protest actions of entrepreneurs in winter i think europe should take it into consideration
8248545 this film differs from others as we tried to discourse upon what could have happened if europe recognized independent belarus in the beginning of the 20th century this film is interesting in its resonating with the recent events in the caucasus

8248554 speaking about missile system deploying of missiles and a radar station in poland and the czech republic creates additional tension and we cant perceive it other than a threat to russia whatever the motives of the nato are
8248555 we are told some countries constitute a threat but its nonsense
8248556 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us

8248578 the best way to have a home that expresses a love for reading books is to share your home with a life partner who loves being a reader
8248579 suppose i love classical music what would happen if i have an intimate relationship with someone who hates classical music but loves heavy metal rock im into symphonies she collects metallica megadeath nine inch nails i wouldnt be able to take my partner to the concerts i enjoy or share the thrill of finding a great cd such a relationship would mean that i would have to give up a great deal of myself what kind of love is that and how long could we be happy

8248581 being a christian is very admirable and being a jew is equally admirable but being a jew for jesus combines things that are impossible to mix
8248582 if you think a lot about the holocaust about israel about torah wouldnt you be happier spending your life with someone who shared all this with you

8248591 our goal with the new jets stadium is to create the best home field in football and provide a range of seating options
8248592 we listened to our fans in designing this plan that is why we decided to have no psls in the entire upper bowl including those on the 50 yard line
8248593 you have to let it play out the jets or the giants dont have the answer to every algorithm or permutation out there
8248594 i dont think theres anything including super bowl iii that matches what the impact that this has
8248595 with the team with in florham park youve done everything you can do to put a winning team on the field we want to go as far as we can go in many ways this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy these seats

8248601 its hard to think the housing market wont recover eventually and that homebuilding stocks wont get back to profitability

8248603 if you look at them on a long term basis the homebuilders are great values
8248604 with sufficient access to capital and plenty of cash on the balance sheet
8248605 toll brothers has strengthened its balance sheet so much that the market knows its clearly a survivor

8248631 to say that you must see this is an understatement
8248632 extremely photogenic and a perfect background for that quintessential barcelona shot
8248633 having visited the sagrada fam lia and park g ell we wanted to visit one of gaud s houses too the only problem was which one to choose
8248634 the surface is not flat but curvy and functional objects like chimneys and ventilation shafts are given interesting shapes owls helmeted warriors and so on and textures broken pottery marble even broken champagne bottles

8248673 we reject any threat to the unity and sovereignty of lebanon especially from israel
8248674 tuesday we spoke with the israelis during defence minister ehud baraks visit to egypt and asked them to stop thinking about threatening this friendly arab country
8248675 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah

8248743 i think that signing the decree on recognition of independence of south ossetia and abkhazia by russian president dmitry medvedev is a very adequate and timely decision
8248744 all decent people must support russia in order to put an end to the unipolar influence of the us and eu in the world
8248745 russia cannot be reproached of anything have the us and the west forgotten how they recognized independence of kosovo bombed yugoslavia continue to bomb iraq have they forgotten afghanistan if i was in charge i would act the same on behalf of belarus as russian president have done
8248746 it is quite clear that russia has decided to stand up from its knees
8248747 it has said that it is a great state which is able to influence the geopolitical situation in the world notably it has started to act in the language of the us keeping in mind its own interests without looking back at possible discontent of other countries
8248748 that is why considering the logic of events the tactics of relations belarus must support the decision of russia to recognize independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8248749 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
8248750 and these figures only highlight the worst cases those that end up in hospital
8248751 whod want private sentiments to someone they loved revealed lawyers sent a warning she hopes it will work
8248752 actually i hate it im just trying to get it over with
8248753 republican and regional press didnt paid much attention to the election campaign for the
8248754 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have many times expressed support to their independence we understand that they have as right to decide their fate themselves after what has happened they addressed russia with the request to recognize their independence proceeding from the current situation a decision should be adopted considering the free expression of the will by nations the un statute osce documents i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia it is the only way to save human lives
8248755 we are planting a bomb for those we build houses without taking into account modern energy saving technologies
8248756 i do not think serious changes have taken place in politics of belarus
8248757 judging by todays facts global conclusions cannot be arrived at that something is changing in the policy of belarus towards its citizens and their freedoms i do not think that serious changes have taken place in the politics of belarus thank you for releasing a few persons but how many are still imprisoned how many abducted and others arrested are there one should look at the real meaning not at some details
8248758 two from four years were spent to come to a decision and we build a station in haste for the rest two years it was known five years ago that we need to build chp 5 the schedule was approved
8248759 in order there will be no questions to you the ministry of energy if
8248760 taupyanets you have been thinking for two and a half years the chinese malaysians russians or germans this is bad that is bad
8248761 a huge new type station into operation will allow to produce 450 megawatt of energy
8248762 according to the laws an irani company has won what come next
8248763 then you must build it if the chinese and iranians havent come take money and build
8248764 conservators who are very harsh to lukashenkas regime can come into power in lithuania in autumn
8248765 it is not the first statement we hear from vilnius me personally view these statements in connection with the upcoming parliamentary elections in lithuania which is to take place on october 12
8248766 thus the statement of the present speaker jur nas and other statements of his fellow party members and i should remind they are social democrats cannot have real influence on normalization of the regime which cannot reform itself i must emphasize
8248767 we will struggle for freedom of belarus until we win
8248768 we are thankful to all people of belarus who have struggled for our release
8248769 we will struggle for freedom of belarus until we win
8248770 the brest youth has been participating in the boycott campaign for some months
8248771 this three year term received by you is not enough for me if you wont withhold evidence your term will be longer and the situation will be worse for you
8248772 he arrived in his plane the number of the plane and other details are known we told about that to the russian ambassador in belarus the russian ambassador to the us he travels when he wants
8248773 i do not have information that boris berezovsky was in minsk i do not know that he was searched here either
8248774 the leaders of the unrecognized republics stated their desire to join the
8248775 we havent been warned that there is a dictatorship there
8248776 we were taking part in the electoral farce to the end
8248777 the eus position on belarus could be changed as we have seen new facts for instance release of political prisoners
8248778 it is high time for lithuania and other eu states to react the signals from belarus
8248779 change many things in the spheres of policy and economy with this neighbouring country
8248780 dear belarusians you have probable noticed that i publish open letters rarely only when i notice that your life and the belarusian state are in great danger
8248781 i am writing to you in the connection with the events in georgia and a lukashenkas project to sign new military agreements with russia in the time when the democratic world condemned the moscows aggression against georgia lukashenka met with putins associates not to defend the offended independent country but to congratulate the criminal authorities of the neighbouring empire on their beautiful aggression
8248782 i regret to see some of view believing the kremlins propaganda and take it as rights and fair instead of being indignant with estimation of the events in georgia
8248783 dont allow this agreement to come in force dont allow your country and lives to become a trade object for these hostile people a military agreement with moscow is a new seizure of our most important treasure the land of your ancestors your children and grandchildren our duty is to defend this land given by god to us i ask god you hear my voice in order you hear and understand how the current events are dangerous for your future russia revealed its real face in regard to georgia it showed that morality and human dignity mean nothing for it it attacked small georgia and in the same way it will use any opportunity or invent it to send its tanks to belarus in this case it wil be too late to defend it is now when we must defend ourselves
8248784 i have arrived here in the girls interests in order to inform her and the us family with the offers of our government it was in tanyas interests
8248785 we offer her to continue studies in belarus to get the school leaving certificate to take a thoughtful and adult decision as for her choice to stay in the us or to return to belarus
8248786 i love my motherland and my grandmother however my life there is hard and i have a family here
8248787 tanya is a part of our family we will help her no matter how difficult it would be
8248788 thousands and thousands of belarusian children received great advantages from holidays in the us so far
8248789 it happens and it never leads to a diplomatic crisis
8248790 isnt this excessive why is the government overreacting like this
8248791 to write your data in a notebook who are you and where you live
8248792 we always check passports according to our laws minors can be in the street only till 11 pm most clubs didnt perform this regulation people of all ages could attend them at night control has probably been tightened after some cases
8248793 there are some innovations as a customers journal it is said it can be connected with a threat we must record names of all visitors who use the internet of course it is not etiquette to ask to show a passport at daytime but terrorism is a thing that can happen by day too at home anywhere
8248794 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds
8248795 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the new phenomena his namesake telescope will discover

8248797 this camp is a kind of continuation to the last years cooperation with unesco
8248798 ohne einen erneuten preisschub am lmarkt d rfte der hochpunkt der teuerung vorerst hinter uns liegen auch wenn die nahrungsmittelpreise weiter kr ftig zulegen und der zugrundeliegende preisauftrieb wegen des st rkeren lohnanstiegs anziehen d rfte
8248799 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8248800 the government has put this re competition on a very tight schedule
8248801 what you see here is the improbability of conducting a major competition in record time
8248802 this delay means the pentagon is taking its time to do the right thing
8248803 so theyre seeing the rich customers slow down in payments slow down in purchases
8248804 but i pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing and incidentally it will get cured at some time in the future but right now the situation is getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
8248805 i dont think the intrinsic business value shrunk in fact i said i thought it probably increased a touch
8248806 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8248807 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8248808 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8248809 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaida and press russia to live up to its obligations
8248810 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war
8248811 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8248812 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8248813 i do not want to be part of a club that does not take care of or protect its players i do not know if i will go to
8248814 it would be best for everyone concerned because i know that my transfer would clearly be beneficial i do not want to cause any problems
8248815 thats exactly why you should never advance your children money to buy something or if you do at least hang on to the item until they come across with the cash
8248816 i tell her im not going to move till i get it
8248817 older kids have a lot more influence because theyre louder and in my face more
8248818 i can spend twice as much money because of what my daughter sees on tv
8248819 im glad my daughter is out of her green phase
8248820 when we disagree about a purchase we have a cooling off period and wait for a day
8248821 i wont buy lunchables when i can make the same food at home for less
8248822 the rupee opened stronger but went down towards 43 92 due to month end dollar demand from importers then state run banks came in and brought it up to 43 70 levels
8248823 technically it has the potential to test 43 50 in the near future
8248824 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8248825 the strong man john mitchell and the secrets of watergate
8248826 sen obama has repeatedly denounced the detestable crimes committed 40 years and has denounced his deplorable comments
8248827 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8248828 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8248829 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8248830 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8248831 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8248832 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8248833 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8248834 im not a big fan of the prosecutions charges but i think hes got some ethical issues that put a cloud over him
8248835 were probably not going to hear a lot about fiscal responsibility in the next 10 weeks
8248836 over time people are going to have to assume more personal responsibility for their own future except for those who are poor
8248837 media outlets reported allegations biden plagiarized kinnock but not that he had previously credited him
8248838 quit the 1988 presidential race in the face of accusations that he had plagiarized part of a speech from neil kinnock the british labor party leader at the time
8248839 shortly afterward he was found to have suffered two aneurysms
8248840 biden also will have his 1988 presidential campaign and the charges of plagiarism that drove him from the race resurrected at least in these opening days as he is introduced as obamas running mate but that experience is long in the past and probably does not present a significant problem
8248841 the main theme of warner was work together to solve problems
8248842 mccain has a long record of doing that barack obama doesnt
8248843 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8248844 i dont want a f king abortion clinic in my neighborhood
8248845 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8248846 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8248847 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8248848 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8248849 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8248850 gest o participativa situa o na qual no m nimo dois atores sociais negociam definem e garantem entre eles uma partilha equitativa das fun es os direitos e as responsabilidades de gest o de um territ rio uma rea ou um conjunto dado de recursos naturais

8248852 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8248853 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8248854 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8248855 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8248856 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8248857 uniquely qualified to nudge the country toward the color purple
8248858 four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home a disastrous foreign policy abroad four more years of the same divisive politics thats all about tearing people down instead of lifting the country up
8248859 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
8248860 the new law one of the most far reaching on housing in decades marks the centerpiece of washingtons efforts to address the nations housing meltdown
8248861 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8248862 im sorry but youll have to come back tomorrow when a more experienced optician can assist you
8248863 last season i was having a few problems with my hamstrings but this season touch wood i have not had any
8248864 i enjoy it most of the time when im not playing with jack because i know theres pressure on me to score
8248865 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8248866 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8248867 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8248868 it was a procession during which nothing happened except for that which should not have happened alonso retiring
8248869 it was a grand prix with much glamour but no safety car
8248870 i was actually surprised that it was a relatively boring race in which nothing really happened
8248871 in the other categories racing here we saw some really good racing with spectacular overtaking
8248872 slipped out of his hands and fell to the floor
8248873 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8248874 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8248875 nul ne dit que les religieuses ne peuvent pas tre belles
8248876 nous devons apporter un meilleur clairage sur le monde des religieuses qui souvent ne sont pas appr ci es leur juste valeur par la soci t
8248877 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8248878 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
8248879 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8248880 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8248881 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8248882 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8248883 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions she believes that can be done by making family planning more available as well as by increasing the number of comprehensive age appropriate sex education and caring adoption programs the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8248884 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
8248885 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8248886 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
8248887 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8248888 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8248889 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8248890 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case

8248903 por un lado preocup banme las tendencias proteccionistas de obama con respecto al libre comercio y por otro lado me causaban desaz n las posturas b licas de mccain las cuales no parecen ser buen indicio para detener el despilfarro pecuniario y moral de la naci n americana en irak

8248925 invasive species just one of the thousand signs weve learned so terribly after the fact to read salvinia molesta one of the worst it can smother a lake in days and under its proliferant injunction victoria chang surveys the paths that brought us here she charts her course through biosphere and boardroom the intimate spaces of private infidelity the vast terrains of state supported slaughter how is it in poems so keenly tuned to history and all its harms that the reader finds elation because in art this finely pitched we have the one true antidote
8248926 in the vivid lyrical world of victoria changs salvinia molesta a cardinal is a christ of little bones hummingbirds have tent stake noses and bullets make things beyond recognition and whether she is exploring the effects of the japanese rape of nanking the greed of corporate america or the complications of sexual desire she does so with a razor like sharpness that cuts through the skin of experience without disturbing the delicate mesmerizing and disturbing network of capillaries that feed its life this is a poetry of calm and unflinching exposure deft and precise

8248946 slavery by another name the re enslavement of black americans from the civil war to world war ii
8248947 brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in american history when a cynical new form of slavery was resurrected from the ashes of the civil war and re imposed on hundreds of thousands of african americans until the dawn of world war ii
8248948 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8248949 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8248950 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8248951 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8248952 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8248953 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8248954 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8248955 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8248956 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america

8248958 on giving the declaration of state sovereignty of the belarusian soviet socialist republic a status of a constitutional law
8248959 on ensuring political and economic independence of the belarusian soviet socialist republic
8248960 this low activity of candidates doesnt encourage voters to be interested in political campaign and visit polling stations
8248961 it is not enforced will but social and political development of the society
8248962 but we conduct election when we must hold it according to the election law not when the conditions are ready
8248963 we have analysed composition of commissions at other polling stations too
8248964 people who work at organisations that have no structural departments were made to nominate by gathering signatures as a result most commission consist of people working for the same organisation none of 28 representatives of democratic forces was included into commissions it means that the authorities hide something
8248965 during the meeting we spoke about the danger of recognition of the regime in its present form it would preserve and even worsen the situation in belarus most of the participants from the belarusian side noted the unshakable and principled position of the us in the issue of respect to human rights the us has played a key role in release of belarusian political prisoners
8248966 this trial is example of cynicism and treachery of the authorities
8248967 we cannot expect any major moves towards democratization until the policy of the regime towards mass media wont be changed
8248968 a thesis was announced that unfortunately belarusian mass media today cannot fulfill their constitutional function to collect and get through information to voters
8248969 the situation wont change crucially until the state run press exists which is forces to carry out a propagandistic function while the policy of economic discrimination is carried out against the independent press
8248970 this trial is example of cynicism and treachery of the authorities
8248971 i didnt expect this decision we presented good proofs to the court that show this case is fabricated it is an example of fraud cynicism and treachery of the current belarusian authorities
8248972 we asked for them to give us reasons of the judgement

8249091 senator mccain came to michigan and he told those who had been laid off he said well your jobs are gone and they are not coming back well i tell you what if hes president hes probably right if senator obama and joe biden are president and vice president we will create manufacturing jobs in this country
8249092 the question in this race is which of the candidates will make the change that will restore the promise of america is it john mccain
8249093 no im shocked maybe thats because john mccain continues to claim that president bushs policies have been great for the economy in 2007 john mccain voted with the administration 95 of the time
8249094 so if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous
8249095 could come as early as next week during the republican convention
8249096 there are no real jobs in the townships and theres no training
8249097 so people living there are stuck in this world where theres a lack of opportunities we wanted to give young people a future
8249098 a social entrepreneur sets up a business in order to make a positive change in the world
8249099 rather than maximising shareholder value a social entrepreneurs main aim is to use the power of business to address social or environmental issues and use the profits generated to further these goals
8249100 social enterprise has an added value in that it breaks the cycle of dependency to empower communities through business means there is a chance for real change
8249101 a central role to play in lifting people out of poverty

8249106 a retail campaign is an innovative way to make a huge range of positive impacts from waste reduction and socially motivated manufacturing to creating charitable feedback
8249107 good working conditions a fair wage diverse workforce and employee empowerment are the bedrock of the social enterprise business
8249108 all profits have to be re invested in the business and should the organisation cease then all assets must be invested in an organisation with a similar constitution
8249109 when it comes to social enterprises there are also at times challenges with accountability
8249110 it is relatively easy for a business to be accountable to its shareholders and it is relatively easy for charities to be accountable too they are there for the public good

8249122 one time i was doing a wedding and had just finished the brides makeup when she got an upsetting call from a family member moments before she was to walk down the aisle she hung up the phone grabbed a handful of tissues and proceeded to projectile tear into them i was sure she would remove the tissues and expose a beauty crime scene running mascara smeared eyeliner matted brows and eyeshadow removed in patches from all the saline the room was silent everyone was holding their breath waiting for the reveal when she brought the tissues down from her eyes not only was every stitch of makeup in place it all looked better than before it was blended more thoroughly than any finger or brush could ever achieve

8249151 what may frighten some americans about barack obama is his very excellence his fiercest critics have so far had little else to go on
8249152 but if he is truly that scary why is it so necessary to lie about him
8249153 if the real truth about him is so frightening why is it so necessary for someone like daniel pipes to ingeniously resuscitate the lie that obama is a muslim
8249154 if the actual facts are so damning why was it so necessary for fox and others to pump up the packet of hardbound fictions called obama nation a miserable book whose manipulative distribution propelled it to a debut at the top of the new york times best seller list
8249155 there will be those for whom race is the deciding issue but i believe their numbers are few for many more well meaning and tolerant people i believe the reason is fear it is fear of the unknown but not only fear of the unknown obama
8249156 i believe that the real fear is finding out what lies behind the big lies of george bush and more ominously by far dick cheney karl rove and a host of other neo con artists
8249157 this foreign visitor doesnt believe that this election is about race it is about the difficulty and the sacrifice involved in changing course acknowledging error actively working for a better common future
8249158 it is a battle over the kind of complacency and fear of change that put into the oval office its most underqualified occupant in living memory perhaps that is how the joke statistics should be understood and taken seriously

8249182 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8249183 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8249184 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8249185 i cant tell you how surreal a dream that is for me
8249186 i think of all the headaches and fires that i have to put out and the problems that i have which are all the necessary steps to acquire a billboard and the pressure of making sure this show better live up to that billboard but its the thing you wish for so how can you really ever complain

8249193 expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results

8249195 we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin

8249204 the point was really to introduce michelle to the public for the first time and let them see that she is very different from the caricatures displayed in the news
8249205 michelle is not a politician she is a mother and a wife and a working woman and a community organizer
8249206 he still has trouble putting the bread up and putting his socks actually in the dirty clothes and he still doesnt do a better job than our 5 year old daughter sasha making his bed so you have to forgive me if im a little stunned by this whole barack obama thing
8249207 for the first in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
8249208 the selfish part of her would say she wants him home for her children
8249209 but for the sake of her children she wants him to win this election
8249210 so i think theyre at a different point in their life now
8249211 but there is a sacrifice i dont want to underestimate that
8249212 after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

8249220 when i was growing up i felt the dragons were my family
8249221 but today the dragons are angry with us and see us as enemies
8249222 for us giving food to the dragons is an obligation our sacred duty
8249223 we dont want the komodo dragon to be domesticated its against natural balance
8249224 we have to keep this conservation area for the purpose of wildlife it is not for human beings
8249225 if we let the locals hunt again the dragons will be gone
8249226 if we are not strict in enforcing the ban everything here will be destroyed
8249227 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats
8249228 today its a goat and tomorrow it can be our child
8249229 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go
8249230 i dont blame the dragons for my boys death i blame those who forbade us from following custom and feeding them
8249231 if it werent for them my boy would still be alive
8249232 shouldnt have crouched like a prey species in a place where dragons live
8249233 youve got to be very careful about extrapolating and drawing any conclusions
8249234 any concern expressed by the villagers will be taken seriously and we will address it if we can
8249235 they play their music loud though so they want a condo thats soundproof
8249236 thats exactly why you should never advance your children money to buy something or if you do at least hang on to the item until they come across with the cash
8249237 i tell her im not going to move till i get it
8249238 older kids have a lot more influence because theyre louder and in my face more
8249239 i can spend twice as much money because of what my daughter sees on tv
8249240 im glad my daughter is out of her green phase

8249248 the problem is that this blip up in investment in public programs is not sustainable as economic growth slows and pressures on state budgets intensify
8249249 this failure may just be one of many other setbacks encountered in the largely successful 60 year effort to reduce trade barriers around the world but set against the growing sense of protectionism in both the developed and the developing world this failure carries an ominous tone
8249250 investors who already have plenty to worry about will need to cut long term growth expectations unless renewed efforts to reduce trade barriers restart

8249646 then when you put your shoe back on the laces are much tighter than the one on the other foot so the rest of your day is disrupted
8249647 but in the end you know you can never win and you eventually have to stop sometimes in the middle of a busy street or a shopping mall and take your shoe off

8249667 time is running out for me and there is no relief in sight and i have not eaten for days
8249668 we have enough stock of food grains but the problem is that we have limited means of transport to supply them among the villagers
8249669 we are having difficulty in getting the exact number of prisoners who fled since communication networks have totally snapped
8249670 they must understand that they are right in middle of the river and the monsoon season is still in progress
8249671 the weather has been extremely hot aggravating the suffering of the displaced population particularly for children pregnant and lactating women and the aged
8249672 with this aim in mind we will be ready to make decisions including in the united nations and the osce on additional increases in the number of international monitors clarifying their mandate and possibly other steps with international participation
8249673 we have no intention to keep peacekeeping forces outside the borders of the two regions in the buffer zone forever
8249674 but we will insist on arranging reliable international control over the bordering territories
8249675 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8249676 we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8249677 we need to re examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8249678 we started the process three months ago and so far we have registered about 10 500 palestinian refugees baghdad
8249679 our teams will soon head to the northern province of nineva and the southern province of basra to register other palestinian refugees another team will visit al walid camp inside iraqi territory on the border with syria
8249680 sign of the brotherhood of the iraqi people and its government
8249681 are still going through an acute humanitarian situation at the border camps
8249682 we highly appreciate the efforts by the iraqi government to offer us all the possible facilities to help us
8249683 they talked enough about what they had done and who had done it that the police were able to track it back to the three of them
8249684 all three of them confessed to being involved in the matter
8249685 what mr sestito could remember along with the nature of the injuries tended to suggest it had been a beating with fists and feet so we were satisfied that the two juveniles were telling the truth about who did the beating
8249686 a lot of motorcyclists have reservations about using a regular rest area on the interstate due to the fact of the large vehicles that are in there and it is very easy for them not to see you it is a cramped quarters and it is one of those places you are little bit apprehensive about using if you are a motorcyclist
8249687 and our area is very blessed to have a lot of traffic from motorcycles due to the parkway due to us being in the mountains and having a lot of virginia byways to ride on in this area it picks up the traffic for us which in turn gives us extra revenue dollars money that is spent in the area
8249688 the funding for it would be applied for through grants through several agencies throughout the state due to the simple fact that we are talking about promoting safety and increasing tourism dollars that is our whole goal
8249689 this would be the first of its kind in the nation and we would like to see it come to carroll county instead of somewhere else the other thing we thought was good was if we could get it located in an area within close proximity to places to eat and stay overnight and places to buy fuel so that it would help promote the whole area for us for bringing in more dollars to the county
8249690 we are trying to sell carroll county to the rest of the state and virtually to the rest of the country if you actually want to go motorcycling this is a great area to go
8249691 and with fuel costs the way they are right now you are seeing more and more motorcycle people taking trips and vacations on bikes so that is the whole reason that the program was first started
8249692 again we are just trying to take an opportunity to bring in money to the county any which way we can im not saying its the only way but its one of the ways if it will help generate some revenue which will end up helping our tax base which ends up helping the taxpayers in the county then hey i am all for it
8249693 i felt like if we had an area where people could take a break relax enjoy and it was in a high enough traffic area so they would feel safe then they were going to use it the more the location would be used the better it would help everybody that is around that area

8249696 it will not be a home for administration officials while republicans wait out the barack obama administration
8249697 the real problem with todays market is that the trust has been fractured
8249698 we know that other countries like venezuela and mexico also have problems with drug trafficking and kidnapping
8249699 whats becoming clear is the depth to which this activity has penetrated colombias institutions and the families who run them
8249700 these scandals showing ties between crime groups and the state solidify opposition to the trade pact in washington
8249701 put x of this and x of that and press combine
8249702 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8249703 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8249704 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8249705 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8249706 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8249707 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8249708 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8249709 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8249710 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8249711 its a very powerful speech hes going to come out of this convention the way barack obama came out of the last convention as the rock star as the next guy
8249712 it was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength mccain wins but if this elections about the past versus the future republicans have a much tougher job

8249751 but its not going to be easy if it was id have won four or five times by now im sure that come sunday afternoon its going to be tight
8249752 with the quality of players in the mix it will not be a case of thinking that finishing 30th will be enough
8249753 i really battled last week and now im very close to something i really want
8249754 you learn a lot about yourself playing under this pressure i was really hoping to get the job done in the states earlier this month but its come down to this

8249756 all along ive said the ryder cup is not on my mind everybody harps on about it but im not thinking about it

8249770 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8249771 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8249772 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8249773 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8249774 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8249775 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8249776 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8249779 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8249780 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8249781 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8249784 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are

8249792 the biggest challenge facing a young journalist in todays media is
8249793 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8249794 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8249795 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
8249796 thats the thing that sticks with you even if she can move on easily thats not as easy for everybody else
8249797 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either
8249798 we love her but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
8249799 she was fabulous nothing less than i expected its hard to sit here and think about she would have accomplished were not stupid were not going to vote for john mccain
8249800 it will take a congress as well as a president thats what i can do and be true to who i am
8249801 ive had more contact from the mccain campaign since the nomination than from the obama campaign

8249804 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8249805 as you know in the recent budget we put considerably more inspectors and resources into this
8249806 obviously we want to make sure that the companies maintain their responsibilities and that we fully review all the facts here to understand what went wrong and how we can prevent it in the future
8249807 thousands of salesforce com customers are using the force com appexchange to extend saas applications throughout their enterprises
8249808 as critical sales opportunity information is captured within salesforce crm customers can now use springcms privia to seamlessly take advantage of this data in the proposal process while transferring status information back to the opportunity manager as needed the tight integration between springcm and salesforce crm will drive customer success through efficiency gains and improved information management in the proposal process
8249809 as anyone involved in responding to complex proposals knows the right opportunity information and automation of repetitive tasks are critical to increasing win rates
8249810 through tight integration with salesforce crm the latest version of privia is a part of our ongoing commitment to make the capture and proposal management process easier and more efficient for our customers while increasing the quality of proposals
8249811 we share much of our account and opportunity information between privia and salesforce crm
8249812 until the release of this automated data exchange capability from springcm we had to manually enter data into both systems while trying to ensure each system had the same up to date information this manual process was not only time consuming but also prone to errors now we can seamlessly exchange data between the two solutions which will help us save time and ensure consistent data we estimate we will save approximately eight hours per week with this new capability
8249813 there may ultimately be 30 different subtypes of image video sharing service half of which remain to be discovered
8249814 digital photo frames are a great idea but the current photo frames are pretty bad
8249815 it takes a lot of effort to get your pictures onto them were trying to let you push pictures directly to the frame so your non technical relatives can look at the frame and there they are
8249816 it must be emphasized moreover that the original complaint for the cancellation of the eccs of the small scale mining permits of pgmc has already been rendered moot and academic as these already expired last april 2008
8249817 thus there being no more valid and existing small scale mining permits the issue of the cancellation of the eccs of the permits regarding over extraction of minerals and other violations by pgmc is no longer necessary
8249818 we had special board meeting on this and we deliberated on the complaint of the other party pgmc regarding orientals prospectus the legal cases were disclosed in the prospectus and we found no reason to deny the application
8249819 a reading of the foregoing grounds reveals the intention of the lawmakers to make the registration and issuance of securities dependent to a certain extent on the merits of the securities themselves and of the issuer to be determined by the sec
8249820 this measure was meant to protect the interest of the investing public against fraudulent and worthless securities and the sec is mandated by law to safeguard these interests following the policies and rules therefore provided
8249821 the absolute reliance on the full disclosure method in the registration of securities is therefore untenable
8249822 they cannot really point their fingers to the company the situation right now is beyond the control of oriental public investors are unwarranted victims
8249823 for example they want to invest in other mining claims they can do that as long as they disclose it to the public we dont impose penalties on deviation but on non disclosure
8249824 i dont think the price of the stock would go anywhere until these are resolved
8249825 the public is very trusting maybe thats why they still bought oriental shares despite pending cases its because they trust that regulators examined the risks very well
8249826 now in cases like this the regulators may need to look at the requirements again be more observant of what the situation really is and lay down more stringent rules
8249827 the philippines needs to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country

8249830 the relationship that agodoa had with the hospital was only for orientation and further assessment which lasted from june 1997 to august 1998
8249831 the letter dated may 9 therefore requested the korle bu teaching hospital to organise a six month orientation and assessment for him at the department of medicine and surgery
8249832 if found to be satisfactory then a structured remedial training should be organised for him depending on his readiness to accept such corrections

8249844 any strategist with any sense understands its important to do well in the intermountain west
8249845 the intermountain west is not a bastion of liberals it tends to be centrist and it tends to be independent
8249846 i would rather sit in jail 100 years than bring harm to one civilian in iraq through an illegal war that is a gross misuse of american might
8249847 we just want to be here to show people that colorado is a battleground state and just because they have the dnc here its not a free pass for the democrats

8249849 i had a history professor who had a quote in his classroom stand up for what you believe in even if you stand alone
8249850 i tell them the same can be said for ross perot helping bill clinton win in 92
8249851 i was going to give the money to carbon offsets and that just got confusing
8249852 now what kind of question is that i dont care how many homes the man owns ask him something i care about like how many soldiers are in iraq how much money are we spending over there
8249853 that would have been perfect because then i could say shes getting the last laugh
8249854 thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the government house
8249855 i am begging to my fellow citizens to leave the government house and hold a rally somewhere else where police will have no objection to it
8249856 i dont want to call this an ultimatum more an appeal
8249857 more people will join us tomorrow dont leave or we will lose if we hold on we will win in the next three to four days
8249858 the pads last whistle blow is unjustified unnecessary provocative and illegal

8249868 while the boundaries of sovereign states are becoming symbolic in europe in other worlds regions sovereignty is being increasingly challenged and separatism sometimes leads to bloodshed and terrorism while these trends are contrasting they both suggest for a serious rethinking of the notion of self identification in a changing world however there are few options left for an individual if he is not taking an active part in political life we believe people should be offered a broader choice wirtland is the newest alternative for peoples self identification most importantly wirtland is a democratic friendly and peaceful alternative how influential is wirtland and when wirtland will become a real country it completely depends on the wirtlanders and their will to contribute to development of this country just like in any other democratic community our aim is to offer an appropriate structure a working mechanism hopefully an attractive one to allow for free discussions and all kinds of activities of our citizens and other interested people who can apply for becoming a wirtlander everyone
8249869 we started out as a couple of people intercepting baby kittens as they were being brought into a city shelter and have grown to where we can rescue rehabilitate and find homes for 1 000 cats and kittens every year

8249875 our opponents have been misrepresenting the facts about smart for years
8249876 they have done it at public meetings they have done it in letters to the editor they have done it with their own mailings
8249877 but now they are asking taxpayers to cover the cost of putting this stuff into the mailbox of every voter in the county and were asking the court to put a stop to it
8249878 this is a veiled attempt on the part of smart to keep the voters of marin from learning the truth
8249879 smart would not serve marins transit needs according to smarts own studies
8249880 when i read the anti q ballot argument i was amazed at how much they were distorting the truth it was filled with misinformation
8249881 i feel very strongly that the voters should vote based on the facts so i want to stop the opposition from being able to say things in the ballot argument that are just plain not true
8249882 passenger trains and freight trains up to 60 cars in length would run at all hours through novato terra linda and san rafael

8249884 perpetual taxation that would cover a fraction of the costs
8249885 the opposition cant say that the costs arent covered when they are
8249886 this is a blatant attempt to raise fear and doubt in the voters minds

8249898 there was no swearing or anything id been sitting on a towel and i threw it to the floor because i was so disgusted nothing else

8249901 we had enough chances to win five games no question about that we played well created so many chances which is great but once again i must point the finger at the boys who did not capitalise

8249921 we pitch the idea that were pragmatic rather than the latest and greatest we know how to operate a cloud really effectively by using tried and true tools and one of them is xen we showcase that were involved in the project and they would much rather have their applications in a stable environment than a supercharged always failing environment

8249927 i was like any business owner but we have to buy so many support contracts for clients servers hardware and you start to realize theyre not really interested in supporting you it used to be dell had this four hour support contract and it was easy to get them to do the work as time has gone on they have changed that we went to dell the other day and they wanted us to troubleshoot you have to go through all the troubleshooting before they will dispatch a part the more i see that the more i say i would rather rely on the community discussion boards its all right there and i can just get it rather than having to social engineer my way through tier one support
8249928 but we do get to see the net effect of all the software as it is running on diverse systems and we contribute back support we keep an active wiki and dump chunks of it back into the community to help the discussion sugar rolled out a revision recently and we saw the broken parts within minutes we let people know and many people avoided upgrading to that release were not stellar code contributors but we do play a role
8249929 the principal flexibility of open source is unlocked by being able to leverage many php or java developers to produce your vision
8249930 with a network company the advantage of open source is even clearer if you have a programmer you can string together an entire systems desk by using open source connectors that work together and that looks like a large network management company the advantage is i get the same efficiency as a enterprise grade product at much lower expense
8249931 a platform designed to make it easy for anyone for free to set up a page on a single topic he or she knows or cares a lot about
8249932 warchalking www warchalking org is a movement to mobilize the geek community to decide a standard iconography for public wi fi its been likened to the old hobo chalk code which subtly identified houses of friendly women with apple pie and cold hearted mayors with firearms but actually its more akin to what had to happen in the previous millennium in response to another emerging technology the day came when there were so many automobiles in private hands that society needed a common iconography to manage them
8249933 just bought a wifi card after finding that tallinn estonia has wireless access in most cafes hotels and even on the beach check out
8249934 i was trying to figure out how i could use my wireless capabilities to stay connected in london when i read about the kynance node and consume
8249935 im planning on warchalking the u of minnesotas twin cities campus as soon as i get my laptop and wireless connection only im going to print up some nice signage based off the pdf on your site

8249945 youve got wireless connectivity on your laptop great read about connecting to wireless networks and heres a card to help you identify where you can connect
8249946 i had a suggestion for the warchalking icons since most open aps have their ssids set to broadcast on beacon frames why not have a symbol in the ssid place to let people know that they can just pick the ssid out of the air this would take much less writing
8249947 hi there great idea for the warchalking bit kind of cool
8249948 just came across the site via the joy of tech comic

8249957 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8249958 i am here today as a proud mother a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud support of barack obama
8249959 i havent spent the past 35 years in thetrenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8249960 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8249961 but remember before we can keep going we have to get going by electing barack obama president
8249962 in 2001 the oil companies the war contractors and the neocon artists seized the economy and added 4 trillion of unproductive spending to the national debt trillions of dollars for an unnecessary war paid for with borrowed money
8249963 wake up america the insurance companies took over health care wake up america the pharmaceutical companies took over drug pricing wake up america the speculators took over wall street wake up america we went into iraq for oil
8249964 this administration can tap our phones but they can t tamper our creative spirit
8249965 they can open our mail but the can t open economic opportunities they can track our every move but they lost track of the economy while the cost of food gasoline and electricity skyrockets now they have skillfully played our post 9 11 fears and theyve allowed the few to profit at the expense of the many
8249966 since we installed wifi here at reinvented world hq in charlottetown a couple of weeks ago it seems only right to share what we have and pay a sort of techno homage to my grandfathers generation so witness our very own warchalking symbol pictured here its not made of chalk it rains too much here but the message is the same
8249967 i have to say i laughed for several minutes when i first heard of
8249968 i am also waiting for someone to put up chalkmarks on my driveway even if i did it myself i would probably have very few people hanging out as i live on rural street in suburban nyc however i can just imagine coming home one day to find a stranger on my patio with his or her laptop plugged into my outdoor outlet but here is an interesting thought obviously much has been said about the whole free vs paid network scenario but what about people who war chalk corporate nets take the following two situations warchalker a stumbles across an unsecured network run by xyz company someone from xyz company sees him marking up the street outside their building and has him arrested for technological trespassing granted one could argue that if the network were truly private it would be better secured but the company might still have a case wachalker b sees warchalker as markings with no indication as to whether the net is private or not he boots up and starts using it only to be caught by someone from xyz is he liable maybe i know that your initial intent was kiss keep it simple stupid but in addition to the paid network symbols of that people have been suggesting we might also need a symbol to indicate that access privileges are unknown as for the pay per use wi fi chalk marks i dont see the point starbucks in the us advertises their wireless connectivity like crazy other spots that have it would too courtesy of boingo t mobile joltage etc wasnt the whole point of the hobo markings a cryptic sign for those in the know to get a free meal hoboes wouldnt tag a restaurant if the food was good but you had to pay for it would they
8249969 first off i have to agree with those whove already chimed in to say that
8249970 in london today a gang war broke out over a territorial dispute
8249971 not only did this newbie drop in he launched a p2p flood
8249972 ive seen the discussions on slashdot and noted a few peoples conclusion jumping that this was meant exclusively for crackers to break into insecure networks and thus could hurt the open networks movement

8249982 see the transition not the physical transition on the discovery channel but the psychological spiritual social transition the impact on friends family and community
8249983 made clear once again why we condemned the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8249984 there are several u n security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of georgia was stressed which russia also worked on
8249985 i just made a visio for the warchalk symbol can you add it to your site
8249986 how about putting up a very lage pdf of the three main symbols the admin could post it in an office or apartment window and would give the wardriver stumbler an idea of how friendly he or the boss is to people borrowing bandwidth not all admins are too keen on the idea of others on their network even fewer will like the idea of being tagged without their knowledge consent give them the opportunity to let their wishes be know
8249987 somone should make a simple perl script and postscript template so that one could print out nice symbols like the ones in your warchalk pocketcard this would be nice for official looking signage inside buildings etc
8249988 a new fad in london is taking the internet community by storm chalking runes on pavements and walls to indicate the presence of a wireless networking node seventy years ago during the depression in the us hobos drew signs to indicate to each other where they could get a meal now across the atlantic in london geeks are talking about using a similar system of chalk symbols to signal where they can get a decent wireless internet connection
8249989 i am one of those people trying to seriously encourage community networking and if that activity is seen to be some sort of cracker plot it will be damaged
8249990 id like to see no alphanumerics at all in the symbol so anyone
8249991 wow really like the concept of your warchalking language i read some
8249992 thought id let yall know that you wont be the only people making chalk marks on walls and sidewalks this might get confusing if people arent paying attention in cities around the world there are groups of runners
8249993 do you know if anyone in the u s has started thinking about doing this
8249994 i think if someone like john mccain for example has very fair skin light eyes and a history of living in a place like arizona that is a darn good explanation for his skin cancers and he is healthy otherwise so the chances of his non melanoma skin cancers being a marker for other dna repair problems is slim in my opinion
8249995 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8249996 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8249997 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8249998 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8249999 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday
