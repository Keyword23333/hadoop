1530000 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1530001 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1530002 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1530003 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1530004 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1530005 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1530006 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1530007 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1530008 scientists warn australia will be hit hard by climate change with temperatures rising water more scarce and economists warn to protect our economy we must act now
1530009 were developing a carbon pollution reduction scheme to tackle climate change
1530010 when i think i spent 20 years of my life the first 20 trying to become something wanted to becomne good at things i wanted to be good at sport school grades and everything you could have viewed from that perspective i werent good the way i was but if i got good at things then realized i had the game wrong because the game was to find out what i already was
1530011 loose ends cant be tied up by a knot for even a knot has a start and an end which still leaves something loose on both sides of the knot burning the loose ends long enough so that they melt together removes the idea that the ends must be crossed over to create a knot july 1 2008
1530012 it was at a venue that we had just performed and you know it was a ridiculous situation that they will unfortunately make me pretty rich from and who knows second third fourth album might be on i gotcha records
1530013 la llegada de las fuerzas combinadas a esta localidad ha generado posturas encontradas entre los habitantes unos piden su retiro y otros dicen que es necesaria su presencia
1530014 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1530015 this would presumably indicate that the foot belongs to a new missing person
1530016 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1530017 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1530018 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1530019 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sherrifs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1530020 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately
1530021 in the last couple of years weve had these tsunamis where thousands of people have died you cant help but think is it related to the tsunamis
1530022 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the supp
1530023 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1530024 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
1530025 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
1530026 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
1530027 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
1530028 be happy when they drive such a car knowing it saves fuel and does not pollute
1530029 what is a negative emotion an emotion that is toxic to the body and interferes with its balance and harmonious functioning fear anxiety anger bearing a grudge sadness hatred or intense dislike jealousy envy all disrupt the energy flow through the body affect the heart the immune system digestion production of hormones and so on even mainstream medicine although it knows very little about how the ego operates yet is beginning to recognize the connection between negative emotional states and physical disease an emotion that does harm to the body also infects the people you come in contact with and indirectly through a process of chain reaction countless others you never meet there is a generic term for all negative emotions unhappiness

1530034 well see a 17 percent discount to spot in the next twoquarters and as we come into 2009 that discount will be reducedto 6 percent
1530035 marcha mundial de las mujeres respondiendo al vih y al sida

1530037 in a phrase this campaign will be about the people versus the powerful
1530038 mandatory sick leave is ultimately going to be bad especially for smaller businesses
1530039 if a business has to choose between the state of ohio and another state this may be a deciding factor that forces them to choose another city or another stage
1530040 if they have to do this it means they either have to lay people off or theyre going to have to change the pay structure or ultimately just change the benefit structure
1530041 every day thousands of middle class ohioans face a gut wrenching choice
1530042 take care of their sick child or spouse or lose their paycheck or even their job
1530043 that is getting people to stay home when theyre really sick
1530044 if its defined as personal time i think that employees would tend to find enough personal reasons to take seven more days
1530045 if its defined as sick time where you are unable to come to work either because youre ill or your immediate family is ill then i dont think it will affect us one way or the other
1530046 players are wary of new supply in jgb and treasuries marketsthis week with sentiment particularly hurt by expectations thecpi linked jgb auction will be weak as oil prices are falling
1530047 you have a company that used to post above the main line grocery stores posting more in line with grocery so i think thats suggesting a share shift
1530048 i dont think that it means its a permanent shift
1530049 prosecutors said police observed him eating pieces of his victim when they surrounded the bus on a desolate highway about 90 kilometers 55 miles west of winnipeg immediately following the july 30 attack
1530050 he doesnt seem to want to engage in any discourse
1530051 his few responses are non verbal theres very little eye contact occasionally hell nod or shake his head to answer
1530052 amid the aspirations and well wishes of the people of the entire city it will complete its harmonious journey welcoming the grand opening of the games
1530053 and how long have you known pi to one hundred decimal places
1530054 well what your seeing here is an attempt to twist my words into a meaning that was never intended and the bigger issue here is that the national party want to sell state assets and they really are quite desperate to get some traction on the issues so they are trying to turn it into a campaign of invented comments and this type of mis construing the facts is really why john key is the most cancerous and corrosive leader of a political party we have seen in recent years
1530055 global attainment of the health related mdgs will depend in no small part on indias achievements in improving health nutrition water and sanitation education and child protection gender equality and womens empowerment in the coming years
1530056 the infant mortality rate is 50 per cent higher in rural areas than in urban locations
1530057 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1530058 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1530059 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is
1530060 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1530061 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1530062 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1530063 i believe senator obama has just misunderstood and under appreciated this crisis it is going to need to be dealt with boldly and aggressively
1530064 he is obviously thrashing about trying to grab on to the idea and catch up to the idea for the week it is obviously belated it is obviously haphazard
1530065 delivers the heartbreaking storytelling side of nashville with the kind of song usually reserved for vets like reba mcentire or martina mcbride
1530066 that nice mr key like country bumpkins taken in by a con man
1530067 gets in the way of the campaign to eliminate peters
1530068 the ipod has done fantastic business but it still pales in comparison to the number of cellphones sold every year
1530069 i liken it to paying your electric bill you dont rent electricity
1530070 we had concerns about the willingness of consumers to add another subscription charge to their phone bill but its not as much of a problem as we had thought were doing much better than we had expected
1530071 it just took too long to iron out all the kinks and the dominance of the ipod left rhapsody out of the mainstream
1530072 i think rhapsody will wither away and eventually reincarnate as an ad supported business
1530073 if you knew exactly how much time you had left to live life as you know it
1530074 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1530075 this would presumably indicate that the foot belongs to a new missing person
1530076 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1530077 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1530078 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1530079 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sherrifs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1530080 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately
1530081 in the last couple of years weve had these tsunamis where thousands of people have died you cant help but think is it related to the tsunamis
1530082 i know that somehow theres a release that suggests there was a stall but we havent come to any of those conclusions
1530083 our investigators have been on the site and well be trying to get the wreckage off the hillside today
1530084 we know the weather was suitable for the flight to depart
1530085 however i believe we have the engines and propeller pieces that well be able to examine more closely
1530086 we can tell already that there was power at least in one of the engines and we have to look closer to determine the level of power in the other engine
1530087 initially we were receiving text messages from rcc the rescue centre in victoria from bob on the ground
1530088 it was a very big part of us having a successful mission
1530089 hes getting a bit stiffer and sorer as would be expected given the nature of the accident that he had but hes doing fine
1530090 you hope above hope that its going to be your family member
1530091 we were pretty ecstatic when we found out bob was still alive
1530092 why does the system not work the way it was intended and set up
1530093 does our prison system enable prisoners to repay their debt to society
1530094 certainly were still not at our top match condition but i expect my players will give everything
1530095 we have been following the program we decided on without worrying too much about the results of the matches we will face i wanted to play strong teams in our friendlies before the start of the championship
1530096 this game will be another workout against a very strong team its difficult to make a prediction on the tomorrows match
1530097 i have launched a legal action against zamparini on behalf of myself and my family
1530098 we want our case to be heard by the whole of italy zamparini brandished us as extorters and he has to answer to the courts now
1530099 italian football does not need these kind of people like grimaldi
1530100 i only told the truth about the amauri affair i will confirm what i have said on this issue and i have dozens of witnesses i havent spoken about extortion but when someone asks for two million euros you can make your own conclusion about the most appropriate term i hope they the grimaldi family have requested permission from the federal prosecutor
1530101 the mere fact of being at the olympics makes you dream of the highest honour
1530102 here we are all equal there is no age there are those who have played more and some who have not played this is a different adventure we are all starting from scratch with the same objective
1530103 brazil and argentina have something extra but they will have to prove it whoever wins in football is stronger
1530104 the west nile virus threat in southern california is severe
1530105 we are the epicenter of west nile virus in california
1530106 weve added a second crew that is treating all the storm drains were also working overtime saturdays and sundays trying to cut down on the mosquito population

1530108 the pitch for the series was well received except for the fact none of the usc faculty knew anything about making webisodes
1530109 mostly the response we got was sounds like a great idea
1530110 if you use the schools resources they own your copyright and will not allow you to post your work on the internet i ended up having to do a special thesis project where i received no support from the school but in turn id own the copyright
1530111 pulling it all together in post on a shoestring budget
1530112 on the average cheap side for a usc graduate thesis project
1530113 its a smaller site focused on comedy sure videos are getting hundreds of thousands of views on youtube but the majority of them are 30 second clips of umbrellas attacking women i was afraid since we were coming out of the blue with no advertising dollars and a longer run time we might get buried in a big place like youtube or myspace
1530114 the desire for quality web content is growing and somewhere down the line people are going to figure out the best way to monetize it maybe that time is already here just look at
1530115 moonwalk 1986 struggle to stand out among atoms huge lineup illeana douglas and her gang of stars are back with ikeas easy to assemble about us
1530116 sometimes that man get home he be lookin like he spent the day rollin round in oil i sure dont like washin these clothes but nobody else is goin to do it
1530117 when you dont have much money and want to buy a house you take what you can get
1530118 i got to go home and cook supper now i dont like doing it but nobody else is goin to
1530119 oh he eats pretty much whatever i cook hes just like that thats how i got so big because when you be cookin so much like that you got to taste the food when you always around food you just get big
1530120 when i go to the black neighbourhoods people relate to me and when i go the jewish neighbourhood they relate to me too
1530121 i gambled with a 4 but should have hit 5
1530122 for the next nine years or so i played some pretty consistent golf
1530123 i make everything but i lose it on the course i dont feel comfortable in that four to seven foot range its fear fear of hitting it too hard going through the break the tempo isnt there my stroke isnt fluid
1530124 my feeling is anybody whos buying our channel is watching our channel
1530125 traditionally britains standard definition is 30 per cent better than our standard definition
1530126 it sure didnt look like he ran into him on purpose
1530127 it seems they are very sensitive about anyone seeing anything to do with the rehearsals for friday nights big show the opening ceremony
1530128 there was nothing going on but when i started taking pictures of workers inside the stadium two chinese police officers came over individually to get me to stop
1530129 one wanted to take away my camera the other said the words delete pictures of course i refused i got off with a warning and he escorted me out of the stadium
1530130 our family doctor said to me that the earliest youll even begin to see things getting better is six months and ill bet you its closer to two years
1530131 were so close all aspects of our lives are so totally intertwined
1530132 lynn would have wanted no interruption in that for sure if id said forget it lynn would have been very disappointed with me its not an option
1530133 if i ever stopped i dont know where id ever start again
1530134 so id better not stop dont want to know got to keep going
1530135 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea

1530139 i think its a very well done and justifiable recommendation
1530140 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
1530141 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
1530142 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1530143 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1530144 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
1530145 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
1530146 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
1530147 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians
1530148 numbers are a major factor in being marginalized or being recognized by decision makers in public policy
1530149 what people do and how they think of themselves and how we want to classify their institutional affiliations are very very different
1530150 if you say you are episcopalian but you attend a baptist church on sundays with your wife who is baptist who counts you if neither one of you attends church anywhere what are you then
1530151 we are looking at the numbers at prayer ethnicity the role of the staff womens participation and level of involvement in american civic life
1530152 this is really going to tip you off to something you might not have any awareness of and that is if someone was using your identity without your knowledge
1530153 a rise in the value of nursery stock helped push the numbers up
1530154 averse to raising taxes but there comes a point in time when you just cant stretch any further lets not kid ourselves we need more funding if were going to see an expansion of firefighting services in this region
1530155 as its proposed its not quite ready for prime time
1530156 its pretty clear we have an opportunity and an obligation to act
1530157 improve the playback quality of some playstation 3 and playstation format software
1530158 anyone experiencing any problem should as usual contact customer services
1530159 amazons cd buyers tend to be older so they havent abandoned the cd format to the extent seen in the average music buyer plus amazons successful introduction of its digital download store will help the company improve its position in the future
1530160 the unique animation may help couples find love and me the perfect hat
1530161 who knows whats lurking behind the cartoon will they pick a real life jessica rabbit or will they choose something more akin to the infamous tasmanian devil
1530162 theres been many pretenders to her throne but she remains in a class of her own
1530163 theres no way we could have planned for almost doubling our sales
1530164 suppliers used to a fairly stable but slow growing market are going crazy
1530165 some are gone for the year and others are down to the last five or six
1530166 is that no one can take away whats in your heart and in your head
1530167 palladium is unique because we have a horizontal focus the ability to cross the spectrum of many industries
1530168 the u s hispanic market really does affect every industry
1530169 were seeing great demand and interest in reaching this market in a context thats family oriented
1530170 we were able to acquire that business whereas other larger strategic buyers could not
1530171 feel more comfortable sitting around a table talking having a little food and feeling like family
1530172 we want to make sure they fulfill their potential for economic success
1530173 this will continue to be a very strong long term trend and investment theme
1530174 i wanted confetti pieces not blue cake with confetti pieces
1530175 it has never been tougher to build and sustain a successful food and beverage business than it is today
1530176 were going to be very very focused on acquiring brands that fit in the product portfolio
1530177 its a lot harder to come up with nuggets of innovation but that doesnt mean they dont exist
1530178 thats the holy grail if mrs butterworth would really talk
1530179 what people dont have enough of is time these days
1530180 not everyone has time for the bowl the mix the egg
1530181 its a bit of a challenge to get the quality we want in the microwave
1530182 especially in these tough economic times if a consumer cant differentiate your product from anyone elses theyre going to resort to the lowest cost option
1530183 cambi mi punto de venta por algo m s similar a un local tradicional que me permite tener la privacidad que necesita un atelier de alta costura pero sin dejar de tener salida a la calle
1530184 coment la dise adora que de esta manera podr comercializar dise os propios de indumentaria sin dejar de dedicarse a las clientas que conf an en ella para las ocasiones c lebres y necesitan un trato personalizado
1530185 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season
1530186 i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1530187 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one
1530188 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1530189 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected
1530190 but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well
1530191 after evaluating and contacting all of the water systems in the upstate theres not an immediate crisis but theres not an immediate crisis because of the efforts that everyones been taking most everyone in the upstate water systems reported that they have seen at least a 10 percent in some cases as much as a 25 percent reduction
1530192 we have been in voluntary restrictions and our public in the immediate forecast for the upstate does not indicate there will be any relief from the drought
1530193 no dude i was totally driving next to a cell tower had to be your phone
1530194 no dude im actually standing in a cell tower had to be you
1530195 forgiveness is giving up all hope for a better past
1530196 we cant fly you here put you up or feed you
1530197 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet i mean i cannot even imagine how much that is but it is a lot
1530198 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1530199 the other aspect is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1530200 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1530201 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realisation of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1530202 i dont know when it was that i became a watcher of things i wish i could just say thank you just so into the universe
1530203 top 40 music hit seems like a relic of a different age and the billboard best sellers list hasnt done much to really update with the times
1530204 crawls some of the biggest music sites on the internet bebo myspace last fm itunes google and youtube to find out what people are writing about listening to watching downloading and logging on to it then counts and analyses this data to make an instant list of the most popular 1000 artists and tracks on the web the more blog mentions comments plays downloads and profile views an artist or track has the higher up the sound index they are
1530205 so i think it was natural for me to gravitate in that direction
1530206 the finite place where rational scientific knowledge stops and pure speculation ensues the event horizon between what we know and what we dont know is what keeps me awake at night but also gets me out of bed every day
1530207 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them
1530208 in that first month of life their breathing systems arent very developed yet
1530209 theyre very susceptible to harm even at very low doses
1530210 they raised a lot of possibilities in the study we dont know if theres a causal relationship
1530211 the question is what do you do in follow up
1530212 are you concerned about the growing prevalence of homosexuality in our society focus on the family cares and wants to equip you with the tools necessary to show the love of christ to those affected by homosexuality thats why focus on the family has created the love won out conference this dynamic one day seminar comprehensively addresses the issue of homosexuality
1530213 will help concerned citizens see how our first amendment rights to freedom of speech and religious expression are jeopardized by pro gay legislative and judicial efforts such as hate crimes enda laws and gay marriage
1530214 will equip attendees with the facts and strategies needed to effectively argue for the benefits of traditional marriage with friends co workers and legislators
1530215 will show how one concerned citizen stood firmly against gay activism in his city
1530216 our speaker exhorts the christian church to passionately reach out to those within the gay community without compromising its stand on biblical truth
1530217 offers practical tools in directing children toward a healthy heterosexual identity
1530218 outlines action steps in confronting gay affirmative curriculum and how to counter anti family activism in your schools
1530219 for young people 25 years of age and under to process what theyre learning about gods message to those who struggle with sexual identity
1530220 at this point it seems to be more personal than professional
1530221 this is a case based on drug dealers who want to avoid going to jail
1530222 you have the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa florida
1530223 theyre old crimes but the defense he used the last time that he resigned from the mob doesnt work in this case theres no statute of limitations on murder
1530224 it may be that the instruction was erroneous but i guess youve waived the right to challenge it by not challenging it sooner
1530225 we think that youve seen a fair and transparent process
1530226 this trial was a betrayal of american values and will rightly be seen as illegitimate by the rest of the world
1530227 we plan on charging at least 80 individuals down here
1530228 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1530229 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad
1530230 the recount somewhat lowers the credibility of the management team
1530231 assuming this was all a mistake it is particularly unfortunate management doesnt have the mandate they appeared to have had
1530232 upon review it was determined that there was a truncation error in the final printout sent to the tabulator
1530233 this resulted in the under reporting of shares withheld for certain directors
1530234 for the next several quarters there is going to be more noise especially with the stock below 20
1530235 its not just about the sport its about the image of china
1530236 weve waited and waited so long for the olympics to start
1530237 i feel proud i just hope nothing more goes wrong
1530238 we wonder why other countries hate us we have a game show in our country called
1530239 it seems to be an example of systematic planned doping

1530465 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1530466 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1530467 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1530468 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1530469 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1530470 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1530471 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1530472 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1530473 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1530474 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1530475 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1530476 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1530477 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1530478 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1530479 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1530480 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1530481 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1530482 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1530483 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1530484 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1530485 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1530486 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1530487 we prostrate ourselves at loves portals anxious for entry like social strivers waiting at the ropeline outside some exclusive club hoping to gain admission to its plushy chambers thereby confirming our essential worth and making us interesting to ourselves
1530488 you never know for sure how girls minds work do you really think its a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glass jar
1530489 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine
1530490 although elaine has been missing for 15 months we have not given up hope
1530491 i appeal to elaine to contact us either directly or through any intermediary to let us know how you are because we are desperate for news because we love you and miss you dreadfully
1530492 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1530493 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1530494 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1530495 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1530496 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1530497 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1530498 i have a friend i like like that and i don
1530499 hes had a great offseason and having a good camp
1530500 one of those guys youve got to pull back because theyre not going to pull back themselves
1530501 people on incomes of 300 000 are getting tax breaks of 3000 to enable them to buy private health insurance which they would buy anyway
1530502 the most common reason why new businesses shut down is that the owner runs out of money
1530503 at the beginning stages of a business this may mean doing work that might not be completely what you want to do but it helps pay the bills
1530504 if you had 24 hours to spend on a business they would be put to far better use by spending one hour a day than for 24 hours straight
1530505 nobody is perfect or has the skills to do everything themselves by getting people around you who complement your skills you will be able to achieve your goals and have a lot more fun along the way
1530506 there will be tasks in any business that you as the owner should not be focusing on if you hope to build any sort of sizable organization
1530507 if you read the stories of famous entrepreneurs and how they built their organizations you will find that it all comes down to the root of loving what you are doing
1530508 in year two entrepreneurs often find themselves still not making much money and the startup excitement has faded
1530509 the best way to make a lot of money quickly is to find a customer who has a problem and is willing to pay you to solve it and then you go out and build the solution
1530510 a great way to get a business going is to find out what other people have done to achieve success and implement those strategies into your own company
1530511 i dont make a habit of going to pinkberry but the koreatown location the one you called after the story about the controversial mandarin juicers broke is the closest froyo store to my place well while

1530513 sin duda que la conducta de navarro nos afecta y ojal que l lo entendiera
1530514 nosotros vamos a hacer es trabajar intensamente para apoyar los candidatos que tenemos en el caso de la comuna de estaci n central nosotros tenemos un compromiso con la concertaci n

1530517 la udi pudo haber nombrado un candidato presidencial hace m s de un a o en nuestro consejo directivo ampliado de hecho el nombre de pablo longueira estuvo disponible se decidi no tener candidato en ese momento y obviamente con el correr de los meses es cada vez m s dif cil que aparezca un nombre de la udi como un candidato presidencial competitivo pero puede todav a ocurrir
1530518 no hemos proclamado a pi era y respetamos los plazos eso no significa que en esta materia se act e no solamente con prudencia sino tambi n con realismo si la udi no es capaz de generar un candidato fuerte y que contribuya a tener m s votos la alianza obviamente habr que apoyar al m s posicionado
1530519 no hay dos opiniones en cuanto a que cualquier decisi n presidencial se va a asumir despu s de la municipal
1530520 ver lo que va pasando y buscar la mejor alternativa cuando sea necesario pues no tiene sentido anticipar un a o y medio ante la toma de una decisi n
1530521 a alguno le puede gustar m s un candidato u otro una estrategia u otra pero eso lo vamos a ver todos juntos despu s de las municipales y a m s tardar en abril
1530522 cuando tengamos los efectos de los descolgados de la concertaci n del pacto de la concertaci n con los comunistas los resultados de los partidos de la alianza los escenarios van a cambiar radicalmente no hay apuro
1530523 es imposible que una econom a se encuentre en crisis con este imacec
1530524 estamos tramitando el proyecto dentro del congreso y vamos a seguir nuestras conversaciones dentro del congreso
1530525 el gobierno ha estado abierto desde el primer momento estuvimos hablando m s de dos meses fue p blico con parlamentarios de la concertaci n y de la alianza y todos saben que se lleg a un acuerdo muy amplio y ocurri que por una decisi n pol tica alguien puso el freno de mano y el proceso de negociaci n termin abortado
1530526 los mismos parlamentarios que estaban en un momento dispuestos a llegar a un acuerdo sobre un cierto contenido estuvieran dispuestos a suscribir ese acuerdo naturalmente que el gobierno est dispuesto pero no hablemos ahora de que habr a que iniciar conversaciones con la oposici n despu s que hemos tenido un trabajo largo serio y sostenido
1530527 un protocolo de acuerdo con los temas de contaminaci n en todas las ciudades del pa s
1530528 los temas de medioambiente tienen que ver con la vida de las personas y quiz s son mucho m s importantes que el transporte y por esa raz n vamos a votar este proyecto en la medida que se adquieran esos compromisos de lo contrario no votaremos a favor de este proyecto
1530529 comp s de espera en lo que son las ciudades de menos de 50 mil habitantes no nos convence ni la forma de selecci n del uso de los recursos ni el uso pol tico que se pueda hacer de estas platas en regiones vamos a esperar respuestas del ministro a ma ana respecto a estos temas espec ficos
1530530 el compromiso del gobierno ha sido mantener las tarifas congeladas hasta diciembre por lo tanto los santiaguinos debemos saber que con o sin subsidio las tarifas van a subir el pr ximo a o y esa es una realidad que el ministro debe aclarar
1530531 se apruebe o no este proyecto de ley las tarifas comenzar n a subir en enero 20 por mes por contrato
1530532 congelada hasta fin de 2008 y cualquier incremento el 2009 va a ser moderado y gradual
1530533 que la tarifa tenga que comenzar a subir todos los meses en 20 pesos

1530537 people today are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with complex information and numbers what with all the stuff thats going on
1530538 the last thing they need is evan davies showing off with his double digit numbers and his hoity toity percentages
1530539 instead they want fiona bruce to stand in the street and make her eyebrows dance
1530540 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1530541 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1530542 that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1530543 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
1530544 increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population
1530545 this situation has forced many aid agencies to restrict the scale ad scope of their development and humanitarian operations
1530546 young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women are at especially high risk increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people
1530547 most afghans continue to live in an insecure environment where many of their basic human rights remain unfulfilled
1530548 much more investment and work remains before the international community fulfills the multiple commitments it has made to assist afghanistan

1530586 we have gained expertise in designing and building large scale energy intensive facilities by building efficient data centers
1530587 we want to apply the same creativity and innovation to the challenge of generating renewable electricity at globally significant scale and produce it cheaper than from coal
1530588 there has been tremendous work already on renewable energy technologies have been developed that can mature into industries capable of providing electricity cheaper than coal solar thermal technology for example provides a very plausible path to providing renewable energy cheaper than coal we are also very interested in further developing other technologies that have potential to be cost competitive and green we are aware of several promising technologies and believe there are many more out there
1530589 with talented technologists great partners and significant investments we hope to rapidly push forward our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal we are optimistic this can be done in years not decades
1530590 and large scale renewable deployments are cheaper than coal the world will have the option to meet a substantial portion of electricity needs from renewable sources and significantly reduce carbon emissions we expect this would be a good business for us as well
1530591 cheap renewable energy is not only critical for the environment but also vital for economic development in many places where there is limited affordable energy of any kind
1530592 lots of groups are doing great work trying to produce inexpensive renewable energy we want to add something that moves these efforts toward even cheaper technologies a bit more quickly usual investment criteria may not deliver the super low cost clean renewable energy soon enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change
1530593 google orgs hope is that by funding research on promising technologies investing in promising new companies and doing a lot of r amp d ourselves we may help spark a green electricity revolution that will deliver breakthrough technologies priced lower than coal

1530690 closing the gap on indigenous disadvantage i believe will lead to significant reduction in crime
1530691 to make sure that we respond in one way but then provide the opportunities afterwards
1530692 the issue is not specifically about euthanasia it is about a federal politician in canberra no connection to the northern territory just on his high horse and political grandstand using the northern territory to get a headline
1530693 a resource allocation model for policing would take the politics out of police numbers and this government simply failed to do that equally the opposition has completely failed to commit themselves to a similar process
1530694 both sides of politics have been aware of our policy positions and they have simply avoided this issue
1530695 if the northern territory government and the opposition and the previous northern territory government under the clp had of adopted a more sensible approach to policing the intervention would never of happened
1530696 all the education campaigns in the world will do nothing unless there is actual real enforcement
1530697 wed certainly like to see a some sort of management authority a harbour management authority that has some real legislative teeth that can take on that role that perhaps the epa or the in house government authorities cant do in an independent way
1530698 ive just been down to the sydney harbour a couple of times and seen how they have built right to the waters edge and it saddens me to think we need to be that close to the water
1530699 in 2004 i gave up a position that was one that i enjoyed one that was fruitful i gave that away
1530700 unfortunately on reflection im not prepared to do that twice
1530701 this purchase adds 10 per cent to the protected area in the marshes which in itself is significant
1530702 it also enables us to get the most water possible into the largest remaining area of semi permanent wetland in the macquarie marshes
1530703 it protects a very important bird breeding site for straw necked and white ibis and royal spoonbill in the lignum where the creeks join
1530704 i can hardly name an area where choice is needed more
1530705 its no big secret that the client side of the it environment is one of the last bastions of proprietary technology disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1530706 we have long believed that helping to bring openness and choice to the client desktop is one of the next things to explode in this whole march for linux
1530707 the problem is for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
1530708 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
1530709 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
1530710 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac
1530711 but for the typical environments windows apps are too pervasive and entrenched for a switch to make economic sense
1530712 we are now seeing finally the delivery of these kinds of land hand backs and conservation outcomes that many people have been working for for many many years now so it really is a significant event
1530713 it is 10 times the size of royal national park beside sydney but considerably smaller than kakadu
1530714 but i think its great benefit is because it is tropical rainforest it has got very high biodiversity half of australias butterfly species are found here so it is a jewel in the crown of our australian protected area of state
1530715 this new aboriginal owned national park does protect an area of great biodiversity great significance
1530716 but it also will give a longer term secure economic future to the traditional owners of this area because there will be opportunities to further develop ecotourism and activities that are compatible with these great landscapes
1530717 the medical board has snubbed its nose at those recommendations and the committee
1530718 simple ways to boost your metabolism for faster weight loss
1530719 we want to enable the portability that makes sense to cios
1530720 and the end user wants to be productive for the last 10 to 15 years we have focused on the device and on patching the device but as users use more different devices or work in the cloud they dont want to be concerned about the difference between them
1530721 and the underlying parts need to be managed in a consistent way
1530722 enterprise users can get applications provisioned for the user without needing to install the applications
1530723 also this lets users use an application license temporarily and then return it to the pool when done and software developers can use it to deliver applications across the internet without users needing to download the apps
1530724 this is just another example of the yawning gulf between morris iemmas rhetoric and the reality
1530725 this is just another example of a government thats so mired in leadership tensions that theyve taken their eye off the main game
1530726 domestic violence is a problem across nsw its incredibly disappointing it lets down the victims of domestic violence the fact that morris iemma hasnt followed through
1530727 our commitment was to have a fully staffed unit in the term of this government we are very much on track to do that
1530728 we do have a bit of a balancing act to do which will take a little bit of time to work through with the industry
1530729 you have to balance the compliance costs for business we dont want to say to them you have to do this tomorrow and therefore that increases the compliance costs of not only coles and woolworths but every other grocery retailer in the country
1530730 i want a flexible light handed system which doesnt force retailers to do it in a particular way but ensures that we have the right outcome
1530731 because it will mean theyll be able to make direct comparisons much more easily on prices
1530732 and im certain that the website going to be established with snapshots of prices from products will be used at least by a considerable number of shoppers to give them a sort of an idea about the competitive opportunities
1530733 these are the sort of things national governments can do theyre difficult for state governments the i would hope that perhaps even in tasmania we can see new entratnts because that in the end sharper competition is what matters
1530734 the former army scientist who was the prime suspect in the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings agreed friday to take 5 82 million from the government to settle his claim that the justice department and the fbi invaded his privacy and ruined his career
1530735 there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that dr hatfill had anything to do with this
1530736 when caesar crossed and trod beneath his feet the soil of italys forbidden fields here spake he peace here broken laws be left farewell to treaties
1530737 there is nothing more annoying than having to endure cigarette smoke wafting under your nose when youre trying to enjoy a meal
1530738 i think given that smokers are in the greater minority group these days that really people should be able to enjoy the social pleasure of an alfresco area
1530739 its a very strong smoke signal to the wa government to bring in some blanket bans across the whole of wa
1530740 if for no other reason than many people arent aware of where local government boundaries are and state legislation would be much easier to police than legislation thats brought in by local councils
1530741 many tourists coming from overseas are coming from jurisdictions where there dont even exist bans on indoor smoking let alone some sort of illogical nonsensical outdoor smoking ban
1530742 i am the security officer whom len kiely sexually harrassed
1530743 what len kiely did was totally inappropriate and hes made a full and public apology and not only a public apology but an apology to the lady affected
1530744 everybody deserves a second chance and im confident that len will continue to be a good local member for the people of sanderson
1530745 as a chief minister i could not stand on a platform of leadership and give support in any way to a man who has done this
1530746 twenty per cent of the homeless population live in queensland and yet only 17 per cent of the funding comes with it
1530747 so i think its really important that government really look at the kind of interventions that are necessary to make sure people have got access to housing and housing support as well as the family support needed for early childhood
1530748 were finding a lot more people are needing assistance than ever before and its becoming a major crisis
1530749 they really need to increase that saap money but of course when you look at saap money that only gives them temporary help
1530750 as is the proper process and what needed to be done
1530751 now obviously that has and rightly so caused significant stress for all of us and particularly for paula
1530752 but i want to make it clear that i had not accepted or recommended her resignation up until the point i spoke to her last which was on sunday evening
1530753 worship 1 2 went out in an email blast as noted on a previous post
1530754 grueling and decidedly unpleasant activity after all what could be more tiring than going from one place to another and peddling yourself
1530755 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
1530756 it was my fault after all but i did had fun with what i said in the end putting the wrong package back to shelf beside im real tolerance against people like that i find it funny
1530757 its going to be interesting to see if hes allowed to keep playing in france
1530758 if he does as good in rugby it wouldnt be bad would it
1530759 i sit on the fence because i have a lot of respect for both of them
1530760 but pressure is a privilege id rather go through life being under pressure than just cruising
1530761 la literatura es una forma de combatir la incomunicaci n que viene de la incomprensi n del prejuicio de la intolerancia y de la desconfianza frente al otro
1530762 es indispensable para la comunicaci n y el dialogo y ya sabemos que cuando no hay comunicaci n o di logo hay violencia
1530763 se ha diversificado tanto que la comunicaci n entre los seres humanos se ha empobrecido
1530764 la buena literatura nos comunica y nos recuerda que somos parte de una especie
1530765 entenderla mejor para saber de donde venimos y a donde vamos
1530766 la verdad es un camino que est en discusi n y no hay punto final
1530767 the fruits of his labor were protected against all unjust attack
1530768 now since man is naturally inclined to avoid pain and since labor is pain in itself it follows that men will resort to plunder whenever plunder is easier than work history shows this quite clearly and under these conditions neither religion nor morality can stop it
1530769 this belief is so widespread that many persons have erroneously held that things are
1530770 now legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it tariffs protection benefits subsidies encouragements progressive taxation public schools guaranteed jobs guaranteed profits minimum wages a right to relief a right to the tools of labor free credit and so on and so on all these plans as a whole with their common aim of legal plunder constitute socialism
1530771 gayle harrell has always been a strong supporter of the second amendment and has always believed it is an individual right as laid out by our founding fathers
1530772 the nra and usf have proven once again that they are organizations that understand that a candidates voting record speaks volumes louder than political promises
1530773 i am honored to receive the nra and usf endorsements

1530788 there will be lots of scientific data taken from this
1530789 there will be the liver and so forth will be sent away and examined and and also the stomach contents and methods that they determine the age and so forth of the fish which is fantastic as well
1530790 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1530791 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1530792 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1530803 in the persian gulf region the presence of american forces along with british and french units has become a semipermanent fact of life though the immediate mission of those forces is to enforce the no fly zones over northern and southern iraq they represent the long term commitment of the united states and its major allies to a region of vital importance indeed the united states has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in gulf regional security while the unresolved conflict with iraq provides the immediate justification the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
1530804 the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
1530805 this is the last time that i kneel and pray to the sky cause almost everything that i was always ever told was a lie
1530806 white house used forgery to create saddam al qaeda link

1530821 i think more than anything playing in that bowl game just proved to all of us that this is something we can do said fifth year senior cornerback chris phillips
1530822 before playing in a bowl game was something we had just always talked about i think we believed we could do it but until you have that experience you really dont know for sure now we know
1530823 when theres nothing on the horizon youve got nothing left to prove
1530824 i have also heard theyre fishing for sharks near foggys cave removing the fins and dropping the fish back over the side

1530826 they should be forced to anchor at least 10km off shore where the sand is flat and they wont hurt reefs and dive sites with their huge anchor chains
1530827 people on incomes of 300 000 are getting tax breaks of 3000 to enable them to buy private health insurance which they would buy anyway
1530828 then we might return to an equitable health system which doesnt require a healthy credit card just to access proper health care
1530829 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine

1530832 well these are my uncles brother and sister in law
1530833 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
1530834 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
1530835 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
1530836 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
1530837 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
1530838 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
1530839 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

1530843 our goal is to train as many people as possible
1530844 if you look at the area its a blue collar working community and if gas prices hit four dollars a gallon and the economy stinks its understandable that people start tightening their belts
1530845 it had an excellent manager who i knew very well
1530846 were all struggling to get through not knowing where were going to end up
1530847 we thought at least one in brooklyn center would remain open
1530848 it only just recently hit me that this life is just a state of mortality fading like the innocence of love
1530849 we stopped any production of any ads that were going to be going out and anything that was still up we asked to be removed immediately
1530850 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1530851 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1530852 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1530853 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1530854 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1530855 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1530856 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1530857 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1530858 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1530859 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important presidential election campaigns in years
1530860 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1530861 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1530862 they know very well that pacific countries are not ready to start any negotiations
1530863 we are still negotiating a controversial fta with the european union and a regional trade deal among ourselves we havent even begun to prepare our regional negotiating framework or undertake social impact assessments or reviews of pacific legislation that could be affected by a new fta with australia and new zealand
1530864 negotiations havent even begun and the australians are splitting the region by refusing to support a regional negotiating office and by holding out carrots like new workers schemes to gain support from individual pacific countries
1530865 it would be unfortunate if australia and nz were to use their position as key aid donor countries for the region to secure their own trade interests in any fta negotiations
1530866 we need to use international trade to enhance our development opportunities in the pacific
1530867 the australians are pressuring us to open all our markets to competition and to reduce our ability to stimulate local firms and service suppliers or to channel foreign investments toward local industry and employment
1530868 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy

1530871 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
1530872 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
1530873 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
1530874 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
1530875 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
1530876 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
1530877 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found

1530882 some of the girls have already grown prominent breasts and with all that i have learned i am worried about their futures
1530883 its about recognizing the power over relationships that exist because of property religion security economics citizenship and geography
1530884 when you talk about power assertion of a white woman over a brown man thats kyriarchy when you talk about a black man dominating a brown womyn thats kyriarchy its about the human tendency for everyone trying to take the role of lord master within a pyramid
1530885 where do all the artsy sexually adventurous san francisco hipsters go to date online
1530886 this study has shown that in chinese people with impaired glucose tolerance group based interventions targeting lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise produce a durable and long lasting reduction in incidence of type 2 diabetes since around 3 million excess deaths a year are attributable to diabetes worldwide lifestyle interventions seem to be a justifiable public health action both in developed and developing nations
1530887 we propose that lifestyle intervention should start much earlier when people are normoglycaemic to achieve true primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and its main consequence cardiovascular disease in this regard both population based strategies and those targeted at high risk groups should be applied
1530888 so we need to look at how we can better serve our changing population
1530889 other task forces have looked at specific things primarily space issues do we need to build new schools and where
1530890 this is a more comprehensive look we see the changes that are happening and want to be up front we dont want to be faced with problems that hit us in the face we want to be proactive
1530891 with the economy the way it is were all trying to eke a little more money out of a vehicle
1530892 whether its running it as long as you can or trying to get all the money possible out of a piece of equipment
1530893 we got plenty of use out of it and the fact that we were able to get anything out of it i was pretty pleased
1530894 im inherently cheap and i do like to try to help in any way that i can im aware of our what budget situation is its a crunch every year and every time we can get a sale of an asset thats no longer functioning for us im going to try to get a deal
1530895 im always slightly anxious at first with movie stars because they can either make your life a dream or a living hell
1530896 sometimes you get an actor who is majorly neurotic or powerful and controlling and its horrible billy crystal really wanted to be directing the movie
1530897 if youre hired as a director and someone says youre not really gonna be the director youre there to hold billys hand and really hes gonna direct it then thats fine but to not be told that and then to go in its an all out war and its not pleasant
1530898 im allergic to things like horses and cats when i made city slickers ii it was really dangerous because there were horses everywhere
1530899 i had to be drugged up to the eyeballs for that i couldnt breathe if i got near a horse it was horrible
1530900 its a very big surprise in life when you learn that not everyone is rooting for you its a very scary thing when you figure that out
1530901 i never imagined that worrying about what other people think of me would be a big part of my day but when you get that much negativity thrown at you you go whew ive got to cope with that
1530902 nothing i heard in the press resembled the truth what an insight for me
1530903 i took time off i wanted to get simple and quiet i wanted to laugh i wanted to travel
1530904 at this point we have not heard back from the supreme court
1530905 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1530906 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1530907 there were some internal discussions the reality being that judd is somewhat against marijuana use and i think it should be legal
1530908 we didnt really want to make a strong overall message about it we kind of wanted to leave it to the audience
1530909 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1530910 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1530911 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1530912 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1530913 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1530914 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1530915 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward
1530916 one of the most influential figures in latino literature in the united states
1530917 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1530918 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1530919 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1530920 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1530921 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1530922 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are
1530923 nobody else but the director was in the room she was operating the camera and we could hear her breathing there was nobody else on the set ever
1530924 the set was lit by the director of photography and isabel operated the camera then it was just the sound person myself and ben
1530925 telling kepesh kingsleys character that my character consuela had cancer was the most terrifying scene for me in that movie
1530926 it helped for such an emotionally exhausting scene that there were only four people there on the set
1530927 he had a stroke on may 9th but hes doing well hes doing really well in fact hes perfect
1530928 jim was at the medical centre for a routine outpatient check up with his doctor
1530929 they got billy friedkin and another opera director to do the first two acts of a puccini and i just have to do the third one and its a funny one its a 55 minute opera with 10 people
1530930 i made this promise to do it three years ago and i thought id be dead in three years and its never gonna happen so i said ok then i didnt die and the time came and so i started work on this opera on tuesday 05aug08
1530931 the opera is unlike the movies they boo ive been disliked but from a distance but this is different
1530932 ill give it my best shot but i really dont know what to expect
1530933 at law camp you do mock trials and they take you for a day at the court one of my favourite parts of law camp was when they showed us my cousin vinny they said heres what its like to be a lawyer
1530934 when my favourite part of law camp was watching my cousin vinny i realised maybe i dont really want to be a lawyer maybe i just want to act like a lawyer
1530935 various sleeping poses and the miraculous ability to wake up when destination is reached
1530936 do i stink or is there a ghost sitting next to me
1530937 lets give them different beliefs so that they will bicker incessantly
1530938 lets give them food rich in oil and fat so that acne wash companies can make money
1530939 i guarantee you that my contract will be like no other
1530940 it will be a ground breaking record contract for sure without a doubt theres so much money to be made right now in mixed martial arts and its all about the fighters trying to make that money its going to be a long term deal where i put my heart and soul into the company and help build them thats something im interested in doing theyre going to bring me on not just as a fighter but also doing some of the back work also
1530941 i would therefore suggest that fundamentalism is not primarily a religion of the marginalized as karen stated it is more salient feature is that develops among people caught off balance
1530942 praw r k ci pogro zdrajco a nie lew zima wasza a wiosna nasza czy widzisz to drzewo
1530943 unbeautiful is the title of one of my favorite songs on the album i called the album that because its when i hit rock bottom its the question a lot of people ask when theyre in a relationship and its like where was the point where you didnt find me attractive anymore its a universal feeling and an unusual word a lot of people ask me about it and relate to it and the world is not perfect right now unbeautiful seems like a realistic title for a lot of things that are happening
1530944 no favre will not play in green bay in 2008
1530945 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1530946 contudo existem cinco sinais t picos de qualquer grande e arrastada paix o que demonstram que os portugueses contra a vontade e contra a l gica continuam apaixonados por ela por muito afectadas que sejam as bocas que mandam
1530947 check your tires america that will save as much oil as offshore drilling will produce
1530948 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1530949 paris hilton actually has a saner energy plan than the little messiah no really watch
1530950 it was very exciting to put that beautiful place together poursohi
1530951 we have what marriages dont have its called music weve always realised that music is by far the most important part of our relationship
1530952 no matter how we feel about each other its the music and we always try to focus on keeping that as pure as we can
1530953 the things that used to p s us off a few years ago are meaningless
1530954 hopefully its because you get a little smarter as you get older we try to treat each other a little better be a little more respectful be a little more friendly
1530955 al assad did not come to mediate between us and the europeans we no longer need a syrian or non syrian mediator because the communication channels between us are open and direct in fact al assad visited us to convey his impressions of a private conversation that took place between him and french president nicolas sarkozy during his recent visit to paris
1530956 my dear you pursued your late fathers policy under which our relations continue to be good and distinguished
1530957 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sheriffs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1530958 as our season progressed and it became obvious we were not going to reach the goals we had entering this year we began internal discussions on the best time to convert brandon back to a starting role
1530959 we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1530960 we dont know if hes going to get any starts
1530961 i couldnt believe the phone wasnt ringing from somebody coming to take jose vidro he really was swinging the bat good
1530962 i know the batting average might not indicate that he was having a good year but the rbis per at bat i thought were really good the quality of his at bats i thought was good i just thought by the trading deadline somebody would have asked for jose but that didnt happen
1530963 de acordo com o depoimento da mesma fonte pol cia holandesa a menina esteve na sua loja em maio do ano passado com um homem uma mulher e outras duas crian as que n o tinha ar de boa pessoa
1530964 eu perguntei onde estava a passar f rias mas ela n o me soube responder ainda a inquiri se estava num parque de campismo ou num hotel mas ela n o sabia
1530965 tamb m lhe disse que a achava muito querida e ofereci lhe um bal o mas ela n o aceitou depois ouvi a senhora a chamar por ela mas n o disse maddy mas antes um nome longo podia ter dito
1530966 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1530967 after making a deal with the state where felony charges were dismissed so that he could get himself reinstated with the nfl
1530968 nine months later he comes forward with this story about how mr edwards did this
1530969 after the state agreed not to prosecute him for these attempted murders
1530970 i think he needs to look at all the discovery before he goes popping off like that
1530971 well if this is as good as its going to get ok
1530972 they are never going to change so i might as well get used to it
1530973 we must address this to ensure that there is a constant supply always
1530974 we need to ensure supply before we can ensure that prices are reasonable
1530975 the price negotiation takes time as we have to keep referring to the treasury delays can cause farmers to mess up their schedule for the next planting season
1530976 enjoyable baseball flick spiked with humour and no small amount of self parody
1530977 the 1976 rendition has a fresh breezy feel to it the screenplay by lorenzo semple jr three days of the condor is relentlessly tongue in cheek and theres an air of self aware campiness pervading the project
1530978 we never planned nor even considered charging passengers by weight
1530979 anyone who doesnt smile is probably either too adult to count or too dead to care
1530980 the film seems to have its pulse on some peculiarly modern varieties of madness
1530981 the cast does its stuff to good effect coward as the highly patriotic business like master crook brings all his imperturbable sense of irony and comedy to his role
1530982 fatal attraction has an inescapable pull to it its suffocatingly exciting
1530983 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1530984 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1530985 that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1530986 the 10 day jail term was not excessive and the magistrate had considered all the factors in the case before passing the sentence
1530987 im still in a daze its like im dreaming sixteen long years and finally i have achieved it
1530988 now im one of the top bowlers in the professional world i have a chance to compete on a regular basis with these pros im not thinking about targets just yet im still trying to catch my breath
1530989 when i first came to compete in the event my goal was to earn a spot on the womens tour i knew it will be tough but i told myself that the us open is the only trial for the tour and considering that i have been working hard all these years to reach this stage i was determined not to waste this chance
1530990 the trial judge did not take into account the three cases in sentencing radzi
1530991 as a print publication weve been in circulation for 10 years now
1530992 now there are many readers who want to read us online
1530993 as for our print publication cbt new sunday times we will be guided by the principle that were here to serve our readers the community of motorists motorcyclists and motor clubs
1530994 however in continuing our responsibility to our readers we believe that we must embrace the internet the sooner the better
1530995 cbt will continue to evolve and publish on a weekly basis we hope existing readers continue to enjoy the luxury of getting our motoring news in hard copy
1530996 sin ni siquiera haber comprobado su viabilidad auditando la existencia de espacio libre la entrada en edificios y el despliegue de fibra ya realizado por telef nica que condiciona la viabilidad de esta medida
1530997 it is my view that if a company has an outsourcing contract with a multinational firm then the company has a responsibility to obey all conditions of the contract
1530998 nike has a right to make sure the factory belonging to hytex apparels obeys the conditions it is a business deal
1530999 what i said earlier was that we would investigate and make an official statement what came out in certain papers was a total misquote and purely a miscommunication
1531000 perhaps it is time that we looked into this issue since we have many international companies coming to do business in our country
1531001 we have to overcome our problems with reliability and with our tyres performance
1531002 but for sure reliability is the biggest thing because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometres from the end
1531003 we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today sunday was really the fact that on one side we were able to jump in front and do our race as we were able to do and on the other hand in the first part in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
1531004 what we need to improve is looking ahead above all at the next grand prix where maybe there will be tricky conditions in terms of temperature in terms of the situation weather something like that
1531005 for sure we need to prepare our cars and tyre set up maybe in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
1531006 again the response from the motor racing fraternity for this race is very encouraging we had 103 cars and 309 drivers registering last year and i am confident that the numbers would be about the same
1531007 the mme has clearly progressed to become asias biggest race as it had aspired when we first mooted the idea of organising the 12 hour endurance race in 2000
1531008 he felt it right away reported it to the staff and looked very relieved that nothing was broken
1531009 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1531010 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1531011 will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
1531012 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1531013 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short im not involved in two of the formats i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1531014 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1531015 michaels training is going really well and by the time we get back hell be ready to train with the group
1531016 the first game might be a bit too early but the second games a possibility
1531017 hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1531018 not many people realise that being a supporting cast is actually very challenging especially when one has only a few scenes in it
1531019 i was also pregnant with my third child while filming puteri gunung ledang
1531020 i dont talk much either the challenge for me is to portray mona fully in such a limited time
1531021 mona is not a two dimensional character shes a victim who has illusory views of herself and how others view her in a way she is quite pathetic because she thinks so highly of herself
1531022 i do realise i have an obligation to fans who appreciate my work but at this juncture of my life i am ill suited for some of the roles that come my way
1531023 besides there are many young and talented actresses who can fulfil these roles nowadays if i ever decide to go into acting i will first look at the script
1531024 its great to work in such a close knit group and feel a sense of belonging
1531025 its more viable because one will have a say from beginning to end
1531026 we plan to set it up hopefully by next year
1531027 fifteen years ago you would never hear the word branding maybe at 1 of the campuses
1531028 the institution is not behind an ivy covered wall any more it has thousands of touch points available on the internet to untold constituencies all of the time
1531029 its more apparent that without some management and institutional command about their message its all over the place
1531030 we have been training hard so the players will be able to perform well they are doing well so far but every team that have made it this far are good i am just taking one match a time
1531031 we will be able to give to a good fight against selangor and the players are looking forward to the match
1531032 we are also looking at ways to improve and expand the pedestrian walkway in the heritage zone and also to implement a tourist management plan we would ensure the state provides quality accommodation and also facilities such as information kiosk tourist police internet facilities a network of public transport and proper signage
1531033 we have sought the services of royal malaysian navy divers as they are equipped for deep water diving
1531034 with what little i have witnessed of brandon moss this weekend he reminds me personality wise of a cross between sean casey off the field and ty wigginton on the field
1531035 some people expected you to start the season in triple a pawtucket was that where you thought youd begin the year
1531036 no i expected to be here in portland i finished well last year but theres a lot for me to develop yet theres a lot to learn of course that doesnt mean im content i want to earn a promotion and move up but im still just 22 i have a lot of room to grow as a baseball player

1531054 i design elegant gowns that are likely to be in fashion for a longer time than just one season
1531055 i did not wear a wedding gown then only a plain and simple dress because we had a civil marriage ceremony
1531056 i didnt know anything until i reached the hotel in taipei
1531057 she xu deserves it she had been there for me through thick and thin it feels like were getting married all over again
1531058 our first was two years after our wedding we flew into london bringing along a photographer whose trip we sponsored and then we did a european tour we took pictures in london venice and paris
1531059 but as long as ji is happy i am also happy to do it shes a natural in front of the camera instead of taking cues from the photographers she takes over the shoot
1531060 having a distinct brand identity is becoming increasingly important for automakers in todays fiercely competitive environment
1531061 to differentiate our products we focus on popular japanese attitudes and ideas about living space and ambience as seen in our ancient teahouses there is a tradition here of higher priority on the interior of the structure where guests are received than on the exterior when travelling japanese people traditionally cared more about comfort than speed as well
1531062 traditional expectations for automotive interiors centred on luxury or beauty
1531063 in introducing the modern living concept with the teana we wanted to challenge that tradition
1531064 she was a woman ahead of her time and im delighted to play her
1531065 she stressed the importance of having the right balance of academic excellence and religious knowledge
1531066 i believe theatre including musical theatre is a great way to introduce past heroes to the younger generation
1531067 he fernandez is not helping the industry at all if he persists in defying the proposal
1531068 fernandez is a credible figure in the industry and he should not meddle in this issue
1531069 ours is a small and humble industry fernandez should be helping to boost the industry rather than destroying it
1531070 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1531071 i learnt ballet when i was nine and by the time i was 15 i fell in love with latin dance
1531072 it somehow releases my emotions be it happiness or sadness it is also a challenge to explore how my body works and creates graceful moves
1531073 the journey to the top was a tough climb in the process ive learnt to become a more mature and stronger person besides gaining many new friends who share my passion for dance
1531074 my hope and goal in life are to explore what i can do in dancing and move beyond the genre that i specialise in which is latin dance it is a journey to find the inner me that is missing in my dancing

1531087 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach
1531088 what was handed over to eu foreign policy chief javier solana was a written transcription of the discussions he had with irans top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili over the telephone monday not a response to the package of proposals
1531089 we have received the letter but we do not know its contents yet
1531090 obviously as weve stated before were looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them as part of our dual track strategy
1531091 the offensive materials directly contradict the values that my parents taught me and are forbidden in my parents home

1531093 this auction will allow us to implement market mechanisms on a small scale gauge interest and determine a slots market value
1531094 however the real winners in this auction will be consumers who stand to benefit from more reliable air service that costs less in terms of both time and money
1531095 we have seen significant progress being made in the affected areas as a result of the coordinated efforts of local and international humanitarian actors however much more urgently needs to be done in remote areas where affected communities are still living in dire conditions
1531096 the courts sentence reflects the gravity of the defendants egregious conduct
1531097 although nothing can erase the scars of a rape hopefully the courts action will help the victim feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is behind bars for life
1531098 my basic message is that muslims are no different from christians jews anyone

1531114 im sure he thought he was ready to run for a championship the first year he came in
1531115 but in reality i think this is the first year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or anyone else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1531116 i feel like im better as a racecar driver than ive ever been
1531117 i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i do understand things better than i ever have
1531118 the championship normally winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad and carls going to be ready to do that this year
1531119 the difference between second and 20th doesnt matter at all towards our season right now
1531120 its pretty much just time to go for wins the bonus points are key any points are the championship can be won by one point
1531121 we really messed ourselves up with some things this season
1531122 we had a little bit of bad luck thats kept us from winning some races

1531135 its no big secret that the client side of the it environment is one of the last bastions of proprietary technology disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1531136 we have long believed that helping to bring openness and choice to the client desktop is one of the next things to explode in this whole march for linux
1531137 the problem is for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
1531138 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
1531139 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
1531140 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac
1531141 but for the typical environments windows apps are too pervasive and entrenched for a switch to make economic sense
1531142 we are extremely excited about this project and feel it will be a win win for both our hotel guests and for sunset hills by providing additional revenue to the club
1531143 if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime
1531144 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1531145 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1531146 reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1531147 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1531148 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1531149 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1531150 people are saying its woody allens steamiest movie im thinking
1531151 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged obamas health care plan stop the abuses of nfp hospitals find out what hes not telling you barack obama figurine barack obama oddfellow pvc figure 5
1531152 when they got close she hid her head behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out
1531153 this is a problem up and down the coast particularly on docks
1531154 she was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up
1531155 hed just turn his nose up to the sun and just look at us like im here so what it was just the darndest thing
1531156 ive never seen anything so preposterous and ive been sailing for years and years
1531157 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1531158 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1531159 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1531160 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1531161 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1531162 one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1531163 i ask you therefore will you love her honor and keep her and be faithful to her so long as you both shall live
1531164 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
1531165 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited
1531166 amid the aspirations and well wishes of the people of the entire city it will complete its harmonious journey welcoming the grand opening of the games
1531167 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1531168 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1531169 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1531170 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1531171 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1531172 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1531173 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1531174 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1531175 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1531176 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
1531177 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1531178 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1531179 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1531180 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1531181 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1531182 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1531183 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1531184 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1531185 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1531186 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1531187 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1531188 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1531189 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1531190 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1531191 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1531192 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1531193 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1531194 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1531195 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1531196 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1531197 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1531198 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1531199 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1531200 research suggests that network analysis which companies use to improve business outcomes by analyzing information flows and personal relationships could speed the adoption of vaccines
1531201 on how frequently participants exchanged information with whom they exchanged it the value they ascribed to those interactions and the types of information they exchanged we hoped that the maps would show us how national and international roles are connected and which roles are central and valuable in this way the maps might help stakeholders understand how to improve decision making processes and thus hasten the introduction of vaccines
1531202 decision makers in egypt mauritania and zambia didnt actively engage global experts on the specific diseases these countries were targeting
1531203 given the importance of financing vaccine programs sustainably especially in countries that renegotiate funding every year these conclusions are troubling

1531207 you look like a barber pole holding a megaphone little father
1531208 this is proper attire for directors of theatre remo i wouldnt expect your artless soul to comprehend
1531209 okay okay you dont have to shout im right here
1531210 but seriously little father couldnt you have at least cast someone who looked a little more like me to play my part and dont even get me started on the name of my character
1531211 dennis ullard is an exceptable name for a white and who would you have me cast as mr d ullard
1531212 i dunno maybe killroy hamm at least he looks a little like me
1531213 hes tall and thin plus he hasnt done any movies lately so hes probably available
1531214 i do not know this actor what tales has he performed
1531215 well he got his start in a movie called college
1531216 well he really hit the big time when he did a movie called fancy free about a kid who brings dancing to a small conservative town
1531217 dancing is an honorable pastime remo but alas i am not familiar with this story what else might i know him from
1531218 well after that he sort of started doing bad direct to video movies lets see there was sandworms and then sandworms 2 then sandworms 3 the return of the sandworms then he starred in shallow man that was a movie about a guy who can become completely silent anything ringing a bell
1531219 i loved the sandworms movies such artful storytelling i know the actor you are talking about remo he would be miserable in your role however i might consider him for the part of the wisened master
1531220 why did you have to bring all your trunks on set chiun
1531221 because remo one can never be too prepared we will be filming the love scene soon and i must change into the proper attire before giving direction now kindly move the trunks to the right of my chair they are blocking my view of the set
1531222 chiun im going for a walk im not sure when ill be back
1531223 its not a sure thing in other words that an a la carte menu will end up giving us the widest possible array of choices
1531224 the transcontinental railroad was to the real estate of inland america as itunes is to the music marketplace of today
1531225 the event felt especially energetic since there were so many new ideas about distributing movies and connecting with audiences and lots of folks eager to hear those ideas
1531226 i decided that the only way to prevent yahoo from spoiling sports and other shows was to never go to their homepage hence no more yahoo search for me
1531227 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline with near total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution a shift towards broadband media will come largely on hollywoods terms and at an incremental pace
1531228 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
1531229 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for
1531230 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept practically no one was yesterday the same thing happened with my chicago audience of about 300 people maybe 10 percent of the hands went up when i asked how many knew about the long tail
1531231 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would
1531232 on november 13 2005 google announced google analytics a free web analytics service targeted at the long tail of small and medium size businesses that lack a web analytics solution
1531233 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
1531234 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
1531235 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
1531236 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
1531237 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
1531238 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
1531239 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
1531240 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
1531241 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
1531242 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
1531243 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
1531244 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
1531245 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
1531246 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
1531247 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
1531248 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
1531249 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
1531250 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal
1531251 in the latest sign that the rules of television are being turned on their head the two divisions of time warner inc
1531252 but within their niche they dominate a site that ranks as number 100 000 in the overall web universe would still be the fifth largest within its niche big enough to throw some weight around furthermore niches have their own niches focusing on a highly targeted subtopic can make even a tiny site with a few hundred thousand page views stand out
1531253 the business is made much more complex by windows and audiences that are fragmenting
1531254 the story for the next 10 years is how content is going to adapt you wont find your audience in any one place anymore
1531255 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
1531256 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
1531257 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson
1531258 the obscure articles edited by a few authors that know about the subject are honestly some of the best in wikipedia i think as long as they are not about anything controversial usually they arent though or they would have more editors
1531259 i am wallowing in composers and works that i had never heard of svendsen vieuxtemps pitfield grieg other than the great piano concerto
1531260 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
1531261 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear
1531262 id like to suggest that theres a 4th ascendant force 4 increasing opportunities to reuse content product service in new and more convenient contexts
1531263 if your posts have contextual advertising just because they dont earn any ad revenue right away does not mean that they will not give you a healthy return over several years make regular but relevant references to your older posts to help the long tail phenomenon on its way
1531264 a new low cost hardware and software b cost effective services providing next to unlimited hosting space and bandwidth costs for independent producers c new ways modes and devices to access store retrieve and play back video content on personal home and portable media devices d online content clearinghouses search engines and human ratings and recommendations e p2p distribution technologies f powerful technology based innovations slashing marketing and distribution costs
1531265 you dont need an oxbridge degree a million dollar trust fund or a nobel peace prize to earn the respect of women these days just head out to the shops and buy yourself a designer bag better yet make it the it bag of the season
1531266 for example i was at a popular geek hangout iin my neighborhood named crepes on cole and noticed that the onion had an ad for magnolia a beer pub theyre just 5 blocks away from where i was having my coffee brilliant
1531267 one notion in particular might help mainstream companies the meme about the perpetual beta were so used to not releasing a product a service an idea until its fully baked but with the web 2 0 you have permission to play around with things to work on them as people are watching with the help of people
1531268 made little impression in his native land and his impact was only slightly greater in england and france yet he is responsible for inventions familiar and useful to us all he was the first to devise and publish all of the common statistical graphs the pie chart the bar chart and the statistical line graph
1531269 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
1531270 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company
1531271 just one of a search engine spammers spam sites could have 30 000 pages
1531272 a key result of the shift in distribution patterns was the streamlining of the way retailers ordered books from publishers
1531273 im working on an r amp d project at at amp t labs that employs an in house sampling algorithm that has been proven optimal in its ability to reduce yet retain accuracy of data that follows a heavy long tailed distribution were currently using this algorithm in a product that measures ip internet protocol traffic volumes which happen to follow the lt distribution in enormous networks im very interested in applying this technology to other lt distributions that can potentially benefit i e environments that produce lt distribution data in large volumes
1531274 in exchange for access to the thousands of promotracks available in the system qualified podcasters and bloggers must comply with a few simple rules designed to raise awareness of the artists and labels and drive sales of their music
1531275 japanese has a tradition of being insular most of us dont have tendency to be passionate to niche foreign culture mostly because of language barrier
1531276 at least 80 of the traffic i get to posts after 3 months are via the search engines that match niche content with niche interests the filters of the web
1531277 i see lots of similarities between the long tail and web 2
1531278 how can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want
1531279 new communication technologies and the lowered cost of participation they created allowed the linux movement to effectively harness a large and diverse wealth of programming power that would otherwise have been unavailable to it
1531280 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

1531282 the complexity of the threat posed by open source warfare in iraq has accelerated the us militarys use of outsourcing traditionally the long tail has been used to describe the number of support personnel the tail required to support combat troops the tooth tooth to tail ratios have grown over the years as the complexity and resource intensity of modern combat has increased in essence modern warfare requires a loooong tail of support troops the us militarys tooth to tail ratio is approximately 1 to 10 or more
1531283 as in other domains this move towards distributed creation and production is being driven by more affordable and accessible tools of production the backwoods meth producer is a direct descendant of the backwoods hootch producer during the prohibition we may not like what they are producing but history has shown they will be quite creative in finding ways to produce it themselves the mit fab lab participant the remix dj at the local hip nightclub the extreme sports enthusiast and the backwoods meth producer all share a common passion producing goods and experiences on their own terms
1531284 consider postal service fulfillment of transactions made on the internet about two million prescriptions a day roughly one fifth of the total are delivered by first class mail ebays vendors list five million new items daily and those that are sold ship mainly by mail one pitney bowes study found that online retailers were increasingly using paper catalogs sent through the mail to steer people to their sites
1531285 some tracks will dip as low at 39 pence 72 cents halving itunes and virgin price points as part of the hmv plan developing artist tracks and deeper catalog will carry the lower price points while premium songs will carry higher tags in the end hmv will buck the uniform pricing approach popularized by itunes a result that major labels have been pushing for
1531286 paypals transaction fee is typically volume based and ranges from 1 9 to 2 9 percent in addition to a charge of 0 30 per transaction in the case of the new model for micro payments which paypal describes as payments of less than 2 the fee is 5 percent plus 0 05 per transaction

1531288 to me this shows another crack in the traditional producer distribution audience models it is obvious that scholars and professionals were not the audience the two beethoven enthusiasts were first doing what they wanted to enjoy and couldnt find and now they are hoping to reach the mainstream in a way academicians and virtuosos cant as doc searls points out this is the demand side supplying itself
1531289 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people
1531290 netflix makes it harder and harder for a customer to consider leaving the system for a competitor the more the user sees benefit from participation the more they give the more they give the less likely they are to leave even if there was a way to take your data to another service the system builds loyalty to the brand and the user experience that theyve spent time and energy learning
1531291 knowing that it would be difficult to match wal mart and best buys prices on the sale of new dvds without wreaking havoc on its margins blockbuster has instead decided to concentrate on the sales of used videos next year the company plans to make selling and trading used dvds and its video game operation priorities
1531292 in a world in which consumers can increasingly access precisely what they want on the device and in the location they chose for the price they want to pay the ability to use repackage and market content to meet users higher customization personalization and functionality standards gets you a lucrative seat at the big table but playing that game means changing relationships at every level of the media and entertainment supply and demand food chain from content distributors providers and producers as well as advertisers and marketers
1531293 in this new world of choice and control at the edges its the niches and those who can pull them together who win besides a universal top n00 list is even a bad execution of big media think when ad age gives you lists of magazine revenue it separates womens and entertainment and business publications in big media those pass as niches and they are far more valuable comparisons when talking about newspapers you dont lump in metro papers with town papers with trade papers its a meaningless lump when somebody can tell me who the queen of the knitting bloggers is then ill listen and so will knitting advertisers
1531294 one by one the big houses in new york looked at
1531295 the new dvd audience is so diverse that companies can target niche markets and still sell millions of disks

1531298 radio and tv are going to have to adjust to a new economy the economy in which the long tail plays a major role
1531299 now you have paid online radio and free online radio paid online video and free online video at first the paid stuff is good and the free stuff is less good but soon producers seeking an audience start to make their stuff free because when they do the audience goes up 100x and then in order to compete others do the same thing wouldnt you if you had a touring band wouldnt you if you had already exhausted your dvd sales and wanted a big enough audience for your sequel
1531300 what about implicit events like the opening hours of the local go kart race track
1531301 the long tail approach to keywords advocates the use of
1531302 the movie studios to their credit use a form of dynamic pricing they intelligently recognize that a content items value is highest when first released and then subsequently fades the music labels have mostly avoided this strategy but perhaps thats changing i just noticed this little tidbit on amazon a long list of interesting cds for sale on amazon for between 6 and 10
1531303 we can study a culture by studying the differences in the power law approximated by the tag clouds used by people of that culture we could even measure cultural eartquakes by measuring the difference between the tag cloud being generated before and after a certain event
1531304 it makes them complacent look at all the money still rolling in
1531305 compare the tv model to music music is released television is scheduled thats going to change since the mid 1990s the internet has shown people a different model one where you get what you want when you want it where the channel model is replaced by the site model channels are limited sites are not
1531306 at the heart of ceo marc benioffs strategy is the idea that companies with deep industry knowledge will have more success creating their own specialized programs than salesforce could
1531307 microsoft and intel seem to think it is in their interest to cooperate with this approach and limit the ability of users to find new opportunities the long tail gets truncated its like cisco helping china control the spread of bad ideas
1531308 get your head out of your ass this isnt about giving away music this is about breaking bands people have to be exposed to the music somehow if you dont seed the system how will they
1531309 but amazon has a two pronged strategy to monetize the emergence of third party sellers and producers first it has acquired two companies booksurge and custom flicks to facilitate the direct publishing of books and movies which it can then sell second amazon is pushing third party sales via its web site and providing e commerce tools for large etailers 975 000 venders now sell on amazons site and 28 of amazons sales came from third party sellers in q2 up from 24 a year earlier
1531310 they want to get people innovating around their products to see what they can themselves produce to see where the market can go to get the early developers the people at the edges doing stuff which could potentially be mainstream because the people at the edges are are usually those ahead of the crowd

1531331 there were three different bands playing various types of music that originated in new orleans all that joie de vivre came from the love of all things new orleans the music the outlandish celebration of mardi gras the let the good times roll spirit among others i felt a pang of sadness at what a treasure new orleans is and how its struggling to fully recover and get its mojo back
1531332 ive attended the benefits organized by new orleans musicians their sadness is palpable
1531333 many shed tears as they performed they told of losing prized instruments music awards and their sense of community
1531334 a couple of middle class neighborhoods were hit hard too my niece has friends who lost everything because everything they had was tied up in their homes some people have established lives for themselves in other parts of the country but many simply cant go home because theres no home to go back to with no or not enough money from their insurance companies and in many cases no way to reinsure their homes theyre stuck in limbo
1531335 i want to capture the musical heritage of new orleans for people who want to help and to remind people whats at stake

1531342 you cant always tell one from the other and its best not to judge a book by its tattered cover i have found when i tried or looked deeper inside what appears unadorned might be wondrously formed you cant always tell but sometimes you just know
1531343 ive come to believe that mystery is as near as my front porch

1531381 i see youre swapping the red flag for the union jack now
1531382 however we also have the obvious contradiction that four officials of batu a congress affiliated union are daily crossing the official pickets of another congress affiliate and once in the building are attempting to do the work of the strikers
1531383 the fact that paid union officials are crossing an official picket is deeply damaging and potentially very embarrassing not only to batu but to the entire trade union movement
1531384 we want to get out of our group thats the mentality that we need to have going in after that anything can happen and we just hope to play our game we have a talented group and the rest will take care of itself
1531385 i know a lot of people arent giving us much of a chance to get out of the group
1531386 and we know that but people have been wrong about american teams in the past and weve been able to prove people wrong i think we can surprise a lot of people in this tournament

1531388 meanwhile another lawyer may venture into the statewide elections next year former del c richard cranwell confirms that he is considering a bid for lieutenant governor currently chairman of the democratic party of virginia cranwell served for 30 years in the house of delegates he practices with cranwell moore amp emick in vinton
1531389 if he runs cranwell will face southwest virginia businessman jon bowerbank who is actively campaigning and has raised more than 220 000 for his bid for the 2009 democratic lieutenant governor nomination jody w wagner secretary of finance under gov tim kaine also has been mentioned as possible lieutenant governor contender
1531390 republicans created in effect minority districts wherein narrow bands of the electorate often anti tax conservatives have disproportionate influence the key to winning and holding such house seats sucking up to the right its not always a pretty sight but survival compels it and its not just accommodating the grass roots to prevent nomination challenges republicans must kowtow to the house leadership lest they risk such punishment as losing prized committee seats senate republicans many of them recovering tax aholics have become similarly sheepish
1531391 the reformer is always right about what is wrong he is generally wrong about what is right

1531409 despite concerns of deterioration in its core market cisco reiterated its long term growth guidance giving jittery investors some comfort
1531410 a lot of people were worried that the number would have to come down
1531411 if anything it gives people confidence that off this low q1 number they are anticipating a sequential rise
1531412 while it is very difficult to predict when we may see a stronger spending environment by our customers and return to our 12 percent to 17 percent long term growth objectives our best estimate is that the current economic challenges remain with us for the next few quarters
1531413 during each economic slowdown cisco has always navigated through them very effectively gained wallet share and in my opinion market share

1531415 at one point the lights went off in the house and the microphones were turned off in the chamber meaning republicans were talking in the dark
1531416 bring the congress back lets have a real up or down vote
1531417 this band of brothers here is staying late to make a point to the american people we want to work

1531419 today is the 2008 version of the boston tea party
1531420 without your help we wont be able to do anything like the founders of this country were going directly to the american people
1531421 tell your congressman we dont want you back home we want you in washington this could be americas greatest hour insist that we come back to vote
1531422 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1531423 overall the local advertising market is highly challenged at the moment

1531425 we do not hold god who is alone absolute truth but we are held by god and so we are held by the truth
1531426 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
1531427 whatever an enemy might do to an enemy or a foe to a foe the ill directed mind can do to you even worse whatever a mother father or other kinsman might do for you the well directed mind can do for you even better
1531428 the one thing i want to leave my children is an honorable name
1531429 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed
1531430 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
1531431 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1531432 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1531433 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1531434 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1531435 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1531436 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1531437 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1531438 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1531439 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1531440 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1531441 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1531442 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1531443 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1531444 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1531445 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1531446 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1531447 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1531448 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1531449 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1531450 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1531451 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1531452 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1531453 our embassy is of course gathering information from the authorities
1531454 i believe there is no mistake so we plan to protest strongly
1531455 it is extremely unfortunate that a working reporter who followed the correct procedures should be the victim of violence
1531456 i hope you are getting paid well to do this because we know who you all are
1531457 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1531458 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1531459 for these two people it is very clear that they are part of violent terrorist forces
1531460 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open
1531461 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1531462 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1531463 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1531464 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1531465 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1531466 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1531467 it is difficult to talk about this but far worse things happen to people i have never been the one to whine and drop my head i always try to come out stronger though these words might sound like an empty phrase those who know me know thats the way i am its enough to see me in matches unfortunately in these past two years ive trained my mind to always beleive that ill be even better when i return this is no exception this is the third year in a row ill be missing the uso but im not worried or desperate in these four months i proved my class climbing form 136 to 24 ranking im not knocked out by these blows just temporarily stopped
1531468 i cannot prepare well for the uso even though there is still 20 days left when the doctors told me it is not recommended for my health to play in the olympics there is no reason to rush for the uso the olympics are once in four years and there is not better feeling for an athlete than to represent his country when that was gone health became the most important
1531469 the aim is to be ready for the davis cup in zadar we must send the brazilians home and return to the world group thats where we belong
1531470 after 10 days theyll do tests again and i hope to start training lightly as ive already done a couple of times before ill probably go for some high altitude training everything must be 100 percent ok i cannot start again only for something else to go wrong
1531471 i was amazed too great rise in such a short time marseille zagreb and indian wells when i realized i can stand the exertion under the most difficult conditions i gained enormous confidence i played the best in miami and dubrovnik dc i beat murray twice the guy just won cincy it wasnt easy on clay i wasnt satisfied with my performance noticed something missing but i had no luck with the draw i lost to nadal almagro davydenko federer my only failure was probably ginepri in portschach
1531472 the decision about the us open is a tough one you train for grand slams and this year for the olympics and you end up not playing them i can only promise that ill fight as always and there will be an end to my problems thats all
1531473 there is no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis other than treating the symptoms no antiviral drugs or vaccines are available some physicians have prescribed a 5 day course of steroids to control the swelling of the throat and tonsils the use of steroids has also been reported to decrease the overall length and severity of illness but these reports have not been published it is important to note that symptoms related to infectious mononucleosis caused by ebv infection seldom last for more than 4 months when such an illness lasts more than 6 months it is frequently called chronic ebv infection however valid laboratory evidence for continued active ebv infection is seldom found in these patients the illness should be investigated further to determine if it meets the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or cfs this process includes ruling out other causes of chronic illness or fatigue

1531475 hey bud im really proud of you for taking a break before you got too upset that was exactly the right way to handle things
1531476 i had only gotten the salesmans pitch from other sources your blog has put things into perspective i am now able to change my business strategy to fit what is really happening downtown i almost walked away there is way too much positive and local periodicals are nothing but puff pieces if it is too good to be true it just might be thank you
1531477 all i want to know is if i can ever afford this

1531485 with this consortium the field of psychiatry has come together in a way that is unprecedented
1531486 with the understanding that no individual study has enough power to ask these incredibly important questions
1531487 the consortium should be recognized for taking the important first step towards unearthing the full underlying genomic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
1531488 only by doing such a large study could we have uncovered these stunning findings to such a high degree of confidence thus setting the stage for an even more complete understanding of the full genomic contributions to disease
1531489 in this second generation of medical genetics we can use new genomic technologies to look at thousands of patients at a much finer resolution than ever before
1531490 it is encouraging that both research teams identified these same genomic sites
1531491 in light of these new findings there no longer needs to be an argument that this type of variation plays a role in some of the risk
1531492 the task now is to understand how rare structural variation together with other kinds of genetic variation and environmental effects work together to produce schizophrenia
1531493 this wonderful framework has enabled the development of new tools and made them rapidly available
1531494 plink is not only crucial to our studies of psychiatric genetics but because it and other analysis tools are made publicly available they are becoming the international standard for whole genome studies
1531495 just observing one of these events in a patient does not in itself tell you anything about the role of that particular variant in causing that persons disease
1531496 we now have a strong foothold into the genetic architecture of this psychiatric disease

1531782 ive done enough demo paintings and drawings to know that each and every time can be a disaster
1531783 at this point ive learned so much that i dont usually get nervous so you can imagine my confusion when i started my demo at the con this year and watched my hand shaking
1531784 it wasnt from nervousness mind you but from excitement ive done portraits and head studies before in front of hundreds of students but this time it was the comic con and i had decided to do a portrait of hellboy
1531785 i didnt want to just render a still from the movie or copy a mignola drawing i thought to take one of mikes comic panels of a hellboy headshot and using shots taken from the film for lighting blend the two with my own sensibilities and love of the character
1531786 but i wanted it to be right on it had to be mike mignola was two booths away hellboy fans in every corner as well as professional portrait artists wandering the floor so with much eagerness i started sketching the bold black outlines of hellboys mug
1531787 within 15 minutes i was well into slathering cadmium red onto the panel and started to whistle everyone wanted a cool ass portrait and i couldnt let them down
1531788 an hour and a half lots of laughs and a bunch of satisfying strokes of bright color indicating high key lighting later i signed off on my first painting of hellboy i even got an applause that was most satisfying
1531789 later i showed the painting to mike and got a thumbs up its interesting to note that when an artist has created something so popular as mike has the artist has to be able to get to a point where they can let go of the character enough to allow others their own interpretation of the property
1531790 on what page would you say he was captured by the aliens just a rough estimate

1531796 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young but in the back seat yeah they wanna hear it so come on turn it up come on wake up america
1531797 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1531798 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1531799 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1531800 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged

1531874 hes a bad guy obama said referring to iraqi dictator saddam hussein
1531875 i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
1531876 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaeda

1531885 i think that wayne could sit as a very credible reasonably influential independent as a plp mp he would be too beholden to them having to prove his loyalty and never being truly trusted although dr brown likes to have people around him who need to stay in his favour rather than people of principle

1532139 resmed is now well positioned to deliver strong growth in fiscal year 2009
1532140 there is no immediate prospect of an improvement in the highly challenging industry conditions that pacifica is currently experiencing
1532141 consequently pacifica expects to report a further operating loss in the second half of 2008
1532142 there is also no short term expectation of an increase in locally manufactured large passenger car volumes in australia
1532143 in response to the lasting shift in demand towards smaller more fuel efficient cars in the automotive industry pacifica continues to actively pursue initiatives that further improve its capacity utilisation
1532144 approximately 29 million of the sales decline was attributable to the adverse translation effect of a stronger australian dollar with the balance reflecting reduced underlying light truck volumes as consumers responded to the steep rise in petrol prices
1532145 the majority of the sales decrease impacted the knoxville plant where first half volume reductions were exacerbated by the effect of the strike activity at american axle which caused significant disruption to the truck production of pacificas major end customer general motors
1532146 the asian business remains profitable but lower export volumes to north america have served to reduce earnings
1532147 considerable effort is being applied to attracting increased custom from the local market to lift the capacity utilisation of the foundry operation at dalian in china
1532148 increased demand associated with supply to the successful export programs of both gm holden and toyota has offset the continuing decline of large passenger car volumes in the local market

1532154 at the deepest level pride is the choice to exclude both god and other people from their rightful place in our hearts jesus said that the essence of spiritual life is to love god and to love people pride destroys our capacity to love pride moves us to exclude instead of to embrace pride moves us to bow down before a mirror rather than before god pride moves us to judge rather than to serve pride means not only that we want to be smart and wealthy but also that we will not be satisfied until we are smarter and wealthier than those around us pride is essentially comparative in nature

1532166 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1532167 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1532168 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1532169 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1532170 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped

1532184 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1532185 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1532186 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1532187 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information
1532188 the support we received and the money we raised on the night was sensational
1532189 to make such significant inroads into our debt in one night has provided a fantastic start to our debt demolition campaign

1532196 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1532197 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1532198 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1532199 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1532200 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important presidential election campaigns in years
1532201 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1532202 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1532203 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1532204 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1532205 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1532206 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring

1532231 i am very much saddened by your email and felt obligated to reply you in person i cannot justify the cruelty against animals or against any form of life nor i could ask for forgiveness nothing could be more sacred than life itself i am deeply sorrowed we proud humans do always talk about harmonizing with the nature build environmental management systems and certify pretend to be a part of the ecology but still we cannot slow down the most advanced living on earth us from savaging on life life in all forms dog fights bull fights animal testings factory farming the list never ends just within the last decade millions of fowl and cattle were terminated by human hands yet all this is not enough for inhumanity human lives even in the middle of europe are being taken methodically in front of our eyes civilians are killed remotely with the state of the art machinery before they even know they were dying i remember a news broadcast in which the overjoyed reporter was telling about the newly developed missile that could penetrate into deep underground shelters elaborate methods of taking lives even in refuge this hurts this must hurt it does not matter whether we are a part of the civilized world and authorized to criticize or among the contemptible people of developing countries we must stand against the organized reproduction of death defend life against inhumanity without making selections without taking preferences or making excuses unconditionally we have been sharing our house with them for over 20 years we had named them yodi miscia and marcvs but all these names diminish in time they become our son daughter or even sister instead i know the affectionate but helpless look in their lucid eyes the happiness they add to our lives and how something breaks in you when they fly away so i am once again wounded by the pictures which have drawn you to sending an email albeit displayed as concentration camps on the web these dog shelters in question have been first established by the animal lovers initiative with the help of local municipalities my own son was among the many who were carrying food to these shelters but unfortunately the number of four legged guests in the shelters has been increasing geometrically making it almost impossible to give them proper space and care in the cities we animal lovers are very responsible for this increase too sterilization is not a very common practice in our country resulting number of puppies and kittens are more than we can ever look after as a minister i am not directly connected with these severe hurting happenings but as a person as someone who has felt the heartbeats of these babies on his fingertips i take my share from the blame i will try my best to raise funds for these animal shelters and warn those responsible to avoid such sad events i would like to thank you for sharing your doubts with us now we need your support to create a better environment for our friends your corroboration will definitely encourage the volunteers working in these shelters
1532232 is my philosophy subtlety is something that we find less and less of nowadays and its rarity makes it that much more desirable

1532234 the nephilim giants were on the earth in those days and the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were fair and they took wives unto themselves and bore children mighty men of renoun

1532244 theyve lost a husband and father who worked hard to give them the opportunities he did not have but he wont be there to enjoy his childrens success
1532245 the problem had been identified someone had been hurt previously the solution was known and it wasnt fixed until after a man had died the opportunities to make improvements were repeatedly deferred
1532246 this company is successful and should be setting an example by ensuring the highest safety standards are maintained with listed companies now in their reporting season they have the opportunity to transparently report on their health and safety performance for better or worse and to identify what will be done in the future

1532260 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1532261 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1532262 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1532263 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1532264 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1532265 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1532266 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1532267 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1532268 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than
1532269 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1532270 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago

1532285 i wanted to see what would happen if you put a really high powered engine in a chassis
1532286 this a community building that is a symbol of environmental stewardship and energy efficiency and it adds value to the central corridor
1532287 the core of what its about is to really preserve a sense of the irish culture here in minnesota
1532288 paying a little bit of homage to the ancestors and recognizing there are immigrants today and do something symbolic by making donations to their cultural activities in the twin cities
1532289 its a cultural festival that attracts well beyond the heritage circle
1532290 people connect to it and enjoy it in many ways
1532291 lesamay and thisisdeadair tv are the new sue johanson of the internet the show is cutting edge sexy and informative thisisdeadair tv is truly leading the way in sexual health sexual knowledge and more importantly sexual fun
1532292 i thought after you see a few youd see a stop sign very differently
1532293 the goal is to make people more aware of their surroundings not to be a disturbance
1532294 we are not dealing with wholesale fragmentation the marketplace is jelling
1532295 i think unification is a very good thing and that its happening
1532296 limos role is to bring this all together so it can all happen efficiently
1532297 what were trying to do is kick start greater innovation were trying to embrace all companies
1532298 is a techno geeky way to say flexible glitch free audio
1532299 the redesigned pulseaudio automatically adjusts the way it feeds audio data to accommodate system load and ensure the audio data is always ready when needed
1532300 somewhat one size fits all design that was not nearly as flexible
1532301 the way audio data flowed could be affected to a much greater degree by particular hardware devices or audio software applications
1532302 allows the administrator of a system to use either a command line or a graphical interface to select any of a number of different tests that detect misconfigurations or anomalies on a given system
1532303 any of a number of scripting languages such as the bash shell python or perl making it completely extensible
1532304 the past players were sensational and it was great to see some of the old faces back here it was a bit of a theatrical event and they had to get into the spirit of it
1532305 garry lyon spoke really well and fired them up at the start and singer david hobson was terrific it takes a lot to make something like this successful but everyone kicked in from the staff and the board and theyve all kicked on until the end
1532306 it is about being aware of the responsibility that we carry and at this time more than any in our history we need to be making the right decisions there is the passion and business acumen in this room that brings this club together and thats what we showed tonight
1532307 its a start were into the second quarter now of our debt demolition
1532308 it is with a heavy heart that i announce my retirement from football
1532309 st kilda football club has been my life for over 20 years but after discussions between myself and the club i have come to the realisation that it is the right time to move on
1532310 while roberts career can be remembered by his outstanding individual accolades i think most will remember him as a selfless team player who did whatever it took for the saints to be successful
1532311 when you look at the best and fairests the brownlows its self evident how good he is
1532312 he stands equal with the greatest midfielders in the game
1532313 these songs were designed like the fear factory songs that raymond and i always wrote however weve been able to push the boundaries and go out of that context while remaining heavy
1532314 christian and ray have been writing together for many years so the music does have a lot of fear factory elements
1532315 however weve been open to trying different things it basically fuses what i have been doing vocally in threat signal with driving fear factory rhythms along with some of our own experimentation the idea behind the project is to be heavy but maintain melody at the same time
1532316 theres been a number of things that our first party worldwide studios have looked at and theyve been trying to look at different options
1532317 well yes i think it is i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool but you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment
1532318 making an instruction manual telling teens how to drink and do drugs or have sex were just laying out how it is
1532319 my character is very conflicted and even in the episodes where hes having sex then dumping girls theres often regret
1532320 you know there are repercussions to certain sorts of behavior that come full circle
1532321 i never actually said i disliked having my top off it was just that on that occasion it didnt make sense
1532322 nate was supposed to be waking up hungover on his buddys couch so why would he be in his boxer shorts
1532323 i dont actually mind taking my clothes off most of the time its why i go to the gym
1532324 but right now i couldnt ask for more and i certainly never complain about it
1532325 i guess some people assume theres a seed of truth to it people think where theres smoke theres fire
1532326 i just dont even want to speculate on that its just one of those things that rolls off my back
1532327 theres not one seed of truth to it so itll just go away in the end
1532328 everyone was having a good time lindsay and sam were very comfortable with the group around you can tell theyre so in love
1532329 lindsay seemed to really fit in it seemed like everyone really likes her
1532330 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1532331 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1532332 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1532333 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
1532334 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
1532335 we need to get an exact sense of the decision
1532336 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1532337 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1532338 i do say things that i think will shock people but i dont do things to shock people im not trying to be the next tupac but i dont know how long im going to be on this planet so while im here i might as well make the most of it
1532339 listen you have been doing things for other people all your life taking care of them and putting your life on hold you really need to figure out what you want who you are and where you want to be screw what everyone else wants from you he even added himself into the equation and focus on yourself
1532340 omg is that a government van can they hear us shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
1532341 i wanted to come home different from what id been bolder wiser happier

1532343 consideramos muy positivo este encuentro creo que fue una reuni n muy franca hemos podido abordar muchos temas
1532344 todos los temas se pueden acordar con voluntad de di logo
1532345 ha sido positiva porque nos abre una instancia de di logo que es el espacio que ven amos pretendiendo
1532346 hay que buscar la forma de que productores medianos y peque os tengan retenciones diferenciadas esto qued instalado

1532348 i now had a vast quantity of paper at my disposal and i set about filling the notebooks with odd facts stories from the past and all sorts of other things including the most trivial material on the whole i concentrated on things and people that i found charming and splendid
1532349 potential for extreme fire behavior due to low live and dead fuel moistures persistent drought sudden oak death and elevated fire danger rating values across much of the state particularly at elevations below 5 500 feet
1532350 firing burning in steeply dissected terrain with heavy fuels have exhibited rapid rates of spread and erratic fire underfavorable weather conditions the extraordinary number of acres that have burned so far this summer highlights how aggressively fireas have been behaving
1532351 localized sudden oak death sod has affected a number of oak species in southern california fire behavior in these areas is often more intense due to increased fuel loading these fuelbeds are very receptive to spotting
1532352 as if there arent enough lawyers out there inventing lawsuits now were going to invite the public to do so
1532353 i think this is nothing more than a referral service
1532354 it encourages if not creates lawsuits our countrys courts are clogged with unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits which delay if not obstruct the access to courts of people that really need to get there that have serious legal grievances
1532355 with our system they can either find a lawyer or find out by talking to our lawyers that they dont really have an interest in that case
1532356 i dont think whocanisue com is going to by itself increase the number of lawsuits there are but it may make people more aware of what their rights are
1532357 its a good thing to the extent people are vindicating their legal rights to the extent they didnt years ago
1532358 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
1532359 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1532360 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1532361 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1532362 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
1532363 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
1532364 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
1532365 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
1532366 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them
1532367 when we first came here al qaeda spread rumors that we were here to occupy the city and that we are shiite and were going to treat the residents badly but then the people started to realize that we were dealing with them in a professional way
1532368 the most significant aspect of the awakening movement in samarra is the fact that its members come from all of the major tribes in the city
1532369 all iraqis are focusing on the shrine it was a symbol and the shrine is part of the reconciliation process
1532370 after two months it will be ramadan and we will invite many more
1532371 we are trying to re build the relationship between both sides
1532372 the biggest concern now is unemployment because it directly affects the security situation
1532373 ninety percent of the people lost their jobs as a result of the bombing
1532374 when someone finds himself without work for three years hell do anything for money even setting off explosions or killing people
1532375 unemployment is high we apply for jobs with the police and they reject us
1532376 how could you secure the town without the people of the town
1532377 each commander has his own people who he has already picked they bring their own people from najaf balad and karbala
1532378 listen to me if youre angry about power just know there are some other areas where people are buying their water

1532435 until we can take a freshman class and go through all four years and win consistently
1532436 hell take the open receiver but if things break down thats when hes really effective
1532437 im hoping those guys will certainly set the tone for what we do in the running game
1532438 its outrageous ridiculous its a wonder anyone can go anywhere
1532439 the price of gas seems to be encapsulating the concern about the economy as a whole
1532440 it is a nice easy reference point everybody has to buy gas for their car or pay their fuel bill
1532441 i believe that mccain believes it makes him appear more decisive that we have to be more responsible for our energy by drilling for more oil and building more power plants
1532442 i know how much the auto industry and the auto workers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so
1532443 but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan china but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan
1532444 it is not a real answer to the problem its a good idea to help with the economy until we can come up with something more permanent
1532445 we wont even see that for 10 years if were going to look that long term then we should be thinking about alternative fuels
1532446 nine months out of the year i dont even know what gas prices are
1532447 your name is marte you have great powers only some of which you have as yet discovered
1532448 i would suggest that a minority of people have hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs that we are using on patrol
1532449 we are very very worried about the intentions of a number of hardcore protesters which we believe are around 150 who are committed to using criminal means to achieve their aims
1532450 yesterday we were frustrated by the police behaviour today we are disgusted this is an entirely peaceful event the very suggestion that we have weapon stashes isnt just ridiculous it is offensive
1532451 we are here to run workshops and debates to demonstrate sustainable living and take peaceful action against the coal fired power station we wont be distracted by this preposterous smear campaign
1532452 it is absolutely essential that ambulances fire engines and police vehicles can get on and off the site in case of emergency and that the site can be evacuated if the need arises
1532453 we will not compromise on safety we are obliged under law to do all that we can in our power so emergency services can have access to a community of 1 000 people and this is why we have needed to act so access is available
1532454 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1532455 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1532456 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1532457 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1532458 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1532459 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning

1532463 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited

1532465 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
1532466 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited
1532467 we have found no further evidence regarding st johns high school so this is a very critical factor in this investigation to try to determine what the purpose was by these two young men by acquiring very dangerous weapons and chemicals

1532478 i can hardly name an area where choice is needed more
1532479 its no big secret that the client side of the it environment is one of the last bastions of proprietary technology disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1532480 we have long believed that helping to bring openness and choice to the client desktop is one of the next things to explode in this whole march for linux
1532481 the problem is for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
1532482 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
1532483 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
1532484 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac
1532485 but for the typical environments windows apps are too pervasive and entrenched for a switch to make economic sense
1532486 new york is an amazingly resilient city with resilient people and i have great faith in the future of our city said sanford i weill chairman and chief executive officer of citigroup
1532487 in the near term we must develop a comprehensive blueprint for downtowns future and quickly restore its infrastructure weill said
1532488 we also must tell the world that new york city is open for business and tourism and we need federal help to accomplish all this
1532489 that this cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells jeffs when a girl is ready to get married and that he is only following the word of heavenly father
1532490 we agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic
1532491 the 1918 pandemic is considered to be and clearly is something unique and its widely understood to be the most lethal natural event that has occurred in recent human history
1532492 we still see many more overweight patients than underweight but its a challenge
1532493 we have to convince overweight people not to eat as much and underweight people to increase their caloric intake
1532494 its vital women know that pregnancy is no time to be starving yourself
1532495 during the nine months it is in the womb the baby is growing faster than it ever will in later life
1532496 what we expect is that whenever possible women should have a physical before they get pregnant that way they can be evaluated for risk factors such as being overweight or underweight
1532497 being overweight can lead to complications such as diabetes and being underweight can lead to problems such as low birth weight
1532498 we recommend to women that rather than going on a diet while pregnant they should consult a registered dietician and have a plan tailored to fit their needs
1532499 they mjc came to us and said were going to do it close the barns unless you pay us to keep it open its like someone walking into a bank with a pistol and you give him the key and say here you can have everything thats in the vault there is nothing in the vault
1532500 what are we going to use for money wed have to use purse money and if we did that wed have to cut the purses and no one would run in our races so what good would it do to have stabling with no races
1532501 i dont want to influence the vote of the commission
1532502 but the mjc and magna and the thoroughbred horsemen are doing horribly this is probably something that has to give
1532503 but this could be the death knell people will leave and not come back they can go to pennsylvania and run for bigger purses in easier races its unfortunate for the state
1532504 i have not heard anything about cutting back the dates from the mjc or the horsemen they have to come forward with the date request in november but i do not believe anyone will make a formal presentation until after the nov 4 slots referendum vote
1532505 my hope and desire would be that the referendum passes and the legislature would give us an advance on the revenue to carry us to 2010
1532506 the nilotic negroes who live in extreme heat particularly in summer may turn out to be the worlds leanest people

1532513 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1532514 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1532515 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1532516 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1532517 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1532518 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1532519 we have to do all the investigation to make sure nothing else could have happened
1532520 at 6 45 in the evening theres got to be more witnesses
1532521 and were not concerned that they did not come forward immediately some may think what they witnessed is insignificant but that may not be the case
1532522 that may change when they see hillary campaign for obama
1532523 one western official who had seen the letter said it added absolutely nothing

1532529 best scenario was to be a witness he seized the opportunity to be that witness and wasnt charged with the death penalty he was also provided information that he incorporated into his stories
1532530 on the surface no thing other than a natural father and daughter relationship between the defendant and his daughter
1532531 best scenario was to be a witness he seized the opportunity to be that witness and wasnt charged with the death penalty he was also provided information that he incorporated into his stories

1532535 i had to complete it i did want that degree and im going to hang it up on the wall in my living room
1532536 i would argue that someone without roslyns training may not have had that relationship with people who she was looking to support
1532537 so here i am with my children they are all successful in my eyes and i think in the worlds eyes i think ive really done quite well and i want to thank you for this special occasion

1532543 we believe that unison on ubuntu is a killer app for linux and a great option for any small or medium business it is more powerful and far more affordable than the microsoft alternative with the user friendliness and wide distribution of ubuntu we expect this partnership to further accelerate the growth of both linux in business it as well as unified communications
1532544 unison is a solution that makes unified communications simple and affordable on linux we are happy to partner with unison technologies and spread the word that linux offers a superior platform for business it now including unified communications
1532545 they reduce their it management and costs at the same time as boosting productivity by as much as 15 we expect to see a rapid adoption of unison as companies realize the enormous benefits they can gain with relatively little cost
1532546 most of the flawed onions it breaks my heart to throw them away because they are only cosmetically compromised there must be someway to use them
1532547 its taking a product that was once common and making it extraordinary
1532548 thats value added thats using products from a farm in a new and high value way
1532549 our student bistro concept is exactly that touch base with the states farmers and connecting and plugging those products into our menu
1532550 chinese factories reported a plunge in new orders last month exports are barely growing the real estate market is weakening
1532551 if one ignores a certain protocol then it becomes impossible to communicate on that particular channel
1532552 the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
1532553 how do we unleash that energy that has been locked in that power system thats embodied in the federal reserve

1532558 personalmente si me gustaria hacer otra movie de doom ya que la pasada estuvo fenomenal aprendimos dos que tres lecciones y la mejor manera de hacer las cosas mejor es a trav s de la experiencia
1532559 vamos a ver que pasa cuando estemos en desarrollo con el juego que queremos que vaya acorde a la cinta y donde les diremos un poco m s para que haya m s expectativas a mayor expectativa los chicos de la universal podr an comenzar a hacer las cosas
1532560 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1532561 in the states its an established economy you cant create another apple you cant create another microsoft you cant really create another disney
1532562 im stepping away from that salary that comfortable stable environment where you have power all the time you have water all the time but here i can create the lifestyle i want
1532563 i was following all this from london and started to believe now was the time to start planning to come back
1532564 there was a sense of patriotism i have always regarded myself as nigerian and planned to return to nigeria eventually
1532565 i think theres a window that will be there for maybe another 18 months to two years
1532566 thats the view at the moment that people moving back understand exotic products but it will percolate to the local sector and people will learn these things and there wont be any need to drag investment bankers from new york or london
1532567 when you see the hustle on the streets of lagos all those traders selling all those products you know the street works
1532568 you formalise distribution in nigeria today its a billion dollar business because everybody needs distribution everybodys got products
1532569 you get up in the morning and you see all of lagos on the move young boys trying to make ends meet its an eye opener
1532570 there are issues its not valhalla were not in miltons paradise yet
1532571 but i believe in nigeria im positive about this country
1532572 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet i mean i cannot even imagine how much that is but it is a lot
1532573 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1532574 the other aspect is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1532575 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1532576 the fact that we are prominent individuals from all parts of africa if we strongly disagree with someone i think we can mobilize shame against that person
1532577 some countries appeared to ignore the problem south africa could have done more and they havent
1532578 what we have lacked is sufficient visibility of leadership just as my own country was mired in ghastly nightmare of president mbekis aids denialism president mogae in botswana was rolling out very scientific responses
1532579 what really worries me is new infections we have set for ourselves a target of no new infections by 2016
1532580 i take it all because they look for me to be a big part of it
1532581 i wasnt mentally in it so i did lose some gap responsibility and all my true effort wasnt out there i thought i was but when i watch film it really wasnt like i was the year before so i take responsibility and put it on myself
1532582 it put me behind a big rock because i wasnt doing cardio like i should and conditioning so i kind of got behind in my workouts and stuff
1532583 terdell two years ago before i was here had a good year and did some really good things and his weight was down and he was going the right direction and he was rewarded with a big contract
1532584 last year he went through some family issues and didnt deal with them very well and his weight went as high as it has ever been and he did not have a very good year at all
1532585 his weight is down as low as its been since ive been here not as low as it was two years ago
1532586 but he has a good bounce to his step and hes practicing harder and i just think he feels healthier he has some issues in his family behind him and hes moving forward and hes focused on football we need him to help because hes a dominant run player at times if we could get him to ever do that at a consistent level it would be an exciting thing
1532587 for the most part the league considers the players to be fungible products
1532588 but lebron is one of the three or four players the league would definitely hate to lose if a team lost him or kobe bryant to europe it would lose its mind it would be devastating
1532589 it would be disappointing to lose one of our star players but i have no concern at all about the best players playing anywhere but in the nba for a long time to come
1532590 id be surprised if one of our top players chose to go to europe but if it did happen there are many players who would step up and fill the void
1532591 we sent him back for an mri cat scan and hes all clean and good as far as thats concerned
1532592 just a little bit of pressing on the nerve right now weve got to alleviate that before we can get him back out into rehab on one hand theres a delay in the process but the prognosis is good and well go from there

1532600 these guys were in first place before i got here
1532601 i feel like usually im probably the loud one before the game but in no way shape or form am i on this team
1532602 i came up as a second hitter so i really wasnt thinking about home runs it just happened
1532603 even now the main thing is getting guys over and getting them in its not hitting the ball out of the ballpark but that is what people are fascinated with is the home runs
1532604 when i had the initial conversation with him i explained we were not asking you to be our everyday center fielder were only asking you to go out there when you feel great
1532605 i dont think id rather do something else at this point in my life
1532606 if you look at quite a few other clubs theyve not been able to bring in as many players as we have at this point
1532607 at this time of year everyone has expectations and people will look at the situation and make their own minds up
1532608 our job is to try and fulfil all the promise weve got in the squad because with everyone fit weve got a strong group of players
1532609 theres still some work to do but im really looking forward to the start of the season we might not do as well as we think we can but thats the fascination of a season
1532610 its a very tough league but were optimistic and at this stage the fans should be as well theres no reason why we cant have our dreams
1532611 i dont see why not the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
1532612 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
1532613 there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
1532614 in the last three or four years it has been chelsea and
1532615 you can see from our results in europe how much quality there is in the so i expect us all to be quite close to each other
1532616 a lot of people say that i should have gone to united instead but i had already had two meetings with juventus before united came in
1532617 this cartilage thing is going to slow him down a little bit and hes disappointed about it
1532618 but hes matured quite a bit and hell be able to handle it if he can handle two patellar tendons on the same play he can handle a piece of cartilage that they take out of the knee
1532619 the current shape of football in bulgaria is a reflection of the current state of the country so unfortunately such things the cska case are happening
1532620 we have to accept that we cant be a soccer powerhouse when we are still a way behind the leading european countries in political and economic terms
1532621 our clubs cant compare at the moment to the ones that play in the biggest leagues in europe so its not a surprise that they are fulfilling the requests more slowly they just cant afford to do it quickly they dont have the financial power
1532622 but the most important thing is that were going in the right direction we reacted by taking all the necessary steps and were trying to help clubs to implement conditions set by uefa
1532623 yes we handed out a stadium ban but we see that the clubs realise their mistakes and have the will to make amends
1532624 well fans want to go to a modern stadium and watch players like ronaldinho and so do i but it just cant happen with a magic wand we have to be patient and go step by step
1532625 all stadiums have passed stringent safety tests and we handed ban to those places presenting risk to the crowd we didnt make any compromise but we assured clubs that we can be partners and we would be always happy to help
1532626 im pleased to say that finally clubs sports bodies and institutions agreed to join forces and condemn the fan violence and to distance ourselves from racism
1532627 the bfu turned to the government and to the police for help to eradicate the problem but i know it will take time in fact the hardest thing was to convince the institutions that this is an extremely serious problem
1532628 we now have a very strict law on violence at sports events and all we need is a will to implement it and punish the perpetrators
1532629 i will say we are looking for another starting pitcher
1532630 both the jury and judge sleet have recognized and upheld our fundamental right to set and make changes to the atp tour calendar changes that are necessary if we are to unlock the full potential of our sport
1532631 their decision also supports atps position that this process of change was undertaken in a transparent vigorous and good faith manner
1532632 these are exciting times for mens professional tennis with the atp set to unveil the largest set of changes to the tour since its inception in 1990
1532633 if somebodys not here we just move on if somebody gets hurt we move on
1532634 tyler has some things he needs to take care of
1532635 weve got great players at quarterback because everybody wants to come and play quarterback here
1532636 all participants in the ietf are there as individuals not as companies or representatives thereof whether this is a quaint fiction is an interesting discussion given enough beer but it is certainly the historical basis of the organization
1532637 when you reach home youre patted on the back and guys that cant reach your back are reaching across and hitting you in the head
1532638 if you throw the helmet off theyre not going to hit you in the head it eases cerebral damage
1532639 when i was coming home and i saw all the guys i thought im not keeping it so i threw it away
1532640 they still punch you in the ribs and do other stuff but wont hit you in the head as hard
1532641 its the same thing whether a base hit or homer they run to you and hit you in the helmet and jump with you
1532642 its exciting too taking the helmet off and throwing it away
1532643 if you read an article in the 1980s it said a homer was a game ending homer it probably wasnt until the late 90s and early 2000s when the statistic came into vogue
1532644 every baseball fan notices the flipping of helmets and knows the reason the pounding on the helmet is worse than the pounding on the head
1532645 i run on the field and go nuts on the guy jump on him
1532646 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season
1532647 i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1532648 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one
1532649 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1532650 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected
1532651 but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well
1532652 the culture of our society today is surely oriented toward getting a lot done and slowing things down and being polite is part of this campaign
1532653 like for example here on 24th where you have a very popular bike path and where they have to cross the roadway and they have to cross in the marked crosswalk
1532654 i think sort of reckless abandon going across the street and just sort of demanding respect is not a very good way to get it
1532655 i think we all need reminders at times to be safe on the roadway because of the consequences that happen
1532656 delay in a business process that results when human interaction or intervention is required
1532657 the time it takes for workers to move from one communications channel say email to another one say the telephone to respond to whatever issue they have to deal with
1532658 because uc involves making contact with and responding to people the real value of uc will have to be found at the communication end points this means looking at the flexibility and efficiency of user interfaces for communication and the devices that support such interfaces to make people an efficient part of time sensitive work flow processes regardless of their location and environment
1532659 rather than guessing about the availability of the person to take a phone call presence information and im communication allow the contact initiator to check for accessibility to a call recipient and request permission via im to make a call before blindly making a call attempt
1532660 i need to sit in on this conference whats the bridge number
1532661 these things there has never been a timetable if you have a timetable you set yourself up for disappointment i am going to be very pleased when it does happen in the meantime i will focus on the guys that are here and this tennessee trip and it will all work out
1532662 if jacksons not here when we have our first week of practice for the philly game i would be pretty concerned
1532663 i dont foresee that i dont think anybody knows when its going to happen i am very confident it will
1532664 wi fi cellular convergence to let your cell phone call over a wlan or cellular network is more complicated
1532665 its hard to find agreement on what the term fmc even means or on how it relates to the even more confusing term of unified communications
1532666 fmc is going to cost money and make the wireless network much more complicated you have to become in effect a carrier and you have to engineer your wlan for a new metric call capacity
1532667 mobile carriers generally are reluctant to do anything that drains revenue from cellular minutes so dont look for them to push fmc down your throat
1532668 to scale this up to the enterprise you have to create a pbx in the sky and surround it with policies that allow the employee to use the handset for personal and business tasks while automatically and reliably separating the charges accordingly

1532670 elections are fake burlington is one of the more radical
1532671 we are preparing the flights of our strategic aircraft to the indian ocean to practice interoperability with the russian navy task force in the region
1532672 since august 2007 russian strategic bombers have carried out about 150 patrol flights with tactical interference of foreign aircraft which accompanied our planes on their missions and in some instances jeopardized the success of these missions
1532673 texas nonprofit and open source communities are obvious partners but they dont always make the connection penguin day austin will demystify the technology for the nonprofit participants and help bring those communities together
1532674 nonprofit organizations are in need of specific software to manage volunteers raise funds and mobilize their constituents open source software can be less costly for these groups we convene penguin days to challenge software developers to provide flexible and useful open source software penguin days also empower nonprofits to communicate their needs and be active partners in the use of open source technology
1532675 i forecast a collapse a collapse of our health care system
1532676 since 1999 and the highest was in year 2003 we exported 30 000 nurses a year so just in a span of like four years we exported a hundred thousand nurses
1532677 the salary is 4 000 dollars a month in the u s and in the philippines a nurse will only get 180 to 220 per month
1532678 simple i just want to pursue my dreams i want to earn and maybe have a better life
1532679 when i interview nurses who are about to be hired
1532680 i ask them if they have plans to go abroad and they always say yes
1532681 thats a lie i worked there before for 2 yrs salary is too low im now in australia salary is better
1532682 as long as hospitals feel they have access to an unlimited pool of foreign nurses there is much less pressure to address problems in the working environment
1532683 the inability of our members to bring highly educated workers into the united states severely hurts their ability to compete in the global market
1532684 hospitals dont usually compensate foreign nurses for their experience from abroad
1532685 you might get a nurse with 10 years of experience but you dont pay her for the experience
1532686 theres been a lot of legislation to create new nurses but so far its been a lot of talk with no teeth resulting in a lot of unfunded mandates
1532687 nurses in the philippines now are no longer of the same quality as the nurses five to 10 years back
1532688 they literally do not report to the hospitals especially those with immigrant status those who report act as if they are not there because theyre busy doing other things
1532689 there are more nursing schools now and so many nursing graduates they schools have become mere diploma mills
1532690 were in the process of conducting a tracking survey of the vacancy rate in our hospitals and we can definitely see there is going to be a shortage
1532691 used to nurses went to the hospitals to work now there are so many more opportunities outside of the hospital
1532692 my experience is that you can offer all the money in the world but if the work experience is not a positive one then its not going to matter
1532693 its a very difficult job and we have to continually think about what we can do to make their job as easy as we can
1532694 if you want to work a certain shift weve probably got it we offer 6 8 10 or 12 hours shifts whatever it takes
1532695 if you had to pick one major problem at least in my opinion it would be the lack of qualified nursing faculty for the nursing schools throughout the state
1532696 regardless of the number of students wanting to enter nursing there wont be enough faculty to teach them the students wont be able to get in because the schools wont be able to teach all of them
1532697 were now taking in about 70 students per year where we were typically having 35 to 40 students in a year
1532698 one of the things were trying to do at our school is to bring on some part time and clinical instructors with bachelors degree
1532699 they have great experience and were trying to bring them in and mentor them and encourage them to go back and get the advanced degrees
1532700 there has to be some equity for all faculty in the different disciplines
1532701 in the fall we had 130 applicants for 50 positions
1532702 the lowest grade point average we have is a 3 4
1532703 our students are very aware of the salaries and they know that with their jobs they can go anywhere in the country and work
1532704 back in the fall of 2004 we hired 25 nurses from the philippines we got five of them over before the country ran out of visa numbers to allow workers into the united states

1532715 they the jewish terrorists took us to the village graveyard they lined us up in several rows a jewish commander came and ordered his troops to pick ten they did and the chosen ten were lined up beside the cactus plants and were shot they came back and chose another ten to remove the bodies of the murdered ten and then they themselves were killed
1532716 oh how i wish i was also shot that day it would have been much easier than living with the pain all these years
1532717 we were awakened in the middle of the night by heavy gun fire

1532719 they sorted them out the women and children on one side the men on the other
1532720 on the beach the soldiers led groups of men away and you could hear gun fire after each departure towards noon we were led on foot to an orchard to the east of the village and i saw bodies piled on a cart pulled by men of tantura who emptied their cargo in a big pit then trucks arrived and women and children were loaded onto them and driven to furaydis on the road near the railroad tracks other bodies were scattered about
1532721 that which is lawful is clear and that which is unlawful is clear between the two are doubtful matters that few people have knowledge about whoever avoids these doubtful matters absolves himself of blame with respect to his religion and his honor whoever falls into doubtful things will fall into what is unlawful just like the shepherd who grazes his flock too close to a private pasture is liable to have some of his flock stray into it every king has a private pasture and allahs private pasture is what he has prohibited verily in the body is a small piece of flesh that if it is healthy the whole body is healthy and if it is sick the whole body is sick this small piece of flesh is the heart

1532727 en lo particular no me gusta que convoquen jugadores que no son mexicanos por nacimiento
1532728 no puedo platicar de mi etapa como t cnico porque fue muy mala pero sigo pensando de la misma manera
1532729 estamos bien en el nimo fue un golpe duro dif cil pero ya pas el equipo siempre tiene personalidad para salir de sta hay que darle la vuelta a la p gina y corregir las cosas que estamos haciendo mal
1532730 hay que seguir trabajando m s duro ahora lo m s imporante es que nos mantenemos unidos y se ha visto que siempre en las adversidades el equipo ha sabido salir adelante
1532731 cuando jugamos mal aceptamos las cr ticas agachamos la cabeza somos los primeros en hacerlas cuando jugamos mal pero el segundo tiempo fue el peor que hemos jugado hay que seguir trabajando lo importante es que todos estamos bien
1532732 que por los antecedentes del deportista se deber a estudiar m s el caso y la sanci n
1532733 la medida descarta pr cticamente a noraldo de los ol mpicos l todav a tiene un camino que es el de apelar pero personalmente creo que es un tema muy dif cil para su participaci n en los ol mpicos ser a poco conveniente
1532734 lo importante es empezar con un grupo de jugadores que para nosotros son los mejores que tenemos aqu en el mbito local
1532735 los jugadores vienen con la ilusi n y cada uno tiene que darle la importancia a este proceso lo importante es que haya qu mica y comunicaci n entre el cuerpo t cnico y los jugadores
1532736 ahora los equipos se marchan fuera a trabajar y eso tiene sus pros y sus contras creo que en m xico fuimos in crescendo
1532737 eso no se puede tener con el schalke ni con cualquier conjunto hoy nos hicieron dos goles y luego tuvieron dos ocasiones m s no hay rival peque o te relajas con 2 0 y te pueden hacer da o
1532738 la ventaja que hemos tenido ha sido los desplazamientos que han sido cortos pero al final lo que cuenta es estar bien el 13 y el 27
1532739 estoy contrariado porque estoy lesionado me lastim la mano izquierda y la derecha s que voy a ser suspendido pero no por cinco d as quiz tres o dos juegos estoy de acuerdo con eso pero pienso que cinco juegos es mucho
1532740 mi club de pelota est pasando por un momento bastante duro en este momento y debo estar con ellos al 100 abandono mi club por dos d as
1532741 este equipo puede jugar sin m creo en mis entrenadores creo en mi club no pienso que este equipo jugar diferente teni ndome aqu o no

1532747 creo que le da estatus internacional adem s de ser ya reconocido en todo el orbe
1532748 quiz de quien no tenemos referencias es de un par de competidores que clasificaron de la zona asi tica donde desafortunadamente no pudimos conseguir im genes de ese torneo
1532749 creo que los dos equipos vienen bien pues ganar de visitantes cambia el panorama los dos llegan con su estilo pues lograron sacar adelante sus partidos por lo que hay las condiciones para que se d un buen encuentro
1532750 nosotros tenemos que hacer valer nuestra condici n de locales para sacar el triunfo
1532751 en este equipo corren todos pues todos son muy buenos jugadores adem s de que tambi n contamos con buenos prospectos que comienzan a probarse en el futbol mexicano y todos est n con muchas ganas y no se sienten menos que las estrellas de otros equipos
1532752 entre la liga brasile a y la copa sudamericana prefiero la competici n nacional que adem s nos da acceso a la copa libertadores la otra no tiene recompensa
1532753 el rival es un equipo que pelea el bal n como si fuera el ltimo no han ganado y eso los hace m s peligroso va a meter la pierna en cada jugada y nosotros debemos hacer lo mismo pero adem s hacer buen futbol para sacar el resultado sumar tres puntos y meternos en la pelea dentro del grupo
1532754 nosotros sabemos que necesitamos ganar y hacer bien las cosas lo que ocurra al rival no debe preocuparnos el t cnico salvador reyes decidir c mo jugarles y ya estando en la cancha nosotros trataremos de hacer lo mejor
1532755 porque ya necesitamos sumar para aspirar a los primeros lugares afortunadamente en el grupo todos estamos metidos apenas est comenzando esto as que hay que ganar
1532756 respetamos al rival un equipo que acaba de ascender que tambi n trata en cada partido sumar pero nosotros vamos por el triunfo como en cada encuentro nos urgen los tres puntos
1532757 este equipo tiene que trabajar siempre as siempre lo hace quiz contra pumas quedamos a deber no tuvimos tanto sacrificio nosotros partimos de mucha entrega

1532760 ya estamos con el convenio de que vamos a cambiarlo para las 7 19 00 horas el juego ante tecos por la fecha cuatro ya nada m s lo estamos formalizando que nos manden la autorizaci n por escrito
1532761 no desecha ni confirma nada solamente estoy tranquilo y concentrado con el equipo
1532762 en ning n momento hubo algo formal solamente hubo rumores y mi deseo obviamente es en alg n momento jugar en esa liga probar en mis sue os jugar en europa pero con tranquilidad no desecho nada ni confirm nada estoy tranquilo en atlas
1532763 la sensaci n amarga y fea que nos deja el perder m s como se dio el partido en los ltimos 15 minutos son cosas que hay que replantearse pero no hay que perder de vista lo bueno que ha sido ste equipo para mantenerse
1532764 no fue por dar o fueron por muchas circunstancias y dentro de esas est la expulsi n fueron errores puntuales y dentro de esos errores tambi n estuvo la expulsi n que nos perjudic
1532765 la estrategia consisti en emplear al plantel completo a fin de encontrar el ritmo apropiado durante el encuentro a fin de explorar todas sus variantes y estar preparados a fondo en el duelo ante puerto rico el cual ser dif cil

1532769 by partnering and supporting the clean tech open we are establishing a living linkage between the premier r amp d scientists and engineers at the national labs and the engines of entrepreneurship needed for rapid commercialization of clean energy building technologies
1532770 the doe and its national labs have been valuable partners for us since the very beginning
1532771 the power of public private collaboration in encouraging technological innovation in buildings or any other clean technology sector should not be underestimated we have seen the results ourselves through the success of our entrants

1532781 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1532782 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1532783 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1532784 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation

1532818 theres a positive and negative to not being a household name
1532819 the positive is that it gives him the opportunity to frame anew who he is and what hes all about a vision for the future the negative is that other than helping him in virginia and in some battleground states because of his jewishness he doesnt have a proven national brand
1532820 regardless of what mccain decides cantor has a very bright future ahead of him
1532821 he is an appealing and articulate leader for jewish republicans and all republicans as the gop continues to make inroads in the jewish community it is a wonderful moment to introduce this rising star to a wider audience
1532822 at a time when many jewish voters who voted democratic in the past are going to look carefully between john mccain and barack obama on middle east and economic issues eric cantor can add a real boost to what i already believe will be a significant hard look by jewish voters at john mccain
1532823 there is no doubt in my mind that the american jewish community is going to register an unprecedented number of votes for the republicans and mr mccain
1532824 congressman cantor has an excellent relationship with jews who are engaged in campaign finance activities whether as republican jewish coalition leaders aipac leaders or as jewish federation stalwarts
1532825 eric cantor is out of step with the values and views of the vast majority of the american jewish community
1532826 whether the issue is separation of church and state womens reproductive rights stem cell research health care or the environment eric cantor votes wrong
1532827 hardly anyone outside the political elites in the jewish community knows who eric cantor is
1532828 the more people know about him the less theyll like him
1532829 but its something we can disagree about based on jewish learning

1532834 when i began to realize how often we quarreled how often i picked on her with nervous irritation i became aware that our love was doomed love had turned into a love affair with a beginning and an end i could name the very moment when it had begun and one day i knew i should be able to name the final hour when she left the house i couldnt settle to work i would reconstruct what we had said to each other i would fan myself into anger or remorse and all the time i knew i was forcing the pace i was pushing pushing the only thing i loved out of my life as long as i could make believe that love lasted i was happy i think i was even good to live with and so love did last but if love had to die i wanted it to die quickly it was as though our love were a small creature caught in a trap and bleeding to death i had to shut my eyes and wring its neck

1532850 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1532851 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1532852 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1532853 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1532854 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1532855 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010

1532871 the demonic appears most terrible when it assumes dominance in some one person they are not always the most admirable persons either in mind or in gifts but a tremendous force goes out from them and they exercise an unbelievable power over all creatures it is in vain that the brighter part of mankind tries to throw suspicion on them as betrayers or betrayed the masses are attracted by them

1532886 creio que o diploma j foi importante mas n o mais as escolas de comunica o precisam vender qualidade e n o reserva de mercado para um determinado profissional
1532887 se a exig ncia do diploma acabasse amanh os cursos de comunica o continuariam iguais os cursos que fazem a diferen a dentro da forma o desse profissional continuam formando profissionais de qualidade o que muda e o que acaba s o os cursos que realmente vendiam apenas o diploma

1532889 nuestro reto est en darnos cuenta de que juntar comunicaci n y periodismo es juntar dos cosas que hoy d a tienen muy poco que ver porque del periodismo se puede hacer una historia muy corta a trav s de dos modelos por un lado est el de periodismo como espacio de debate propio del siglo xix y por otro lado aparece el modelo period stico norteamericano que hace de la informaci n el objetivo de un peri dico como espacio en donde se debat an las concepciones de los social y en el que no hab a partido pol tico por peque o que fuera que no tuviera el suyo hemos pasado a un tipo de periodismo basado en la informaci n

1532974 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1532975 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1532976 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something

1532993 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way

1532995 in 2006 we reclaimed the term mcjob with our not bad for a mcjob campaign and over the past two years we have received considerable support from our employees our customers and business leaders

1532997 well god surely doesnt expect me to be like that
1532998 because of gods grace whatever has happened to me at this moment i can reach out my hand of faith and take hold of gods hand of grace and i can exchange my life of failure to his life of love and holiness and i can know myself to be fully accepted

1533004 but he has at least shown a competency and understanding of the game at maybe a higher level than some of the other freshmen back there
1533005 the key to our program is consistency but most freshmen go up and down and up and down
1533006 expectations are made very clear and hes responded to those expectations which means hes the right guy and we say that about any of our recruits
1533007 the more that i have been a head coach and i dont know what you would call it maturity maybe but i hate seeing these kids get hurt and i understand the importance of 13 games and it being a long season to be injured before you get to those games doesnt make a lot of sense

1533040 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1533041 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december

1533052 boots on the ground in this war long range efforts will not suffice
1533053 a spiritual cell group is very similar to a biological cell followers of jesus christ edify one another and increase the kingdom by sharing their lives with unbelievers new leaders are raised up from within the group with the support and training by their pastoral staff to grow and expand the ministry to a hurting world when the group multiplies the process repeats itself
1533054 cell groups arent simply another name for a bible study fellowship group or sunday school class they are a group of believers who have banded together for a season in life to reach the lost minister to the hurting and each other and discover their leadership potential sure cell groups study the word but they do so in order to live out what they read and use it effectively to penetrate a dark world with the light of jesus christ which is quite different from studying a passage each week for general knowledge cell groups also have lots of fun together but this fellowship is specialized in that it usually exposes unbelievers to a group of fun jesus loving people in other words cell groups even use fellowship as an evangelistic tool and last it wouldnt be right to call a sunday morning classroom experience a cell group a cell group should meet in a place and time that is comfortable for both the believers and unbelievers visiting and provide enough time to share deep concerns and pray for one another rarely can either of these things be done within one hour at a church building early on a sunday morning
1533055 just 18 percent think the country is moving in the right direction and only 31 percent approve of the job president bush is doing both readings are a bit better than the record lows in the ap ipsos poll that both measures scored in mid july

1533059 in the near term we can use compressed natural gas in internal combustion engines
1533060 in the long term natural gas could be an excellent source for making hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles either at the filling station or in peoples homes
1533061 the dominance of the out of town shopping centres with free car parking makes it so much more difficult for local businesss to survive
1533062 the average person travels 893 miles a year to shop for food and this years big hike in car parking charges locally only makes matters worse it encourages people to drive away from local shops for the convenience of the out of town store
1533063 over 50 of the turnover of independent retailers goes back into the local community compared to just 5 from supermarkets furthermore the carbon footprint per square metre of a small shop is a fraction of that of a supermarket
1533064 2000 local shops are closing each year and the trend is accelerating
1533065 this is great news for upton without solid community support throughout the consultation stages this bid would have been dead in the water
1533066 we talked about the problems faced by the pub industry such as the supermarket pricing of alcohol which is making it very difficult to compete and also the affects of the smoking ban which in my opinion has caused a lot of loss of trade
1533067 i think he was interested really in the grass roots opinions and he seemed very receptive
1533068 in an age when most people get their politics from the television it was heartening to see around 300 people engaged in a lively debate on a wide range of topics important to local people
1533069 this was a genuinely open event with no hand picked audience no planted questions and no spin
1533070 yes mama and he likes to bowl thats why the sky rumbles and he gets lots of scores
1533071 so in the last month i had been on and off researching the 70s of course my main intention was more about finding out how the family should be dressed for this special occasion rather than making historical inquiries

1533076 but if you were given a free pizza at brunos roccos barnabys dominics would you go there have you even heard of those places
1533077 you see restaurants in south bend and mishawaka face a dilemma they want student business but dont know how to get it
1533078 ndtogo brings cheap starving students to restaurants hungry for their business we do so through coupons giveaways and an unmatched in depth directory
1533079 which cafes have free wifi what beers do they have on tap at parisis which joint stutter 1 serves fried frog legs joes tavern does by the way
1533080 you will be able to search by event is your family in town
1533081 we just started 3 weeks ago and weve collected 3500 in free food from 16 local restaurants that were giving away in the next two weeks

1533085 these are exciting policies for worcestershire and for britain local people tell me they are fed up with rising prices unfair taxes the waste of money on the id card scheme and a labour government that just doesnt seem to care
1533086 west worcestershire is one of the more marginal seats in the country with just over a thousand switch votes for the liberal democrats to win every vote for the lib dems here is a vote for these fairer policies set out by nick clegg
1533087 no one in worcestershire has escaped the rising cost of food and fuel
1533088 who in the hell is that what is his problem
1533089 estamos certos de que isso nada mais do que impor o projeto de reforma rejeitado em dezembro
1533090 h coisas que podem ser feitas sem necessidade de reformular a constitui o
1533091 restringir ou proibir a importa o exporta o distribui o troca ou venda
1533092 assumir o controle da distribui o quando julgar necess rio
1533093 o governo acredita que pode avan ar na dire o de um sistema econ mico estatal e centralizado mas isso vai provocar mais conflito com a comunidade empresarial
1533094 i hope the fact that such a small action can have an impact will inspire people to take part in this campaign and knit a hat for save the children
1533095 i have forgotten how to knit but would be very happy to join in a knitting circle and learn again with a group of volunteer knitters
1533096 this is a completely inadequate deterrent to unscrupulous shop keepers who flout the law to sell these weapons to children and young people
1533097 these tiny fines and a lack of custodial punishment is the wrong signal to those who profit from the illegal sale of knives
1533098 these figures are particularly worrying as they came to light only days after the release of other figures showing 144 serious crimes in the west mercia police authority area involved a knife in 2007 8 knife crime is 15 of all serious crimes taking place here
1533099 these figures do not record children and young people separately but they do show that knife crime is a serious problem it is too easy for children and young people to get hold of knives too many are being drawn into a culture of carrying and using knives
1533100 liberal democrats believe that the courts must take a much stronger stand against those who are fuelling knife crime by illegally selling knives to children and young people
1533101 cutting the supply of knives will be one of the most effective ways to reducing knife crime in the first place
1533102 i have spoken to the agencys area flood risk manager anthony perry who has assured me that a new flood risk assessment will be published within a matter of days
1533103 a great deal of good work has been done locally to bring this about and everyone concerned should be congratulated
1533104 i know that members of the new street flood forum the town council and others have worked incredibly hard with environment agency officials to develop the flood defence scheme
1533105 with the money secured they fully expected that construction of the new street bund would start in conjunction with the marina development this summer and that work on the riverside defences would commence soon afterwards
1533106 despite a clear expectation that works would commence around this time no planning application was forthcoming and by last month it became clear that expectations within the environment agency had changed
1533107 this is a real concern for many who worked so hard to win the case for funding and for building these defences
1533108 homes and businesses have suffered from huge insurance excess increases and will now be exposed to prolonged flood risk as a result of these delays
1533109 the opportunity to move excavated earth directly from the marina development to build the new street bund will be lost too unless work on the marina is also delayed
1533110 if you want to rock you know where to find us

1533207 it seems to me that sony has made a corporate decision to double down on recorded music
1533208 since its already in game platforms and electronics it seems theyre going back to the content is king strategy and taking the recorded music forward into these other platforms
1533209 sony will be attempting more aggressively with playstation network to create an internet distribution platform for content
1533210 music is a very popular form of content and they want to be well positioned as they roll that out i think this acquisition would be related to that

1533228 social networking sites grew very quickly and without some examination about their use and the amount of information that is available on them the consequences could be drastic
1533229 that new stage is powerful because now facebook users can not only share information about web sites and businesses with their friends but invite friends to weigh in on shopping and other activities on the web yes facebook has become a sort of online mall where users can shop with the input of their friends

1533232 we have to keep in mind that the it sector targets its products to the young and affluent having in mind a trickle down model from early adopters to the broad public product developers do not care very much about the fact that the elderly cannot use tiny mobile telephones very well or that they are unable to decipher icons
1533233 we remain provocatively paranoid about the internet you have to be thinking of ways in which you can deal with it when i first came on i thought of the internet as this sort of hurricane coming right towards us that had already hit newspapers and now would come to magazines which were further ashore
1533234 but now it seems to be sort of glancing magazines rather than hitting directly its not true for all magazines there are some that have been hit quite badly but the sort of thing that were doing at the moment seems to be helping us rather than hurting us because its putting so much more information out there

1533241 this is the first attempt to gun down a journalist under my time and i want to see these suspects behind bars
1533242 this could be work related considering cuesta was a hard hitting radio commentator and also a witness to an illegal detention case still we cannot use these circumstances as evidence we need to gather hard evidences and witnesses that will lead to the arrest of the suspects

1533253 the principle that data packets on the internet should be moved impartially without regard to content destination or source
1533254 to ensure fundamental protections for the internet as a non discriminatory platform
1533255 there is a notion out there that all bits are created equal
1533256 but no bits are created equal some bits carry porn while others carry critical information like interactive video for heart surgery treating all bits the same is a costly and inefficient use of bandwidth
1533257 and why would we want to do that selling service to customers is our business the more traffic we have on our networks the more money we make we just need to manage it carefully
1533258 verizon may have reversed its initial decision in this case and im glad they did but the fact that they were willing and able to take their initial action is very troublesome

1533264 were moving ahead to make sure our waste is in a safe configuration so that it can be disposed of properly
1533265 it will be one of a few projects in the country with a designated person at the top level of the federal government to coordinate and make sure things are moving forward at pace and that saves time it saves wasted dollars
1533266 by thinking critically researching alternatives and possibilities and continually questioning we may at least feel more confident that our truth is true

1533275 to morrow and to morrow and to morrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
1533276 credit and debit card information is just not incredibly secure
1533277 but it is counterbalanced by the amount of fraud losses due to cheque fraud and direct debit fraud which is much greater than credit card fraud
1533278 regardless of how strong the security measures and how vigilant the weak part of the chain is there is always a human who is responsible and who has overall control over the information
1533279 assume that there will be some sort of fraud on your account sooner or later
1533280 our information is a lot more secure after all the publicity we have had about attacks
1533281 but yes there are still problems that still exist though it is getting safer
1533282 if the proper encryption is configured on the wireless access point then an attacker will not be able to get any information i would have to bet in this case that didnt happen
1533283 if you are a victim of credit card fraud you might get your identity stolen and then you lose more than just money you lose time you lose trust and it could take years to fix your credit
1533284 if a cardholder is concerned at all about the security of their account they should immediately contact their issuing financial institution
1533285 it is not our job to go around checking who is compliant with this that is lead by the credit card brands
1533286 we have no choice but to trust the retailers are doing their bit but we can do more
1533287 we had our home in the village more than an acre of land two cows and a plough
1533288 fifteen years ago the meghna devoured everything in a matter of six months rendering us homeless and poverty stricken there was no job no food and no security of life

1533293 ultrasound is very good at showing up internal bleeding gall stones vascular or soft tissue problems
1533294 after the examination is completed the pictures are sent over the internet to a radiologist in melbourne or sydney and the report is faxed back the following day
1533295 i live in jindabyne and i wanted to work locally so i went and bought my own machine to become an owner operator
1533296 ive spoken to the doctors both in delegate and bombala and they are now aware im available locally for all ultrasound procedures
1533297 i had a very productive day in bombala meeting with constituents and the council
1533298 i was delighted to be able to pass on the information that the bombala council will be receiving 1 45 million in federal assistance grant money which is a 6 5 increase this is the highest increase of any council in nsw
1533299 i asked the council to also advise me of the projects they would like to advance and get assistance with over the next few years to enable me to engage with them on forward planning
1533300 the council did a great job on outlining these projects and this will certainly help us all to work together for the benefit of the people of bombala
1533301 you can only vote in the council area you live in on election day as there will be no absentee voting so if voters will be absent from their council on the day they should consider pre polling or postal voting
1533302 many people i meet at trade shows around the country dont realise there is a national state and territory government and industry inspired plantation strategy
1533303 it was straight into the lions den i came across farmers concerned about plantations encroaching on agricultural land and rural communities
1533304 theres nothing random about forestry plantations in australia its built on years of solid research and takes on board landholders and community views to ensure policies are equitable
1533305 forestry is one of the most sustainable forms of productive land use available trees are just another crop they just take longer to grow and harvest
1533306 when i started this job there was a swag of great research and facts out there but it was tied up in chunky reports that i suspect very few people had read
1533307 ive crystallised the key points about the plantation industry into fact sheets and websites so it makes sense to the specialist and to the lay person
1533308 i grew up in bombala and delegate surrounded by pine plantations and native forests many of my fellow students found work in the forestry industry there
1533309 growing up in a plantation area allowed me to see its impact on my region from up close and personal over the years as i maintain family ties with the district
1533310 drought and a noticeable shift of resources from sheep to cropping is likely to have seen the national sheep flock fall a further 6 5 percent in the year to june 2008 to around 80 million head making it the lowest australian sheep flock since 1920 smaller declines in the flock are now anticipated resulting in a base of around 76 million head by 2011
1533311 with another poor breeding season and high lamb turnoff at the end of 2007 lamb slaughter in 2008 is forecast to decline nine percent from the 2007 record to 19 2 million head and production by eight percent to 404 000 tonnes still the second highest production on record
1533312 after suffering a sharp fall in real farm cash incomes in 2006 07 with rising costs and debts many lamb producers were simply not in a position to meet the very high cost of fodder and grain required to carry lambs over into 2008
1533313 however the local and global demand supply balance for lamb continues to tighten providing the prospect of higher lamb prices and attractive returns to lamb producers once seasons improve
1533314 perhaps the most significant change in this mid year update to the projections released in february is on the sheep side with the ongoing drought and sudden lift in the lure of cropping causing a shift in resources out of sheep particularly in wa and to a lesser degree south australia and victoria
1533315 buoyant middle east economies driven by oil revenues construction and tourism are expected to keep australias live sheep exports from falling precipitously with only a five percent decline in 2008 to 3 6 million head reaching a base of around 3 million by 2010

1533320 the engineer decided not to get out of his car anymore hoping that the police would somehow disperse the bottleneck the heat of august combined with a passage of time marked by tires so that the immobility was ever more exasperating everything was the smell of gasoline rowdy yells from the youths in the simca the glare of the sun reflecting off glass and chrome and to top it off the contradictory sensation of being trapped in the heart of a jungle of machines designed for speed
1533321 that means the traffic jams start at 3 a m and keep going
1533322 its no longer a question of more cars but rather increased use of the car for longer commutes and for leisure
1533323 many of the difficult stretches correspond to places where there are great wines

1533333 when i had the initial conversation with him i explained we were not asking you to be our everyday center fielder were only asking you to go out there when you feel great
1533334 i dont think id rather do something else at this point in my life
1533335 we put him in the game with green bay on the cover and in the green bay uniform if he does become a free agent i dont know what well do
1533336 if i say the guy makes a long run and i say watch the left guard and i circle this guy and say hes going to pull here now everyone is on the same page
1533337 we put him in the game with green bay on the cover and in the green bay uniform if he does become a free agent i dont know what well do
1533338 will be a keepsake thats just an example of natural things that change the game
1533339 we dont so much as launch madden any more we celebrate its arrival
1533340 its easy to say aw yeah hell i saw it coming
1533341 i thought maybe i could use this tool and high schools could use it
1533342 in those days any kind of game was always three on three or four on four
1533343 i said if its not 11 on 11 its not a real game it had to look like nfl football
1533344 that whole idea of having madden help design the game that whole point of authenticity gave birth to the brand identity for ea sports
1533345 the property has been among the top 10 franchises each and every year and most of those it was among the top five
1533346 there are only a handful of elite properties that can claim that sort of success
1533347 in the company of brett favre and joe montana and not that far behind tiger woods
1533348 the unusual thing is how pervasive he has become in and out of the sport hes transcending his profession
1533349 arguably john is known among certain circles more for his video game today than he is for anything else
1533350 hes almost had three separate lifes a coach a commentator and video game guy
1533351 i go to practices and some guy you dont even know where it came from
1533352 hey madden i need more juice they all need more juice
1533353 i was at a cowboys facility they had been playing
1533354 you want to see how the guys who make the game view you
1533355 one of the goals fox has is to make their game on television look like a video game
1533356 i thought weve gone the whole circle we wanted to look like them and then they wanted to look like us im proud of that
1533357 at one time it was just playing the game then there was ways you can change your roster and then you can be the general manager and then owner and coach and player
1533358 now they get a grade so they can see they have a number
1533359 it makes me feel the game has been accepted as a historical part of the history of pro football

1533419 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
1533420 we need perspective on this i was there during the cultural revolution and i watched people being carted away in the streets to be shot in the back of the neck about 3 million people died ive been back often since and each time there is a sort of incremental freedom though sometimes it moves backward

1533464 this is our my predicament over and over again we lose sight of what is important and what isnt we crave things over which we have no control and are not satisfied by the things within our control we need to regularly stop and take stock to sit down and determine within ourselves which things are worth valuing and which things are not which risks are worth the cost and which are not even the most confusing or hurtful aspects of life can be made more tolerable by clear seeing and by choice
1533465 what will you do with the rest of your one wild and crazy life
1533466 the timeframe of 37 days made an impression on me we act as if we have all the time in the world thats not a new understanding but the definite ness of 37 days struck me so short a time as if all the regrets of a life would barely have time to register before time was up
1533467 i am proud of the fact that our principals work diligently to find the very best teachers possible our students deserve no less than the best
1533468 a year ago we were recruiting because of a statewide teacher shortage this year mainly because of the state level budget cuts and positive reputation of our school district we have had a surplus of teachers with up to 70 qualified applicants for many of the positions

1533498 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1533499 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb

1533508 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1533509 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1533510 reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1533511 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1533512 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1533513 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1533514 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1533515 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1533516 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1533517 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1533518 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk

1533525 me dijeron que ser a por solo cuatro meses mientras encontraban un espacio para ubicarlo en el hospital y mire por donde va eso ese horno me est perjudicando y lo peor es que nadie se ha querido hacer responsable de l

1533527 its pretty complex as far as the way he feels the chain of events the path that we have taken to get here
1533528 its not as simple as no 4 running out there playing football
1533529 this is something that has been very stressful for him
1533530 its been very stressful for his family he feels the same way the green bay packers do he would like to resolve this as soon as possible
1533531 its just to the point now where were tired of it here in the locker room
1533532 the locker room isnt divided at all no one is picking sides everybody just really wants to concentrate on football
1533533 it needs to end it needs to end as soon as possible so we can get back to just talking about the green bay packers as a whole and not just one player
1533534 theres a lot of pressure just being a quarterback but when youre in a situation where youre following a guy whos played for 16 years here and amassed the kind of numbers the records mvps he has obviously the standards are high
1533535 i have high expectations for myself i know my teammates have high expectations for my play and so does the coaching staff and the personnel department so i know im expected to play at a high level and i expect to as well
1533536 we have great fans i hope i can win them over
1533537 we could never get back to that point where he was comfortable
1533538 its very personal for him and understandably so i have had a very up front seat throughout this whole process he has been right in the middle of it its emotional for him very personal i dont want to be redundant i dont want to speak for brett i respect the way he feels but he is in a tough spot
1533539 he had no problem with any of that he would have come in and competed for his job and im sure it would have been a hell of a fight
1533540 i didnt get the answers to the questions that i was looking for to open that competition up so why would i do that to my football team
1533541 they dont have any interest whatsoever in drilling down to clearly analyse the problems confronting producers in relation to what consumers are paying and they seem to be very happy with where the two majors sit coles and woolworths
1533542 we thought that with mirani paying basically double what the mackay rates were we should be sympathetic to try and make sure that mirani growers continued to be viable
1533543 obviously it is a fair burden on them over time so weve actually decided to decrease their rates by 0 55 cents
1533544 theyve been whacked between the eyes with increases in fuel whacked with the increases in fertiliser

1533547 my wind felt good and im just trying to focus on the little things like pad level i dont have to really learn the offense this year so that is a little easier just knowing the plays so i can focus on my part
1533548 you have personal goals and ive always kept those to myself
1533549 we know what our ultimate goal is as a team and thats a championship the personal goals are nice but it doesnt mean much if you dont win
1533550 we didnt end the way we wanted to last year so im still hungry even more hungry than i was last year i think guys on this team want it weve got a young team were unselfish and guys want to win
1533551 i needed to be here with the team and i needed to be with the guys i wanted guys to see me and know what type of person i am and what this team means to me
1533552 i do plan on being more involved in the offense just because i am more comfortable
1533553 i know what they are looking for and i know what is going on from the different sets so i think it is something we can be a little more versatile in

1533571 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1533572 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination

1533610 it really celebrates the neighborhood crime patrolling efforts and the neighborhood watch programs we have about 850 neighborhood watches in jacksonville this celebrates the ones that are in existence and hopefully recruits new ones recognizing their partnership with law enforcement really makes jacksonville safer and gives us a better chance of winning the war on crime
1533611 one of things ive always said is that not only do we need more officers on the street but we need massive community support and national night out helps build that community support for fighting crime in their neighborhood
1533612 for one they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy but the robustness of our religious practice folks tend to forget that during our founding it wasnt the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the first amendment it was the persecuted minorities it was baptists like john leland who didnt want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves it was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious because they did not want state sponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it moreover given the increasing diversity of americas population the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater whatever we once were we are no longer just a christian nation we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation a buddhist nation a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers and even if we did have only christians in our midst if we expelled every non christian from the united states of america whose christianity would we teach in the schools would we go with james dobsons or al sharptons which passages of scripture should guide our public policy should we go with leviticus which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination how about deuteronomy which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith or should we just stick to the sermon on the mount a passage that is so radical that its doubtful that our own defense department would survive its application so before we get carried away lets read our bibles folks havent been reading their bibles this brings me to my second point democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion specific values it requires that their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason i may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons but if i seek to pass a law banning the practice i cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke gods will i have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths including those with no faith at all

1533614 apart from those psychological profiles of senator obama appearing in the mass media nothing has appeared in print from the obama campaign which proffers any response to the reality of the presently onrushing global financial breakdown crisis currently hurtling through the international system toward a presently threatened early general breakdown of the world economy as a whole

1533662 the vast majority of farmers have never had it so good
1533663 ethiopians are not hapless they are not helpless we are making a real dent in poverty

1533665 one unexpected weather event can push us over the precipice

1533674 the current shape of football in bulgaria is a reflection of the current state of the country so unfortunately such things the cska case are happening
1533675 we have to accept that we cant be a soccer powerhouse when we are still a way behind the leading european countries in political and economic terms
1533676 our clubs cant compare at the moment to the ones that play in the biggest leagues in europe so its not a surprise that they are fulfilling the requests more slowly they just cant afford to do it quickly they dont have the financial power
1533677 but the most important thing is that were going in the right direction we reacted by taking all the necessary steps and were trying to help clubs to implement conditions set by uefa
1533678 yes we handed out a stadium ban but we see that the clubs realise their mistakes and have the will to make amends
1533679 well fans want to go to a modern stadium and watch players like ronaldinho and so do i but it just cant happen with a magic wand we have to be patient and go step by step
1533680 all stadiums have passed stringent safety tests and we handed ban to those places presenting risk to the crowd we didnt make any compromise but we assured clubs that we can be partners and we would be always happy to help
1533681 im pleased to say that finally clubs sports bodies and institutions agreed to join forces and condemn the fan violence and to distance ourselves from racism
1533682 the bfu turned to the government and to the police for help to eradicate the problem but i know it will take time in fact the hardest thing was to convince the institutions that this is an extremely serious problem
1533683 we now have a very strict law on violence at sports events and all we need is a will to implement it and punish the perpetrators
1533684 if you look at quite a few other clubs theyve not been able to bring in as many players as we have at this point
1533685 at this time of year everyone has expectations and people will look at the situation and make their own minds up
1533686 our job is to try and fulfil all the promise weve got in the squad because with everyone fit weve got a strong group of players
1533687 theres still some work to do but im really looking forward to the start of the season we might not do as well as we think we can but thats the fascination of a season

1533760 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1533761 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1533762 the majority of the have been eagerly waiting for your visit
1533763 and of course behind these people there were those who were sort of opposed
1533764 i admire your forthrightness your integrity and your deep love for the people of korea
1533765 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti
1533766 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1533767 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1533768 while there may be some who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the supermarket shelves
1533769 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1533770 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1533771 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1533772 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1533773 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1533774 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1533775 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1533776 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1533777 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a
1533778 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season
1533779 i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1533780 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one
1533781 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1533782 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected
1533783 but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well

1533807 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1533808 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1533809 as you heard i will be pleading not guilty and in due course the courts will make their decision

1533867 hiv and aids remains a critical issue for glbt people as the epidemic continues to affect our community disproportionately particularly young people and gay and bisexual men of color we ask that the platform continue to call for robust funding of prevention care and research efforts prevention programs must be comprehensive science based and focused on the communities they are meant to serve we ask that the platform include a call for the development and implementation of a comprehensive national strategy on hiv aids
1533868 i came out as hiv positive in april as part of national day of silence i have known for just over a year now and i am a well known figure in my state and particularly in the capitol but when i approached the aso here to start connecting with them to do speaking engagements they had no funds for prevention to reach into schools it had been cut early on in the bush administration
1533869 these statements again make clear that sen mccain has a long way to go to earn the votes of those who care about hiv aids in america sadly this seeming disinterest in the epidemic is not new for sen mccain his record on aids vacillates between total disengagement and reactionary cant voters considering supporting sen mccain must demand that he take this epidemic more seriously and articulate meaningful proposals and specific commitments for dealing with it

1533875 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1533876 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook

1533882 the change in the economy has been abrupt serious and its a created a different kind of recession
1533883 this is an issue that is obviously on the mind of voters and its important for candidates and activists to understand what is happening and to have messages that can work with voters
1533884 we are trying to provide real policy alternatives to the political messaging
1533885 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1533886 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1533887 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1533888 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1533889 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1533890 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1533891 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1533892 i definitely wish i was never singled out i came up there to do a story thats all i wanted to do is write a story
1533893 its the right thing for the mccain campaign to do
1533894 our issue remains with the his actions are still a problem the senators campaign has done the right thing and we appreciate that
1533895 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1533896 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1533897 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead

1533901 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1533902 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1533903 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1533904 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important in years
1533905 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1533906 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1533907 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created

1533916 doua meciuri pe etapa vor ramane netelevizate iar cluburile trebuiau sa se ridice si sa sesizeze aceasta problema la adunarile generale dinaintea licitatiei pentru drepturile de televizare
1533917 oricum cluburile nu pierd pentru ca audientele inregistrate sunt mici ele oricum si au luat banii iar asa vine mai multa lume pe stadion

1533919 this year more than ever these debates are going to be important
1533920 this campaign started on such a high plane and now were down to the britney spears ads and stuff like that i think it will be a good thing for the country to see these two men at the debates
1533921 it is a very important event a major event for our country im always aware of that its scorching im trying to make sure that things are fair but thats only part of it its also got to be perceived as fair its tough work but its exhilarating as well
1533922 before there was no way for the moderators to go in there with a follow up question
1533923 itll be my job to get them to ask the follow up question themselves and when they dont ill be able to

1533926 aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
1533927 american businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy these considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect

1533937 there is another way to open the vault but it involves tactics that are not part of my repertoire
1533938 there isnt a safe or vault built that the shadow cant enter
1533939 the vault was designed with and emergency release if the owner is mortally wounded then the vault will open one last time goemon will have to smear his blood on the door after that not even the medallion can open it again
1533940 i never really took the time to search it thoroughly
1533941 as far as i could tell just mountains of jewels and gold and some antique furniture its probably just old family heirlooms you know how elves get attached to that kind of stuff
1533942 didnt the golden elves seize everything of value after the dark elf kingdom collapse
1533943 since they never discovered the vault we might be able to make a handsome ransom for some of the things in there
1533944 hes probably just trying to make it to the docks before the next ship sails
1533945 you search this end and ill look down there if you find him do whatever it takes to stall him if you arent back in this spot in twenty minutes ill come find you

1533950 the days of sexual jealousy as a defence are over
1533951 one not easily jealous but being wrought perplexd in the extreme
1533952 the reality is that although it is not a gendered defence 86 per cent of domestic homicides are committed by men and the victims are their female partners
1533953 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
1533954 tough on the victim how do we forgive the perpetrator
1533955 i thought you said ed that you knew how to fly that thing
1533956 i believe her exact words were move over you useless meat puppet its my ship
1533957 youre the one who said you could fix the shlouby geut thing its been over three hours already some healer you are
1533958 i aint never heard of no bird that could meow that just aint natural and its creepy too
1533959 ill just walk back to that gq station we flew over and order for repairs
1533960 ooh sometimes its cheaper to just get a new one
1533961 see if you can get the green one this time
1533962 why on elitavia did i trust such a simple task to a convoy of clumsy carnivorous cretins
1533963 you told us to keep the dark elf busy and out of your hair you never made any mention of a mage that could summon ghouls to his aid
1533964 that mage had no business in circle root and besides youre already dead you couldve put up a better fight
1533965 it took us a whole week to piece ourselves back together
1533966 no thanks to you and just because were decaying at a more alarming rate than the rest of this shlouby planet doesnt mean we cant feel pain
1533967 why dont you just turn us back into regular healthy humans well still help you take over the world or whatever it is you want just please for the love of the gods make the pain stop
1533968 i thought i told you not to call me by that name anymore
1533969 maureen is dead whatever relationships or plans you deviants had with that little strumpet died with her i keep her body simply as a means to an end
1533970 several months ago when i accidentally happened upon you low life leeches i decided i would need a suitable guise and humans with such low ambitions like the ones you cling to were perfect for generating that first wave of terror throughout maccabe
1533971 this is precisely why ive kept you here on majourne
1533972 but as my campaign for world domination is thus far running as planned with only a few minor kinks i suppose i did rather good considering
1533973 well seeing as it youre in such a good mood and everything
1533974 the boys and i were hoping that we could maybe have our manhood back
1533975 we are the zombies you see and were like you know the tough bad boys who are rebels always on the lam savvy and we go where we want when we want
1533976 i we all ave this dream you see and me an the boys we always liked the idea you see all the perks that come with being feared and adored at the same time its like insanely ingenious
1533977 but its slightly difficult to spread fear chaos and still have fun without feeling less than a man
1533978 but at least we could still feel like regular men
1533979 you pathetic lazy witless sloth were just wasting away you spent most of your miserable lives terrorizing vandalizing peaceful little communities spreading your foul retarded demon seed amongst the fruitful i did you a favour
1533980 its not like the old geezer was being all gentle like with the nag neither
1533981 i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about is all
1533982 is it because we made that old man sit there and watch us eat it afterwards
1533983 why werent you able to dispose of that goemon fellow
1533984 the fool mage returned and reactivated that infuriating guildquest station
1533985 oh cozmo darling if you truly wish to redeem yourself and risk no further punishment to you or your equally detestable

1534013 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1534014 the majority of the have been eagerly waiting for your visit
1534015 and of course behind these people there were those who were sort of opposed
1534016 i admire your forthrightness your integrity and your deep love for the people of korea
1534017 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti
1534018 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1534019 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1534020 while there may be some who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the supermarket shelves

1534022 besides accidents shipbreaking workers are prone to many diseases including cancer ulceration sterility and deafness
1534023 we risk our lives here only to support our families because hazard free regular employment is not easily available
1534024 for every 12 hours of work contractors pay each of us 300 taka 2 24 pounds
1534025 as the industry is vital for us we have taken steps to reduce mishaps by imparting training and creating awareness among employers and workers
1534026 for example engines of scrapped ships are reimported by some western countries for re use
1534027 they bangladeshis take up the risky job often knowing the deadly consequences because they have no other way to beat abject poverty
1534028 for ensuring sustainability of this vital industry the government employers and workers need to work together toward a decent work environment around human rights principles
1534029 the huge task of dismantling ships is done manually in bangladesh with basic protection like helmets gloves or goggles not provided to the workers
1534030 however it is an industry that bangladesh can ill afford to lose the nation has no domestic sources of iron ore and is faced with high prices for new steel in the international markets
1534031 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1534032 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1534033 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1534034 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1534035 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1534036 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are
1534037 i do believe that the most important action that could be taken to improve customer satisfaction is to truly engage customers by establishing a significant relationship with them through extended attention to what motivates them to take a particular stance in correlation to the company
1534038 lets really pay attention to what our customers say they want from us
1534039 never use a long word where a short one will do
1534040 always prefer the clean direct word to the long vague one dont implement promises but keep them
1534041 poor faulkner does he really think big emotions come from big words he thinks i dont know the ten dollar words i know them all right but there are older and simpler and better words and those are the ones i use
1534042 a scrupulous writer in every sentence that he writes will ask himself at least four questions thus what am i trying to say what words will express it what image or idiom will make it clearer is this image fresh enough to have an effect and he will probably ask himself two more could i put it more shortly have i said anything that is avoidably ugly but you are not obliged to go to all this trouble you can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready made phrases come crowding in they will construct your sentences for you even think your thoughts for you to a certain extent and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself
1534043 i would like to take this opportunity to offer a hearty congratulations to you
1534044 if you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough if you cant explain it to a six year old you dont understand it yourself
1534045 yeah but im pretty sure lightening travels faster than you or i can swim
1534046 she wrote the way she lived on the fly without retrospect always on the way climbing higher
1534047 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1534049 we need warmer weather in august to ensure crops can mature before the first fall frost
1534050 the apartment was fantastic and the envy of all my colleagues who took the time to drop in whilst we were there
1534051 then there is no way apple can get over its current spate of problems
1534052 profiled a service from feedblitz today and it may be many things he says but one thing you cant say is that it doesnt rest inside an innovative business model
1534053 excuse me i need another one of those swedish meatballs
1534054 excuse me while i let you two get to know each other
1534055 this financial thing is a challenge but im going to learn it and make it work for me

1534059 both the jury and judge sleet have recognised and upheld our fundamental right to set and make changes to the atp tour calendar changes that are necessary if we are to unlock the full potential of our sport
1534060 their decision also supports atps position that this process of change was undertaken in a transparent vigorous and good faith manner
1534061 for the sins of your life you have received this mark of shame you are drevn
1534062 we beg forgiveness exalted one of being so unworthy of your presence
1534063 broken and bound he will never trespass into the sacred sky
1534064 anyone who saw him are to die regardless of rank
1534065 this secret dies with you when it is time for you to die
1534066 you are damned creature in another life perhaps you could earn redemption but not this one
1534067 exalted one would it not be better to kill him
1534068 yes but such was the deal struck to find him
1534069 keep him in darkness and pain but he will not be killed
1534070 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues

1534108 this protest is to show the faroese government and parliament that whether or not it is in the name of christianity the surrounding world does not find discriminating acts against homosexual people acceptable
1534109 unfortunately right now violence and discrimination against people who have spoken up about their homosexuality in public is not uncommon in the faeroe islands and because there is no law to protect the homosexual minority against such discrimination it is often considered legal and acceptable to commit these actions against homosexuals

1534158 how could we say that revelation was closed at the death of the last of the apostles if a subsequent belief were not connected to it by a truly rational and logical bond
1534159 for the holy spirit was not promised to the successors of peter that by his revelation they might disclose new doctrine but that by his help they might guard sacredly the revelation transmitted through the apostles and the deposit of faith and might faithfully set it forth
1534160 revelation constituting the object of the catholic faith was not completed with the apostles
1534161 fr bachofen was for nine years professor of canon law at the benedictine college of st anselm in rome and had therefore an intimate knowledge of the methods and traditions of the roman curia
1534162 christ our lord has entrusted to the church the deposit of faith in order that by the continual assistance of the holy ghost she might preserve the revealed doctrine and expound it faithfully
1534163 all those truths which are contained in the written word of god or in tradition and proposed to our belief as divinely revealed either by a solemn proclamation or by the ordinary and universal magisterium of the church must be believed by divine and catholic faith
1534164 and grampa never played his mouth organ again after that day
1534165 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1534166 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1534206 ok timmy if it will shut you up then you can have it
1534207 i had dinner once with richard clark at the table and i said is there an equivalent to the patriot act an ipatriot act just sitting waiting for some substantial event just waiting for them to come have the excuse for radically changing the way the internet works
1534208 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1534209 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1534210 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1534211 im sorry i havent said anything before but i didnt want to worry you it looks like i might be arrested at climate camp it is my choice and its something i feel strongly about please dont be angry
1534212 we are also doing this because we feel our bail conditions are disproportionate to our supposed offences i can see the logic in keeping us away from power stations but to keep us away from this event where people are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change is wrong
1534213 you can increase precipitation from one individual storm by as much as 50 percent
1534214 you cant just go out and seed clear skies and make it rain you have to seed specific clouds at a specific time in their life
1534215 most of the places where this works theres a lack of condensation nuclei here i would think theres no shortage of aerosols just from the salt spray and dust from africa and pollution
1534216 clouds pesky critters that they are you just cant steer them where you want
1534217 they are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place
1534218 their scientists privately acknowledge that there really isnt any proof that they can do this kind of stuff
1534219 i dont think id want to run their weather modification program
1534220 i hope they have clear weather just so they dont have to try anything
1534221 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1534222 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1534223 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1534224 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1534225 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1534226 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1534227 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1534228 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1534229 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1534230 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1534231 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1534232 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1534233 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1534234 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1534235 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1534236 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1534237 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked
1534238 a hope in the unseen an american odyssey from the inner city to the ivy league
1534239 wrote it as fast as possible and were publishing it as fast as possible because there is news in the book and we dont want to sit on it

1534241 this is my favourite layout so far i enjoyed doodling with my white gel pen so much it was like being a kid again
1534242 greenpeace offshore drilling its not the answer to high gas prices at the pump
1534243 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1534244 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and took her
1534245 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of
1534246 these concoctions just show how the americans will stop at nothing to subvert justice
1534247 they say that she is an al qaeda supporter and that shes very dangerous yet shes left alone in a room with a weapon this is pure fantasy
1534248 this woman stayed there until she lost her mind until she became insane hitting the door and screaming day and night

1534252 people are still dying mysteriously and horribly people who were uninjured in the cataclysm from an unknown something which i can describe as the atomic plague
1534253 planted in the house of the lord they will flourish in the courts of our god
1534254 you have to have someone who knows his signs and symptoms like for colin his lips get pale or he gets quiet or weepy and he may not want to deal with it at that moment and want to ignore it
1534255 the crime wave unpardonably advances because of corruption the fragility of what we call the rule of law the inefficiency of police
1534256 surely by now we would have advanced much more along the road to improving the police
1534257 they operate with checkpoints capturing the victims in all the other cases the victims have been returned
1534258 we have heard so many times that they are going to straighten out and clean up the police its never happened
1534259 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1534260 we are seeing real strength in national and particularly in some of the cable up fronts but also on our broadcast network business
1534261 the vast majority of consumers in the u s as well as in europe
1534262 the growth there is really extraordinary and we will be doing more and more there
1534263 we dont quite know if we scale back a bit in poland which is proving more difficult than we expected or a diversion of those resources elsewhere
1534264 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1534265 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1534266 i think its a great day in the state of mississippi for justice
1534267 obviously everybody wants to have credible competent witnesses particularly when theyre expert witnesses
1534268 i ve been in the development of this game since day one
1534269 one of my goals was to make the videogame look like television
1534270 definitely for those adults who arent afraid to laugh out loud
1534271 the idea is not to have it be one of these year long projects but to be more strategic and timely
1534272 we are asking our social workers to do a huge and critical job
1534273 in my opinion our staff has taken exactly the correct steps
1534274 any time there is a child death it is totally unacceptable
1534275 theres no federal labor provisions that requires they receive any minimum payment
1534276 going to make it worse for us well have to fly from lax and the lines there are 10 times worse
1534277 they had pretty good fares and i could fly home nonstop i am going to have to find another way
1534278 the business community will take a bit of a hit here in its effort to get to destinations important to them
1534279 the big question is going to be how that affects fares
1534280 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1534281 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1534282 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1534283 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1534284 i think its more of a nod to experience and seniority
1534285 the ultimate goal is to be able to go there with the first team and im going to have the opportunity to do that be out there with my guys
1534286 i just want to have fun and execute move the ball down the field
1534287 the power cut was confined to the buildings management system in the terminal building where it affected power and air conditioning however in terms of navigation the radar tower and runway lights were all working
1534288 airport management would like to thank staff the airlines and the travelling public for their understanding and co operation during todays power outage
1534289 would have to move to ballot members on pursuing these by other means
1534290 in formulating the precise claim in each bank we will of course factor in the particular circumstances of each business and the change agenda being sought by senior management however inflation proofing our members terms and conditions will underpin each claim

1534293 this was classic ger trying to get help from halfway around the world for a gravely ill pakistani man whom he had only recently befriended human beings dont come any better than gerard mcdonnell
1534294 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off
1534295 when i did see it i knew it was going to be that bad
1534296 for sports like triathlon it might play a little bit more of a role but you will just have to deal with whatever is there
1534297 its a little smoggy here but im not coughing up a lung or anything like that
1534298 it might look bad on tv but as far as the athletes are concerned no one is dying the air quality is fine were still going to swim well
1534299 we literally have to suck it up and get on with it
1534300 weve taken every precaution possible the last few months but decided it was a matter of getting on with it
1534301 very much aware that the project has to be completed by 2010
1534302 this project the kildare line will be delivered and it will be delivered on time and within budget

1534304 we are now witnessing the culmination of years of soft option politics from brian cowen

1534308 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1534309 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1534310 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1534311 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1534312 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1534313 im especially pleased with the way the market is aligning with incentives for adoption of our electronic solutions from the federal government payers and others

1534316 it feels like its been several years since the show was on
1534317 i basically didnt make anything up this is a documentary
1534318 this is a little bit different there is a fantastical premise but it is just people
1534319 it gives people the idea that were somehow failing or a niche show that nobody will get
1534320 but the enthusiasm i adore and the weariness is lets face it earned
1534321 got a new band but theyre younger and better looking
1534322 theyve been great so far i couldnt ask for more
1534323 we were the last at every stage we were the last pilot to be picked up
1534324 i think the network has confidence in the show weve always been the anchor of the night
1534325 perhaps its a measure of our desperation that hes back
1534326 perhaps some more emmy voters got wise to it because of the cbs run
1534327 because it was on cbs people thought it would be accessible and not as scary
1534328 committed to helping ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year
1534329 thousands of hours putting together monster models but it was largely for the glue
1534330 quoting movies means less work for us because we have less dialogue to write
1534331 i dont think theres more we could have done to get people to vote in advance
1534332 if we run at this pace well come out higher than i expected
1534333 my husband fight one and i fight the other one

1534335 i pepper with my pepper spray again both of them

1534350 no s si se aprobar o no el ingreso de las semillas transg nicas a per pero lo nico que puedo decir es que a nivel gen tico un cultivo transg nico es capaz de contaminar a otro cultivo org nico
1534351 colocar un conjunto de productos transg nicos tiene el riesgo de contaminar a otros productos que no lo son entonces se tienen que tomar una serie de medidas por ejemplo cortinas que impidan la transmisi n de los genes transg nicos a otros productos que uno quiere seguir considerando como org nicos
1534352 los pa ses que tienen experiencia en este tema han analizado y definido las zonas donde se realizar n estos cultivos adem s han establecido los sistemas adecuados para los mismos
1534353 efectivamente estamos ingresando a un mundo donde los transg nicos son importantes pero tambi n debemos ser conscientes que la gran diversidad peruana debe ser protegida
1534354 a nivel de productos org nicos todav a estamos muy alejados de los rendimientos normales por qu no empezamos a levantar los rendimientos de estos alimentos que podr an ser muy rentables

1534363 no eres mejor porque te elogien ni peor porque te vituperen
1534364 do you not yet understand that whatsoever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the sewer
1534365 be not anxious for what you shall eat or what you shall drink or what you shall wear isnt life more than food and the body more than clothing
1534366 man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god
1534367 the kingdom of god is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
1534368 your body is the temple of the holy spirit therefore glorify god in your body
1534369 the path to good health is paved with unhealthy actions
1534370 thank you so much for be a die hard runner
1534371 why am i alive heaven sounded so peaceful and even thought that i just had too much pain in me and i even believed that the world would better off without 300 pound me around

1534373 im not what everybody thinks that i am believe it or not im a simple country girl i might buy expensive shoes
1534374 but im definitely a simple country girl and this album will hopefully give people a sense of who jessica is again
1534375 im so blessed to be able to sing with her on it she is so much a part of me finding myself as an artist
1534376 you could take time to watch the news during that little amount of time

1534378 la fragmentaci n de las organizaciones pol ticas deviene de un conjunto de medidas que la incentivan la ley de partidos pol ticos no tiene una funci n sancionadora para quienes la incumplan ahora uno puede ver el resultado en casos como el de upp que en realidad es un partido que ten a desarrolladas pr cticas poco serias y posteriormente hemos visto el desempe o de muchos de sus congresistas
1534379 y que por lo tanto pueden hacer y deshacer seg n lo crean conveniente

1534391 graham had some guidelines and his preparation has improved over the past couple of weeks
1534392 we have seen that we know he can do it and its just a matter of doing it for a longer basis now
1534393 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1534394 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1534395 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1534396 i would not carry a mask i do not see a need for that this is not a measure i would recommend unless you have a particular disorder

1534413 each year we take out seven of the finest rams to trade at the feast of weeks then we go through the rest of the lambs and choose the finest for the market here
1534414 it is not often i find such good choices most shepherds seem to pick the worst of their animals and fluff them up to pass off on unsuspecting pilgrims
1534415 can you tell me of the tragedy that took place here last year when the little boys were murdered by herod
1534416 yes sir my child my firstborn was one of them
1534417 ive even thought of moving away so she can forget
1534418 if you decide you want to do that please come to me
1534419 i am very much in need of a shepherd of your caliber my flocks are large and i just lost my chief shepherd in fact i came this year hoping to find someone just like you my home is far enough away from bethlehem to relieve your wifes mind and the land around arimathea is beautiful i spend a good part of every year here in jerusalem on temple business and i need someone of your ability to look after my flocks while im away
1534420 thank you for your offer it just might be what ive been praying for how soon would you have to know
1534421 i am with child jacob we will begin two new lives this year
1534422 id rather you didnt talk to jehovah about this one jacob i believe the less he knows about it the better
1534423 dont say that rachel i know you have not yet found your peace with god but dont jeopardize the safety of our child by your foolish words
1534424 jeopardize his safety how safe was barak what did our words do for him
1534425 please beloved dont torture yourself with this bitterness enjoy the blessing of a new life both for ourselves and for the life growing in your womb
1534426 youre right jacob i will put away the talk of death it is a time for life
1534427 the soldiers herods soldiers did this jacob theyve killed all the little boys they could find all of bethlehem is grieving
1534428 herod found out about jesus jacob someone told him a prince of israel had been born in bethlehem and he wanted him dead
1534429 oh no his son wasnt killed jehovah sent his son to egypt it was our sons who died his son he saved our sons he would not
1534430 leave me i must wash and clean myself before the priests come
1534431 i cannot leave you here surely there will be other children to rock in this cradle
1534432 daughter if your mother were here she would tell you to go and not look back you will find your peace there i just pray that orpha will find hers here
1534433 be brave sister and know that we are not letting this go like cowards there are those of us who have taken a vow of vengeance on those who murdered our sons herod will not live to enjoy his throne
1534434 be careful reuben i couldnt bear to lose you too
1534435 i wish i could ask you to protect and shelter us jehovah
1534436 its always a little frightening to come back alone with the money taken in at passover
1534437 with what little we have left after taxes you mean
1534438 how else could we travel in the presence of two such beautiful children
1534439 they could very well be eli said they came in late yesterday afternoon
1534440 but i wanted my wife rachel to see the child is it all right for us to visit
1534441 i remember meeting you on the road yesterday you told us where to find the inn and gave me a drink the innkeeper and his wife have been very kind to us
1534442 please tell me about him did you know he would be special did you know angels would announce his birth
1534443 it was an angel who told me he would be born
1534444 do you think we could see him jacob do you think they will stay awhile
1534445 in fact i came to see if rachel wanted to come to the inn with me the others went back to tell their families and check the flocks i said i would join them later
1534446 are you feeling well enough for me to go mother
1534447 oh yes rachel maybe in a day or two ill be up to visiting too they surely wont try to travel for awhile yet
1534448 ill stay here with your mother rachel you go with jacob to see this wonder
1534449 but first you must eat something jacob and rest a moment
1534450 you say the messiah has been born in a stable
1534451 surely you dont believe that all the prophets tell of a mighty king who will sit on the throne of david
1534452 think as you will my brother but i know what i saw and what i heard
1534453 watch this one sister the sun is getting to him
1534454 your doubts wont change my mind or jacobs reuben why dont you come see for yourself
1534455 we have been told you knew the man and woman who claim to have given birth to a king where have they gone
1534456 what do you mean we know of no king but herod
1534457 the people lived in that house on the south edge of town the house is empty now where did they go
1534458 i told you sir we know nothing of this matter we knew the people but we did not know they had gone
1534459 i knew those people would get us into trouble it must have something to do with those rich travelers who stopped at elis
1534460 they were herods soldiers they came to my inn asking about the kings and the christ child i told them the kings had gone and tried to stall them as long as i could i knew mary and joseph had left and i wanted to give them all the time possible eventually though i had to tell them where they were living when the soldiers came back they were furious and kept asking questions someone who was listening told them you knew them and were their friends
1534461 i was in the shadows just now as they returned to the inn
1534462 do you think that will be the end of it
1534463 we can only pray it will but rachel i think you would be safer in your own home i will come first thing in the morning and take you there
1534464 i think it is obvious that people kill people because a gun can not pull its own trigger

1534476 all expressed interest in buying our ground and air bp assets and operations to grow their presence in the south west pacific
1534477 the second reason is that bp needs to make a decision on its investment strategy for this part of the world while we have always invested in the business to ensure its ongoing operational success we appreciate the investment demands on the business are growing as the business grows
1534478 it is important to emphasise that our south west pacific business is a strong business and bp is well respected in the countries we operate in
1534479 perhaps the information is available what it lacks is a vigorous and cohesive co ordination strategy i am sure there will be discussions on this matter during the tvet symposium
1534480 the institutions being the suppliers it goes without saying then that the demands can only be identified through the availability of labour market information
1534481 some enterprises are reluctant to provide practical experience to tvet students
1534482 given that there are risks in this practice i suppose we can all understand the reasons why
1534483 my film is not a thesis film i hope it makes people reflect upon the consequences of wrong choices
1534484 i dont understand why american and israeli directors who speak of their countries are considered necessary filmmakers
1534485 while those in italy who speak of their country are accused of defamation
1534486 were tired of the folkloric imagine that television shows so often present of crime
1534487 however its political value lies in the language not the content
1534488 i wanted the film to have a strong emotional impact and to give the audience the sensation of being there of smelling the smells of those places
1534489 blaming the architecture is too easy near cannes i saw the same immense building by the same architect franz di salvo maintained as a great luxury palace
1534490 with a lot of collaboration from the local people they were always around me they have me precious advice friendships were formed i was moved by the profound humanity of the many who aspire to a normal legal life and are instead crushed by crime
1534491 but for having named names the bosses of the camorra during its presentation the camorristi were perhaps even flattered that we shot a film about them in their area they didnt disturb us they understood that this was best for their business
1534492 nunzia was very helpful in choosing the actors i was oriented towards strong peasant faces but she explained to me that the camorristi looked like that 20 years ago while today they look like television guests they depilate themselves wear earrings they want to look like football players so i re cast the film
1534493 a boss of 30 years worn out by the wars between various clans who looked a veteran of the war in iraq told me that only in jail could he rest his favourite film is the gladiator because he feels like an heir to the roman emperors certainly not the american mafia
1534494 after the success at cannes and the box office results i feel torn im immensely satisfied about the recognition the work has received but id like to ask everyone to be prudent at the same time
1534495 it is wrong to condemn italian cinema for earning 3 less at the box office but it is just as wrong to applaud it and celebrate excessively this is merely sensationalism perhaps these are just a series of coincidences the director of the cannes festival thierry fremont could have invited just one of the two italian winners the italian juror could have been unfavorable towards the two directors and if we dont achieve the same results at venice perhaps people will speak of the death of italian cinema
1534496 unfortunately the state does not support long term perspectives and yet thats all that cinema needs there is a tendency for everyone to follow the same path if a film is successful similar films are made this is fine for the commercial film industry but independent producers should base their work on previous results you can achieve good results even by making mistakes

1534501 the truth is simply this i began hearing a few months ago that steve jobs was very sick i wasnt sure if these rumors were true or not then i saw how he looked at wwdc and it was like having the wind knocked out of me i just couldnt carry on i hope and pray that hes not sick but for now i just cant carry on with the fake steve character

1534519 three small ships carrying 300 frenchmen led by rene de laudonniere anchored in the river known today as the st johns on june 30 1564 construction of a triangular shaped fort was begun with the help of a local tribe of timucuan indians fort caroline was home for this hardy group of huguenots their strong religious motivations inspired them
1534520 although they died as martyrs 444 years ago the sacrifice of the french huguenots in florida still stands in eternity and the price has been paid in the heavens for our freedom on this land here on earth praise god they loved not their lives unto death
1534521 an often overlooked site of interest in the u s capitol is a historical map that is shown in the ceiling of the cox corridor in the house wing of the capitol building titled fort st augustine this mural is in the ceiling of the corridor and shows the dates of the founding of the first three cities in our land st augustine 1565 jamestown 1607 and plymouth 1620
1534522 the spanish conquistadors founded st augustine florida on september 8 1565 while they carried out the command of king philip ii of spain to do away with the french problem on land that spain had claimed
1534523 later the spanish built the castillo de san marcos a fearsome looking fortress designed to serve as a signal to all others that this land belonged to spain the castillo de san marcos which took 30 years to build is also shown on this map
1534524 st augustine florida is the oldest city in america today having been founded by europeans who have resided there ever since

1534532 theres a lot of discomfort among about a dozen out of the 58 county clerks that ive talked to
1534533 they dont want to go outside of the constitution they dont want to go outside of the statutes they know that doing it by the book means that marriage is still between a man and a woman and they dont really believe in homosexual marriage because most county clerks reflect the values of most californians he continued
1534534 it should clearly be stayed because the people are going to vote in november with regards to the california marriage protection amendment
1534535 thats a matter that in fact we addressed before the california supreme court which they denied however the california court of appeals has a separate independent obligation to consider this matter as well
1534536 the california supreme court only addressed two of the many statutes regarding marriage you cant simply address two statutes when theres literally hundreds of others all of which reference men and women male and female husband and wife all of which have to be addressed
1534537 the leadership tried to deny that this would happen but now the truth is out our respect for the church of england will erode unless we see a return to traditional teaching
1534538 they called me and said theyd like me to come down and audition for the lead role they gave me nine scenes to read and all of them were pretty intense emotionally i had to be angry frustrated and tense i had to be weeping and crying asking for forgiveness i had to be strong and in command of a fire rescue scene i really wanted to do this part and god opened the door
1534539 this role is very different from anything else ive played people will see me do things ive never done before the range of emotions in this character has been very challenging

1534544 ive learned that acting is very challenging but marines are always up for a challenge when they announced the movie i prayed about it and asked my wife if i should audition i read for the part and i knew that if it were the lords will id be in the movie
1534545 this commissioning represents a powerful spiritual transaction taking place in the invisible world with this in mind i take the apostolic authority that god has given me and i decree to todd bentley your power will increase your authority will increase your favor will increase your influence will increase your revelation will increase

1534547 i am no church historian but i do not know of any other time in history since the book of acts have so many different apostles and so many different prophets and movements and leaders been represented

1534565 obama is shallow hes an empty suit he doesnt have the relevant experience to work the country out of its problems and john mccain does ive been advocating an action policy to solve these problems and thats resonating with voters thats why ill say mccain is going to carry massachusetts and im going to beat john kerry
1534566 because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed
1534567 finally i want to give a pledge to you on a political level and im speaking for myself not focus on the family which is a non political organization i can just tell you that i have determined that for the rest of my life however long god lets me live on this earth i will never cast one vote for any man or woman who would kill one innocent baby
1534568 ive criticized sen mccains continuing support for federal funding for embryonic stem cell research that bothers me a lot it leads to killing of babies very tiny babies but they are human beings
1534569 theres nothing dishonorable in a person rethinking his or her positions especially in a constantly changing political contest
1534570 he really dealt us a low blow we thought with his mccain feingold campaign reform bill which became law thanks to president bush signing it into law that law kept organizations like ours away from broadcast ads that mentioned a candidate by name 30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election in other words those of us who have things to say on the issues about candidates we couldnt say them in front of elections the very time people want to hear that really frustrated us about this candidate this senator
1534571 hes not in favor of traditional marriage and i pray that we dont get stuck with him i would not vote for john mccain under any circumstances
1534572 i am committed never again to cast a vote for a politician who would kill one innocent baby these little ones have no defense except that which we provide for them never will i use my influence however remotely to support the shedding of their blood
1534573 some would ask shouldnt we vote for the lesser of two evils when the choice is between pro abortion candidates i believe not to compromise on so fundamental an issue gives pro life politicians parties no incentive to defend the pro life position by voting for a moderate pro abortionist who might be more desirable in the short run we squander our influence on decision makers rather when a significant number of votes are cast for a third party pro life candidate even in a losing cause that fact will not go unnoticed by political leaders they will be more likely to court our support in the future especially if they lost the last election thats the way the game is played
1534574 ive criticized sen mccains continuing support for federal funding for embryonic stem cell research that bothers me a lot it leads to killing of babies very tiny babies but they are human beings

1534577 either give up that which you fear to lose so it no longer holds any power over you or consider what you will still have if your fear comes to pass after all
1534578 if you did lose all youd built you would still keep the experience and knowledge that youve gained up to this point wouldnt you
1534579 you know not what you are given but forever will you know what has been taken away from you
1534580 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
1534581 throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have acted the indifference of those who should have known better the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most that has made it possible for evil to triumph
1534582 the world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave its the age old struggle the roar of the crowd on the one side and the voice of your conscience on the other
1534583 i will be as harsh as truth and uncompromising as justice i am in earnest i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard
1534584 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1534585 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1534606 for him mccain the relationship with our southern neighbors is not just a series of briefings by an outside policy adviser because he needed to have a policy position on latin america
1534607 u s policy can no longer be based on the assumption that the united states is the most important outside actor in latin america if there was an era of u s hegemony in latin america it is over
1534608 it is not enough to come to the defense of freedom with epic and intermittent efforts when it is threatened at moments that appear critical every moment is critical for the defense of freedom
1534609 it was a great american jos mart who reminded us that we americans are one in origin in hope and in danger

1534613 the fact that these clandestine meetings have been going on behind peoples backs has completely caught me by surprise
1534614 i thought the provincial unions were working together in terms of looking at the air new zealand cup review and here we are hearing about nine unions wanting to go it alone in a competition that will see the demise of the franchises which is not in the interests of tasman thats for sure
1534615 im only hearing through the media that tasman doesnt have a place in the air new zealand cup in 2009 i havent heard that confirmed one way or the other by the new zealand rugby union so whether its media speculation or people reading into the comments of nzru chief executive steve tew as far as im concerned the decision hasnt been made
1534616 go back and spit some numbers out so that we can get a better idea of some of our costs outside of the competition
1534617 a technical requirement to provide information on allocation of regional fuel tax revenues to projects
1534618 this is the only tax that has been consulted on like this
1534619 people opposed tolls and road charges but because this is for electrification there is strong support
1534620 if the aa didnt even engage in the consultation process they cant turn around now and bleat
1534621 i believe we are now further up the mountain than anyone has been before there is still a way to go but we can see the summit ahead of us
1534622 the tax cuts coming in on october 1 will feed some demand back into the economy the droughts over the drought had quite a big impact on the two quarters this year
1534623 the dollars come back somewhat so thatll be a help in the export sector the export sector was quite a strong contributor to negative growth in the first two quarters of this year
1534624 in a softening economy people are going to be very hesitant about price increases and things like that so thats given us enough room to cut
1534625 ive done everything i can and im very confident ive managed the problem ive had well i wouldnt be doing it unless i thought it was as good as it could be
1534626 it just goes back to what you do around any other racing situation its the olympics you just want to make sure youre not rushing around too much and getting too caught up in the hype
1534627 you keep things very simple thats what has always worked well for me in the past
1534628 i draw huge confidence from what ive done in the past
1534629 ive always been in the race mentally ive never let myself down were up against some really tough crews its a huge challenge and its cut throat im ready for that
1534630 as far as personalities go nath and i get on really well but in the boat youve just got to make sure you do everything together on the flip side of that youve got the benefit of having another person involved and that enhances what you might get out of yourself personally
1534631 were really happy with where theyre at we think were getting close to what we want now
1534632 but i treat those results with caution i know theres two or three crews youre just not going to see till the last part of the olympic final thats how its always been they perform poorly in early regattas but always come up for the big ones
1534633 were making some progress in some areas but were not going to be satisfied until we see perfection out there were far away from that
1534634 obviously when you get the pads on it gets a little more physical
1534635 but its been pretty physical out there for having no pads guys are working their technique and their fundamentals theres a lot of learning going on
1534636 their heads are spinning some guys are a little more comfortable than others and thats to be expected its a good group a couple of them might have a chance to help us out well see how that plays out
1534637 it is actually these discrimination tests that give rise to qserp in the first place
1534638 at the end when the game is over when the computer is cooling off you know whether you passed the irs nondiscrimination tests or not
1534639 at some point in the future the irs may well take the position
1534640 they include the amendment with other amendments and dont make it obvious
1534641 under existing rules theres little we can do anyway if congress doesnt like it it can change the rules
1534642 i look at it as greed and taking care of the top echelons
1534643 the purpose is to pay them the benefit theyve earned
1534644 despite all the advertising we see somehow the message doesnt seem to be getting through that bad driving and alcohol results in injury and death
1534645 i dont feel he is a bad person i think he lives in his own hell he made a terrible decision a bad choice he has faced up to it

1534947 and i do solemnly swear that whatsoever the author shall have called any novel submitted to me and however suitable his title shall be i will immediately alter it to one of my own choosing thus asserting by a single stroke the dignity of my office and my own independence wodehouses jab is curious not so much that he takes one at american publishers who frequently changed his uk titles sometimes somewhat charmlessly but more curious is his reference to milne by the time this book and later introduction had been written milne was well known as one of wodehouses most aggressive critics he accused wodehouse of being a traitor for wodehouses ill advised broadcasts for the germans during the time wodehouse was a prisoner of war wodehouse got his own back by creating some fairly fanglike parodies of milnes verse but perhaps its not all that surprising despite their personal argument both continued to enjoy and appreciate the work of the other milne passed his love of wodehouse onto his children which means that at some point we might picture christopher robin reading wodehouse alongside pooh a stuffed animal reading wodehouse wodehouse wraps up the introduction to french leave with for some reason french leave got by and joined all the other french leaves i can only hope it will be found worthy to be included in the list of the best hundred books entitled french leave oh surely there cant be more than one or two huh whoda thunkit the novel itself is a bit of an unusual departure for wodehouse rather than a young charming man as its protagonist a pair of young charming women the trent sisters jo and terry accompanied by their older slightly sour sister kate take center stage when les soeurs trent come into some money from the sale of their late fathers play to a television producer theres no way theyll take sensible kates suggestion to bank the green for a rainy day nope the trent girls are heading to the seaside resorts of france for an all out holiday and if they happen to fall in love and find themselves suitable husbands all the better a vacation complicating their love pursuits isnt that always the case are some of wodehouses most continental characters a rarity for this very english of writers wodehouse has a wonderful teaser at the end of the first chapter as the trent girls prepare to leave their new york chicken farm for les plages de fran ais the new moon hung in the sky like a silver sickle and terry as she stood in the little garden outside the kitchen door bowed to it three times she found herself a little breathless she was wondering what the future had in store for her among the things which the future had in store for her were that exuberant old gentleman the marquis de maufringneuse his son the comte descrignon mrs winthrop pegler of park avenue and newport frederick butch carpenter majority stockholder in the well known sparkling table water fizzo j russell clutterbuck of the publishing house winch and clutterbuck and last but not least the bonne bouche as it were pierre alexandre boissonade commissaire of police theyre all wonderfully colorful characters but focus for un moment upon le marquis de maufringneuse or as hes known throughout the novel old nick a rogue a little bit of a con man perpetually down on his luck but never down in his spirits old nick is the anti uncle fred of french leave responsible for much of the chaos and consternation not to mention hampering the romantic life of his son jeff the comte descrignon jeff is like so many wodehouse heroes an honest likeable writer typing away on the great american french novel and just on the verge of hitting it big when publisher j russell clutterbuck please dont say it three times fast falls in love with the novel as much as jeff falls in love with terry trent and she with him although theres much plot in the way to untangle before they can clasp each other in their arms and murmur sweet french coos of love in each others ears much of the novels humor comes from what seems like an unusual character for wodehouse the commisonaire of police pierre alexandre boissonade a clouseau esque character with an inflated sense of his own gallic importance and an mild streak of larceny as one of wodehouses few pure french characters it might be easy to sneer and turn up ones nose at his poking fun at the french but lets face it the british and the americans come in for just the same sort of good natured parody in this novel and other wodehouses and if youre offended youre paying too much attention this is a light and frothy romance set among the hotels casinos and beaches of southern france add to the mix and stir vigorously the usual imposing matrons and befuddled millionaires and garnish with a love story for the other trent girls as well and its the perfect celebration of la vie en rose you can almost see this as a light hearted 1950s romantic comedy audrey hepburn as terry gregory peck as jeff and maybe maurice chevalier as old nick probably with a soundtrack by henry mancini too now that i think of it id certainly see it especially with slightly risqu scenes like this hoy said the voice terry was a sweet natured girl but even sweet natured girls can be ruffled the shock had made her bite her tongue and she spoke with a good deal of asperity whos that you scared me stiff she said thought fearing that the rebuke would be wasted on what was presumably an untutored frenchman the voice uttered a whoop of joy gosh for petes sake are you american i am thank go i thought i should have to explain the situation in french and i only know about two words of french what situation would that be im in a spot its like this a sudden alarm sized the voice hoy it said it seemed to be his favourite word you arent coming any closer are you not if you dont want me to you see i havent any pants on any what pants trousers terry was conscious of a quick thrill she was a girl who liked things to be interesting and she found this human drama into which she had stumbled fraught with interest still among the usual humorous dialogue and funny descriptions and perhaps fitting for a country alive with the sound of the language of more than the usual romance and romantic writing in french leave did you have a good swim asked kate splendid

1535098 when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord the priests in their vestments and with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals took their places to praise the lord as prescribed by david king of israel
1535099 listen to my prayer for mercy as i cry out to you for help as i lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary

1535106 all of john mccains shirts are too big the shoulders are too wide the body is too big and the sleeves are too full it makes him look smaller and sickly like hes lost too much weight most of his shirts fit like this
1535107 johns mccains jackets tend to be too big its unlikely because he needs it for his gut theyre just poor choices the shoulders are too big and the sleeves are way too long look at how his sleeves are folded just to have it at the right length
1535108 john mccains suit size is too big the shoulders are too wide making him look smaller his sweaters make him look like a grandfather not a presidential candidate he can do that if and after he wins the white house the sweater says i need to keep my old bones warm even in the dead heat of summer if hes truly in need of a little warmth a 3 piece suit would be a better choice he can stay warm and still look more presidential a vest is a much better option
1535109 john mccain can also find better fitting casual wear that wont make him look so wide mccain needs to dress sharper always not because hes the shorter candidate but because he has a beautiful slender wife until he dresses better she steals every shot they are in together hes not taking advantage of how beautiful his wife looks by dressing better they should look like the first couple already she already looks like the first lady

1535111 actually we wanted you to give up trying to be righteous on your own it was a mirror to reveal just how filthy your face gets when you live independently
1535112 who think they are made righteous by following the rules
1535113 but can you clean your face with the same mirror that shows you how dirty you are there is no mercy or grace in rules not even for one mistake thats why jesus fulfilled all of it for you so that it no longer has jurisdiction over you and the law that once contained impossible demands thou shall not actually becomes a promise we fulfill in you
1535114 but keep in mind that if you live your life alone and independently the promise is empty jesus laid the demand of the law to rest it no longer has any power to accuse or command jesus is both the promise and its fulfillment
1535115 are you saying that i dont have to follow the rules
1535116 yes in jesus you are not under any law all things are lawful
1535117 those who are afraid of freedom are those who can not trust us to live in them trying to keep the law is actually a declaration of independence a way of keeping control

1535124 for many years parents have worried about televisions glamorization of destructive sexual behavior
1535125 this important new report suggests another cause for concern the de glamorization of marriage statistics show that the overwhelming majority of americans feel satisfied and fulfilled by their marriages the notion that sex outside of marriage is inherently more exciting more important more worthy as the subject of storytelling is a toxic message for parents and children alike
1535126 behaviors that were once seen as fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the stamp of approval by the television industry
1535127 the investment is there but we need the jpepa in our partnerships because our japanese partners will provide the users and suppliers

1535142 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1535143 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1535144 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1535145 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1535146 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1535147 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1535148 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1535149 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice

1535204 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1535205 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1535206 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1535207 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1535222 good now lets say you know something about textiles and the two of you get into a long conversation where both of you learn much from each other you learn about the origin of the garment the yarn used the dyes the name of the artist and so on he learns about how fabric is made in your country how distribution works and so on in the course of this you get to know each other what happens to the price
1535223 maybe i want to pay him more and he wants to charge me less
1535224 transaction still matters of course so does conversation but the biggest wedge in the social pie of the public marketplace is relationship price is less set than found and the context for finding prices is both conversation and relationship in many cases relationship is the primary concern not price

1535252 reflections on the problematic protestant system of private judgment and the vast difference in catholic epistemology
1535253 if one accepts those two and fairly considers all of the competing arguments side by side i think it is no contest one will become catholic or possibly orthodox
1535254 how can you take the inspiration of the bible for granted
1535255 without validation from catholic tradition you have no meaningful way to determine what is inspired and what isnt

1535296 everyone keeps looking at internet because internet advertising has been growing dramatically 20 to 30 each year since 2003
1535297 all everyone talks about is internet advertising and its on the same level dollar wise as radio advertising and behind print and magazine despite everyone talking about print dying
1535298 the reason for raising the issue of print dollars is not because print advertising is not particularly for newspapers and certain magazines
1535299 the point was to show that as much as internet advertising has been growing rapidly it has not yet supplanted print media in total revenues even with the declines print media has been facing the real issue facing many magazines and newspapers is that many of them find themselves competing for a stagnating or shrinking share of the ad market as well as online alternatives print media definitely has challenges to face but they are clearly still a major force in the ad industry

1535348 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1535349 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1535350 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1535351 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1535352 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves

1535365 i dont know it might be a nice changeup itll be coachs decision i didnt really think too much into it as far as who started the green white game saturday and well see what the decision is for cleveland
1535366 sometimes its one guy has a better day than the other and then it could flip flip in practice flip during the course of a day

1535402 in some respects the bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods
1535403 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1535404 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1535405 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1535406 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating

1535408 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1535409 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1535410 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1535411 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail

1535413 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years

1535513 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody who knows anything about the game knows that
1535514 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
1535515 and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore
1535516 its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago

1535523 important questions about obamas judgment consistency and honesty are not being asked let alone answered
1535524 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1535525 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1535526 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1535527 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1535528 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1535529 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1535530 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1535531 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1535532 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1535533 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children

1535537 the mayor seems like the kind of person you could just have a conversation with
1535538 all the things shes taught me ive been implementing we sort of bounce ideas off each other
1535539 ladan has an idea and then she finds out how we can do it
1535540 shes created so many different partnerships when you have leaders like that you really want to support them in being powerful with what they do
1535541 this course is rough hot rocky dusty with very steep uphill terrain and narrow trails

1535544 this is my first time here but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom
1535545 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody who knows anything about the game knows that

1535552 production has not reached the critical stage the company is very reasonable thanks to my achievements in the past so although i do get pressurised thats not happened yet on the current project and thats something i feel gratitude for that the company gives us the opportunity to focus by giving us time
1535553 its a terrible waste of mana that at a time when maori have a real chance to determine who is in government we are losing people off the roll
1535554 its a terrible indictment on this country that people dont want to stay here its a terrible loss to families iwi and the country
1535555 we are sending contractors up to work the east coast and to the polytech and the wananga weve got electoral stands outside the warehouse and at burger king and were sending all the information to maori media

1535569 they didnt even have the courtesy to contact mr marshall directly or his lawyer the league appears to be more concerned about its image than treating its players with dignity and respect the best part of this is we get to appeal this suspension to the very commissioner who chose to suspend him in this fashion
1535570 i dont want to talk about retirement yet but hopefully when its done its done and hopefully youve had a good solid career and you can limp away from it
1535571 i started out on a line with top forwards saku koivu and chris higgins got pushed back in the lineup and then all of a sudden i was out of the lineup
1535572 to be honest i still dont know what happened all i ever heard from the coaches was shoot the puck work hard it will all work out but
1535573 this is all about me wanting to play for the packers and if the packers dont want me to play for the packers the packers shouldnt be allowed to tell me where i can and cant play

1535575 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
1535576 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue

1535587 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1535588 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1535589 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1535590 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1535591 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1535592 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1535593 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1535594 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1535595 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance

1535657 we have used an innovative approach to the way it recognises signs so we can minimise the computing power needed to read the signs
1535658 but there is a lot of difference having something that works in a lab and can detect a lot of different signs at speed and having it packaged in a system with a camera built into the vehicle
1535659 i think an audible alert would be the best way to go and backed up by a visible sign as to what speed limit was detected then you have two of the drivers senses alerted

1535664 difficult if not impossible to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies
1535665 live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct
1535666 reasonable for the state to conclude that it will decrease the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the product thereby decreasing demand
1535667 allow persons to be convicted in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in the production
1535668 leave unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the governments interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones
1535669 an offer to provide or request to receive virtual child pornography is not prohibited by the statute a crime is committed only when the speaker believes or intends the listener to believe that the subject of the proposed transaction depicts real children it is simply not true that this means a protected category of expression will inevitably be suppressed simulated child pornography will be as available as ever so long as it is offered and sought as such and not as real child pornography

1535674 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1535675 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1535676 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time

1535681 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
1535682 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1535683 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1535684 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1535685 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
1535686 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
1535687 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
1535688 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
1535689 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them
1535690 when we first came here al qaeda spread rumors that we were here to occupy the city and that we are shiite and were going to treat the residents badly but then the people started to realize that we were dealing with them in a professional way

1535695 the biggest concern now is unemployment because it directly affects the security situation
1535696 ninety percent of the people lost their jobs as a result of the bombing
1535697 when someone finds himself without work for three years hell do anything for money even setting off explosions or killing people
1535698 unemployment is high we apply for jobs with the police and they reject us

1535703 the weakening economy prompted brand marketers to shift ad budgets to alternative media and marketing services due to stronger return on investment roi metrics and high usage among target audiences
1535704 during the 2001 recession for example brand marketers who cut budgets significantly lost market share a trend they do not want to repeat in 2008
1535705 the overall market will exhibit only minor declines as brand marketers shift budgets to alternative media that are targeted at hard to reach demographics like the youth influential and business markets
1535706 because of its ability to reach consumers with a more detailed and targeted message than traditional mass media
1535707 e mail had the highest growth in the direct marketing segment because it represents a low cost alternative to direct mail and generates a strong roi growth for television marketing primarily long form response programs or infomercials decelerated in 2007 due primarily to overall television rating declines as a result of the writers strike

1535720 as if there arent enough lawyers out there inventing lawsuits now were going to invite the public to do so
1535721 i think this is nothing more than a referral service
1535722 it encourages if not creates lawsuits our countrys courts are clogged with unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits which delay if not obstruct the access to courts of people that really need to get there that have serious legal grievances
1535723 with our system they can either find a lawyer or find out by talking to our lawyers that they dont really have an interest in that case
1535724 i dont think whocanisue com is going to by itself increase the number of lawsuits there are but it may make people more aware of what their rights are
1535725 its a good thing to the extent people are vindicating their legal rights to the extent they didnt years ago
1535726 hes not looking around in awe like a rookie im pretty sure he probably did when he got to the hotel down in texas this past weekend because it was a pretty nice hotel a lot better than the ones they stay in at triple a

1535730 to a dedicated pacifist war is horrible is a basic premise and is interpreted literally it follows that no recognizably human being could be a professional soldier but professional soldiers exist therefore they must be essentially depraved and brutalized people
1535731 whats wrong with advocating that war is noble beautiful and necessary i agree wholeheartedly any such view is pure horse apples but i will not go along with the liberal contention that no one has a right to advocate the eating of horse apples

1535764 tiger woods is interested in his reputation in being green he has to be pushed to do even better
1535765 the fact that the albany development will site its golf course on top of the islands largest water lens is indefensible

1535788 but the market is still very nervous weve been caught before and had spikes about three or four times

1535791 she was three to four years old she had straight dark brown hair in a ponytail her hair reached her shoulders or possibly a little further she had a pallid face and huge eyes which were very noticeable
1535792 she had a dark look but i dont think she had dark brown eyes i think they were green brown what caught my attention was the fact that she showed little or no emotion
1535793 then the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is i answered that her mother was a little bit further back in the shop and she answered she is not my mummy
1535794 i asked her who the woman was and she said she is a stranger she took me from my mummy

1535815 the study session is not a forum for the public to ask questions its an opportunity for the board to receive information take a tour and then ask questions because were holding that tour and presentation in an open meeting were inviting the public to join us
1535816 i look at it as if it was a city council meeting and they would have to run some kind of forum where they open it up for people that have questions on a certain item
1535817 i would be one of the parents who wanted to attend to see what the plans are and ask questions

1535830 shaping the virtualization congress agenda is one of the most challenging tasks ever done at virtualization info we have to grant equal exposure to all the first class speakers that will present on stage we have to balance the contents in a way that every attendee will have a great show no matter what technology hes most interested in and we have to ignite that competition that is healthy for the customers and the entire market i think that so far the resulting program is matching all these goals and the event is definitively one that id like to attend as a delegate
1535831 we know that we have sold many substandard vehicles to unsuspecting customers we also treated many of them badly when they came back for care all the while putting the screws to our suppliers so that we could pay our workforce our dividends and our bk proof pensions we are sorry we promise to do better
1535832 fusion malibu sebring ok you can laugh at that last one none are as good as the camcord and they only steal sales from each other

1535834 the presbyterian global fellowship seeks to be a parallel society living a new vision for the church within the pc usa

1535847 this is how we always envisioned episodic gaming monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality
1535848 our last game topped out at 8 bits weve heard this one might reach 9 or 10
1535849 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1535850 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1535851 at its meeting today the board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7 25 per cent

1535863 assuming no other business changes the loss of the asgard business would have around a 60 million impact or approximately eight per cent on tower australias 700 million in force book
1535864 there will be no profit impact in the 2008 year and a part impact in the 2009 year depending on when the transition takes place
1535865 there is no immediate prospect of an improvement in the highly challenging industry conditions that pacifica is currently experiencing
1535866 consequently pacifica expects to report a further operating loss in the second half of 2008
1535867 there is also no short term expectation of an increase in locally manufactured large passenger car volumes in australia
1535868 in response to the lasting shift in demand towards smaller more fuel efficient cars in the automotive industry pacifica continues to actively pursue initiatives that further improve its capacity utilisation
1535869 approximately 29 million of the sales decline was attributable to the adverse translation effect of a stronger australian dollar with the balance reflecting reduced underlying light truck volumes as consumers responded to the steep rise in petrol prices
1535870 the majority of the sales decrease impacted the knoxville plant where first half volume reductions were exacerbated by the effect of the strike activity at american axle which caused significant disruption to the truck production of pacificas major end customer general motors
1535871 the asian business remains profitable but lower export volumes to north america have served to reduce earnings
1535872 considerable effort is being applied to attracting increased custom from the local market to lift the capacity utilisation of the foundry operation at dalian in china

1535876 it wasnt that long ago that people were saying that oil would go up to 200 a barrel with no stopping and what were finding is that the rules of economics play hold

1535878 one of the things that had driven the market south from its rally point of april to the lows of just two weeks ago was the fear that the federal reserve was going to have to raise federal interest rates to combat what was perceived to be an inflation problem

1535880 it really surprised us to discover that it also showed the four year cycle of ancient greek games including the olympic games

1535885 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1535886 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles
1535887 the way we think about it at thq is we plan our business around each of those platforms not around the cycle
1535888 were refining it considerably pretty much as significant an overhaul as dark void underwent from its first announcement to its first big reveal
1535889 i have seen a new build recently though its coming along nicely
1535890 we have reached our time limit to find a solution that would help us keep the fury servers open sadly no solution has been found and so we have no alternative than to shut the servers
1535891 to the auran team who put their heart and soul into making fury thanks for your efforts as i said many times before we need to be much better than the competition to have a chance of succeeding we gave it everything we had and history now judges that it still wasnt good enough
1535892 whilst this marks the end of the fury chapter who knows what the future may bring there were many gems hidden within fury and many lessons learned hopefully one day the full potential can be realized in some other form
1535893 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1535894 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts amen brother amen

1535900 its obviously exciting to have clermont auvergne one of the best french rugby clubs coming to the usa
1535901 building a relationship with a professional team of their caliber is great for usa rugby and considering their connection to michelin which has its north american headquarters in south carolina there is really no better place to host such an event
1535902 its important to note that this match is not just about the teams showing up and playing the game its about the opportunities this match presents to develop the game of rugby on a whole
1535903 with coach referee and youth development opportunities usa rugby is looking forward to developing this into a legacy event we are about furthering the growth of the game and a fixture like this can only help build upon our momentum forward

1535909 oil has become the new gold a financial asset in which investors seek refuge as inflation rises and the dollar weakens
1535910 the first storm and the winds i was coming down from the box to try to get to the umpires room about 8 10 and i left a few minutes too late because it was bad
1535911 we had to kind of get against a wall with the fans here by the concession stand that goes down to our offices it would have been a tough trip down those stairs at the time it was really windy
1535912 we were very very fortunate no fans were injured that was a very dangerous situation for spectators much more than players i think wally did a good job of checking with roger as loud and as bright as some of the lightning was originally he was given assurances that it was not close i dont think anyone that was on top of it felt anything was real close until the last jolt and then it was definitely time to shut it down
1535913 i think wally did the best he could it was his call the games in his hands and obviously no one was hurt so in this case he made the right call
1535914 you dont think about that stuff when youre out there playing you dont think about how hard it is cause once you start thinking doubt and everything else youre immediately taking yourself out of the game because youre worried about slipping its throw the ball down throw strikes and dont worry about anything else
1535915 obviously theres been injuries that have been very scary with people getting hit in the face with baseballs and stuff like that
1535916 as far as weather you have to consider this one the scariest i know it was a tough situation all around there were a lot of tough decisions to be made the guys i felt sorry for were the umpires they were in a situation and needed to make tough decisions you see how the players are reacting and knowing theyre out there its a tough situation
1535917 you dont see him struggle for long long periods of time you have not seen that berkman swing i know a lot of it is he just hasnt had time off he had that thursday off after the all star game and that was basically it except for the days weve had off
1535918 yeah because i guess because im susceptible to these streaks in my career
1535919 im not sure why but its certainly one of those things that you scratch your head you cant go out there and try to hit the ball out of the ballpark you try to make good swings usually you run into them here and there but i havent done that in a while
1535920 i feel like im laying off some tough pitches like yesterday i swung at good pitches to hit i just missed that one ball to center and then ryan dempster made a couple good pitches on me with two strikes i feel like ive been identifying the ball well usually when im not going well im chasing bad pitches but i havent really been doing that
1535921 can you tell me how to get to 1603 mockingbird lane
1535922 well as a matter of fact my farm is very close to that house i would walk you there but i cant carry this lot
1535923 why dont you put the can of paint in the bucket carry the bucket in one hand put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand
1535924 lets take my shortcut and go down this alley well be there in no time
1535925 i am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me how do i know that when we get in the alley you wont hold me up against the wall pull up my skirt and have your way with me
1535926 holy smokes lady im carrying a bucket a gallon of paint two chickens and a goose how in the world could i possibly hold you up against the wall and do that
1535927 if youre not doing your thinking someone else is doing your thinking for you

1535929 these days mock outrage is used by every side of every dispute it is the result of a desperate scavenging for umbrage material and when the landscape is so littered with folks lying prostrate this isnt spontaneous mass outrage this is choreography
1535930 we might not always say what we feel in focus groups but rather what we think others might want to hear the beauty about blogs is that they are written with passion and honesty

1535932 governor you said 18 months experience wasnt enough experience as governor to be the vice president would you want to contrast that with the 143 days experience obama as senator before he decided he had enough experience to be president
1535933 andy warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame
1535934 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1535935 were not making erotic were making hard core the audience doesnt want that it wants this
1535936 it didnt take me long to figure out i had a eager audience of curious 12 year olds i found some girlie magazines photographed them and made prints that i sold it didnt occur to me at the time that i was pirating content
1535937 my first pseudonym in the business was edward marks out of respect for his work
1535938 theres always been this unspoken connection between celebrity money and fetishism in the uk
1535939 i learned early on the difference between a true fetish style and something that is phony and misunderstood
1535940 i was probably the first european adult producer to switch to video
1535941 certainly in the uk i was the first i was worried about the look for a long time and i got even more worried when i saw how some adult producers started abusing the image just pointing and shooting it looked so bad a lot of really poor fetish content got made and it damaged the market
1535942 the first time i went into a dutch adult store i knew holland was going to be good to me
1535943 that store was as big as a supermarket it took me an hour to check out all the titles in the fetish section alone
1535944 there were some stuff that went out under my banner in germany that was too strong even for me nobody got hurt but it was turning into something beyond fetish something dark
1535945 i was happy just to write and have legends like fred lincoln direct
1535946 to them it was something they had no interest in
1535947 in fact some of it is brilliant and innovative but its a tiny percentage of all the material that is labeled and marketed as fetish
1535948 i carry all this knowledge of fetish around in my head over thirty five years worth of images and moods and situations that i need to communicate to the artists i work with and through them to the fetish audience im not seeing real fetish in the majority of content out there and thats got to change
1535949 learning needs and theories that describe learning principles and processes should be reflective of underlying social environments

1535957 an acute sense of spatial composition and narrative structure which is drawing the listener into a captivating aural tale
1535958 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1535959 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1535960 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1535961 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1535962 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1535963 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1535964 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle
1535965 the boards move is nothing short of backing the japanese invasion of the korean peninsula
1535966 the u s position for decades has been not to take a position regarding sovereignty of the islands in questions wed welcome any outcome agreed by both korea and japan

1535970 estamos bien en el nimo fue un golpe duro dif cil pero ya pas el equipo siempre tiene personalidad para salir de sta hay que darle la vuelta a la p gina y corregir las cosas que estamos haciendo mal
1535971 hay que seguir trabajando m s duro ahora lo m s imporante es que nos mantenemos unidos y se ha visto que siempre en las adversidades el equipo ha sabido salir adelante

1535984 hes not a good guy but hes done extraordinary things
1535985 hes a new tsar of russia and hes dangerous in the sense that he doesnt care about civil liberties he doesnt care about free speech he cares about stability but stability is what russia needed and thats why russians adore him
1535986 under putins leadership russia reemerged as a constructive and reliable partner in shaping international relations
1535987 putin has put his country back on the map and he intends to redraw it himself
1535988 he will continue to lead his country as its prime minister and attempt to transform it into a new kind of nation beholden to neither east nor west
1535989 at significant cost to the principles and ideas that free nations prize putin has performed an extraordinary feat of leadership in imposing stability on a nation that has rarely known it and brought russia back to the table of world power for that reason vladimir putin is times 2007 person of the year
1535990 why did mr kasprov speak out in english rather than russian the whole thing was directed toward other countries rather than the russian people
1535991 sometimes we get the impression that america does not need friends
1535992 i dont believe these are misconceptions i think this is a purposeful attempt by some to create an image of russia based on which one could influence our internal and foreign policies this is the reason why everybody is made to believe russians are a little bit savage still or they just climbed down from the trees you know and probably need to have the dirt washed out of their beards and hair
1535993 on two occasions we felt let down when rahul dravid didnt get khel ratna and yuvraj singh was denied arjuna dravid was in good form we had won 16 odis on the trot and the team was on a high but he did not get the award
1535994 yuvraj too was unlucky not to get arjuna after two years of consistent performances we are happy dhoni got it
1535995 what i like most about mahi apart from his cricket is the way he leads he is a cool customer and never gets agitated im also impressed by his clarity of thought he speaks his mind even if it may not be seen in the right sense
1535996 we are very happy he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the icc world twenty20 and the tri series in australia mark him out as the ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
1535997 more and more of our debt is held by foreign countries some of which are our allies and some are not
1535998 anybody who looks at that list will see that some of the countries there are not traditional us allies you will see that china korea and a number of opec nations are there not all the countries on the list share the same economic national and foreign polices as the us
1535999 the us has a symbiotic relationship with china the us cannot afford for china to sell its us treasuries but equally china cannot afford to see the value of its treasury bonds slide they are strategic enemies and are in a financially weird relationship chinas holdings represent about a third of chinese gdp

1536001 there could be all kinds of reasons that might make people behave in certain ways that have nothing to do with terrorism if you have heightened security and there are a lot of police around it could be possible that you can feel and look guilty even when you havent done anything wrong
1536002 we need to reduce the motivation for people doing these kinds of things we shouldnt just accept that terrorism will remain as it is or worsen over the next 20 or 30 years and then just put all the technological solutions in place technology is certainly important in the fight against terrorism but that shouldnt detract from the crucially important challenge of finding out what is driving terrorism we need to have a sensible and honest appraisal as to what is radicalising young people
1536003 its just like something from minority report they have been watching too many tom cruise movies

1536007 this is a crucial issue for archaeology because if chickens were in south america before the spanish arrived it means people must have brought them there across the breadth of the pacific ocean
1536008 however to date there has been no conclusive archaeological evidence for the presence of polynesians in south america making recent claims for presence of pre columbian chickens in south america a key issue
1536009 the study found no support for previous claims for a polynesian introduction of chickens to south america

1536023 the dialectic of this offensive consists of a calculated shift from the old discredited soviet practice to a new liberalized model with a social democratic fa ade to realize the communist planners strategy for establishing a united europe at the beginning they introduced a variation of the 1968 czechoslovakian democratization at a later phase they will shift to a variation of the czechoslovakian takeover of 1948

1536036 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1536037 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1536038 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1536039 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security

1536055 whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him
1536056 well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1536057 what i like about kevin is hes got a view
1536058 thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket
1536059 hes positive and hes prepared to work extremely hard to get what he wants from the game
1536060 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1536061 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold

1536066 but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1536067 weve got to keep some perspective here this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that at the same time dont lose your mind youve got tornado sirens going off and severe weather all over the place theres no reason for it theres no reason to put fans at risk theres no reason for the players to be at risk

1536079 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1536080 brett is a traitor he wants to go play elsewhere

1536091 the women are still caught in fairytale narratives the right couple were signalled in the first episode when carrie and big met and in some ways the entire show has just been about them getting together
1536092 thats it miranda you dont need him go back to your friends
1536093 it seems churlish to be bitter about the fact that carrie et al do not offer a fail safe model for emancipated womanhood when nor frankly has real life feminism
1536094 ive heard that women living in nature tend to have their periods around the full moon is that true
1536095 yes it is common knowledge just about all the women in camp are having their periods at circle time
1536096 the good news is they rarely last over three days and while uncomfortable they are not debilitating
1536097 no one really noticed or suspected that the five people were heading toward the village until they were about half way there which was about one hundred miles out its not uncommon to be that far from the gathering spot
1536098 but it is a bit unusual for five people in a group to be headed that way
1536099 the other medics were speculating about it over the radio and while all the medics knew about the village no one had ever been there or known of anyone to go there no one even guessed that was where they were heading the next day a message came down to the medics that the village was a forbidden area and the medics needed to prevent the party from reaching it
1536100 i pretended ignorance and let some of the other medics deal with it
1536101 i kept away from the area and patrolled down by the lake like i normally do
1536102 when i came back the other medics were in an uproar it seemed the leader of the group crow had grown up in the village and knew all the people that lived there he was a citizen of the village and had every right to be there and to bring friends there if he chose one of the medics did a hasty check of his medical records and they did indeed prove he had grown up in the village and had a right to go there not knowing what else to do and fearing a mass confrontation the medics had allowed the group to continue on toward the village
1536103 back at the base the medics really got in trouble for refusing to follow orders and an immediate search went out to locate the group and subdue them by force if needed i went along with them
1536104 to make sure i would be a witness to anything that happened by then it was nightfall and we arrived at the groups camp only to find ten villagers there that had come out to meet crow and his group somehow they had known crow was coming we were taken by surprise because none of the villages wore med alert bracelets so we were not expecting them
1536105 the leader of the villagers was howling wolf crows grandfather when we insisted that crow and the others return with us by force if necessary howling wolf and his followers made it plain that crows group were honored guests in the village and that he would take personal responsibility for their safety he also said that he and his men would fight to protect them if needed
1536106 none of us were prepared for that kind of confrontation and we were forced to return back to base without them when i was bringing my air sled back i noticed a formation of around fifty black uniformed soldiers with weapons standing near an air transport at the landing strip i stayed to watch and after a half hour the soldiers went back inside the mountain and the air transport left without them
1536107 i believe the soldiers were going to attack the village on the pretext of bringing the group back it was only the involvement of so many of us medics that prevented the attack from happening
1536108 right now we are monitoring the group and everyone is fine i do hope someone comes back soon to prove they are not prisoners there if no one comes back this month i will go there myself even though it is against orders
1536109 our current orders are to monitor the five clansmen but to stay away from the village itself it is a tense situation at the base and we are all under severe reprimand for failing to carry out orders
1536110 this is causing resentment and revolt among us because we are supposed to be self governing with our circle of elders we dont take orders from anyone else the council of elders is not used to being told what it must do and what it must not do whoever was giving those orders gave them directly through our air sled terminals and the council of elders didnt know about it until it was too late
1536111 the council of elders started asking questions and it was then that i as a member of the circle of elders came forward i told the rest of the elders what i had learned about tobals father and mother being responsible for the sanctuary program and also about the former military involvement i told about the deaths of ron and rachel kane and the massacre at the gathering spot with the mass grave

1536278 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes

1536308 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1536309 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1536310 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1536311 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1536312 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1536313 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices

1536317 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too

1536321 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1536322 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1536323 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1536324 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1536325 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1536326 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important presidential election campaigns in years
1536327 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1536328 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1536329 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1536332 we use farmland birds because they are the focus of biodiversity conservation and an index of the populations of farmland birds is one of the 15 headline indicators of sustainable development in the uk
1536333 each species has a set of requirements it needs from the environment
1536334 for birds this can be broken down as needing somewhere to nest somewhere to feed and food availability
1536335 our framework assumes that agricultural change will impact on the birds if any of the changes affect the quality or quantity of the birds ecological requirements
1536336 species that feed on a wider range of prey and live in a greater number of habitats will be less vulnerable to the impact of agricultural change than species that have specialist requirements
1536337 research shows that two thirds of the species in our list have ecological requirements that make them susceptible to the possible impacts associated with the introduction of gm crops
1536338 but if those crops are introduced into the current uk farming landscape only one species is likely to be reclassified to a less favourable conservation status
1536339 our research identified a disparity between the source of population decline and the focus of mitigation measures under the els
1536340 our validation process shows that degradation within cropped habitat is the key driver for population decline but els uptake data shows that the focus of current plans is on field margin and hedgerow management
1536341 unless greater emphasis is placed on improving the value of cropped area habitat to biodiversity progress towards reversing declines in farmland birds and meeting the governments target is unlikely
1536342 the ultimate fighting championship ufc has been informed by the texas court of appeals that it has granted zuffas motion to compel randy couture to arbitrate in the district of nevada thereby staying all further action by hdnet against zuffa in the state of texas specifically the court of appeals found that the lower court had engaged in a clear abuse of discretion by permitting hdnet to litigate claims relating to mr coutures contract in texas rather than in nevada where zuffa is presently pressing a breach of contract action against mr couture

1536363 i offer an illustration provided to me by a gentleman who is in this audience tonight and who witnessed the following it was the mid 1940s during the second world war and a bunch of good ol boys too old for military service were sitting around in a general store in scotland county north carolina waiting for a representative of a cattlemans association
1536364 seems to me this whole wars on account of one man adolph hitler stead a sending all these supply ships to england and whatnot and gettingm sunk out in the atlantic ocean by u boats why dont we just go overe and shoot him
1536365 just go to where he lives and shoot the sonofabitch
1536366 i speck it aint that easy hes probably got a wall around his house
1536367 maybe he does but you git me a boat to git me overe and ill do it myself
1536368 ill waitil its night time see and then ill go around to the back of the house and climb the wall and hide behind a tree ill stay there all night and then in the morning when he comes out in the yard to pee ill shoot him
1536369 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1536370 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
1536371 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1536372 all she wanna do is bang bang bang and ka ching take your money
1536373 all of a sudden some more negative reviews got posted but there were no favorable or positive reviews
1536374 when we see that kind of suspicious activity taking place we will move quickly to take action against it
1536375 it sends clear message that shareholders are unhappy with current course
1536376 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1536377 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1536378 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1536379 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1536380 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1536381 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1536382 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1536383 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1536384 theres no federal labor provisions that requires they receive any minimum payment
1536385 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1536386 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1536387 i proposed a plan to build 45 new nuclear plants before the year 2030 and that would provide 700 000 jobs for american workers
1536388 the 40 or so power plants are consistent with some of our analysis and what would be required to the next 20 to 30 years to provide electricity at a reasonable cost
1536389 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to reprocessing i could not disagree more
1536390 my experience with nuclear power goes back many years to being stationed on the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier the uss enterprise
1536391 i knew it was safe then and i know its safe now

1536414 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season
1536415 i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1536416 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one
1536417 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1536418 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected
1536419 but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well
1536420 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1536421 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1536422 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1536423 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1536424 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1536425 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1536426 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1536427 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1536428 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a
1536429 the greens are over the top theyre straight from putt putt minus the swinging logs and clowns mouths
1536430 i am glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
1536431 most of the drama is a bunch of hooey hype hullabaloo drummed up to generate more interest in the film lexi alexander is still the director and the cut will be locked in a couple weeks
1536432 since my monkeys made so much news i decided to replace them with something a bit more interesting to talk about now if i would have real balls a picture of me mooning the vicious cyber world would follow but unfortunately i havent had time to workout so it wouldnt be a pretty sight yes my formerly cute ass has been planted on a chair in front of my computer to adapt the brit book that deborah del prete producer of the spirit mentioned at comicon hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

1536441 given the brutal commodity and consumer environment our second quarter comps were very encouraging and our earnings and cash flow yield remained strong
1536442 as the commodities market and operating environment remain both difficult and unpredictable we will continue to look for ways to assist both our corporate and franchise operators through this difficult period while driving top line sales
1536443 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road
1536444 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
1536445 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
1536446 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
1536447 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
1536448 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
1536449 weve seen an unprecedented number of headhunters recruiting for positions on the buy and sell sides
1536450 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
1536451 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
1536452 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
1536453 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
1536454 lotteries have infrastructure characteristics in that they have stable cash flows and high barriers to entry
1536455 they could even attract private equity investment because they are self financeable and require minimal capital expenses
1536456 lower and more predictable landing fees and terminal rentals for airlines which certainly arent flush
1536457 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1536458 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do
1536459 after gaining unprecedented access during his 14 trips to north korea and conducting 200 interviews in washington seoul tokyo and other asian capitals
1536460 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
1536461 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
1536462 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
1536463 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
1536464 there is an irony here that the hardliners attempt to pressure the north koreans to give up the bomb in fact created circumstances where the north became a nuclear power and made the whole process of undoing their nuclear program much much harder than had they adopted a similar approach at the beginning
1536465 june was the second straight month with more than a quarter million properties nationwide receiving foreclosure filings
1536466 foreclosure activity slipped 3 percent lower from the previous month but the year over year increase of more than 50 percent indicates we have not yet reached the top of this foreclosure cycle bank repossessions or reos continue to increase at a much faster pace than default notices or auction notices reos in june were up 171 percent from a year ago while default notices were up 38 percent and auction notices were up 22 percent over the same time period
1536467 from our investigations the employer didnt breach any labor laws
1536468 it has been a policy in this country for quite a number of employers to keep the passports for safety reasons
1536469 we view this seriously unless and until we maintain an appearance that we are a conducive place to do such business our conditions of work and employment are meeting up to international standards then we might lose out in the long run
1536470 the government will do everything to ensure that we are internationally competitive
1536471 re picis i read your column with regularity and i also see that picis is a platinum sponsor after their acquisition of lynx you would think they have one of the best ed products on the market so why then do i hear that layoffs are imminent at this company my source tells me they have had a mandatory non client related travel ban for over a year as well as a hiring freeze he says that while all of these bans are in place they continue to hire senior vp of this and senior vp of that sounds like a case of too many chiefs and not enough indians your thoughts
1536472 we believe picis does have the best edis on the market in particular the most complete integration between clinical and financial functionality for the ed according to millennium research december 2007 report we hold 1 market share which we view as validation of our vision and ability to deliver as for the other comments we do not discuss internal financial policies but will always manage the business as efficiently and effectively as possible we have hired 100 employees this year at all levels and we continue our hiring in areas of focused investment
1536473 re mashups become rias tpd has posted about mashups in the past and now those mashups are getting more robust by becoming rich internet applications rias even bill gates has been commenting on how they will evolve in the web operating system webos to enhance the information presented with the diverse number of silos in healthcare the ria experience would be a good way to unlock those isolated stores of patient data in radiology cardiology pathology and other applications the extensible markup language xml will play a key part in migrating these data stores to the webos
1536474 re uhg was at the healthcare quality conference yesterday in boston got to talking to a united health exec who informed me that they have signed an agreement with google health and have a pending agreement with healthvault this backs up uhgs previous statement that member records would be made portable individual made mention that the google health relationship extends beyond just claims records transfer and includes a technology partnership regarding uhgs omx
1536475 re tpds comments on kensho actually the ovf standard didnt come out of kensho its a formal standard adopted by the distributed management taskforce and was developed by dell hp ibm microsoft vmware and xensource now citrix the standard is still a work in progress the ovf standard only addresses the packaging of a virtual machine image and doesnt address management of virtual environments there are two important standards that address management of virtualization libvirt and cim historically virtualization vendors have been reluctant to adopt open management standards that break the bond between the hypervisor and management platform since it removes the vendor lock in in many cases vendors such as citrix and vmware have created their own apis xenapi and vmware api rather than adopt standards that would allow cross hypervisor management libvirt and cim dmtfs system virtualization partitioning and clustering schema are two open standards that hold the promise of allowing hypervisor agnostic management today ibm hp red hat sun novell futjitsu hitachi and many other isvs and oems are contributing to the project while kensho has been announced the only details available are in the form of press releases and blogs from citrix were looking forward to seeing the project or product in september
1536476 re sonitor on july 15th sonitor technologies laid off 40 of its worldwide staff including four people in the us largo headquarters the us staff is now down to three people it makes you wonder how they will support their newly announced contract with 3m is a deal with 3m bigger than we think
1536477 re no pizza for you cerner any readers know if the head honcho at isoft likes pizza
1536478 re recruitment here is how some hit companies do recruitment from a contingent recruiter to a potential candidate eclipsys let me know yesterday that there is going to be a 2 week delay in moving forward on this vp position a member of the eclipsys board of directors referred a candidate who is being strongly considered for the vp of ambulatory and ehealth solutions position i will keep you posted on the outcome of this interview process again i am sorry for the delay and thank you for your patience i guess it helps to have friends in high places
1536479 re cchit youve had a number of interesting items about cchit emrs lately here is another i had a long discussion with the head of engineering for a major cchit vendor his feeling is that cchit is holding back some innovation in the industry he said that well over 50 of his resources go into cchit ever year and some projects get pushed to the bottom of the list due to lack of those resources what you wind up with is a bunch of me too vendors that all have pretty much the same features with little differentiation between them
1536480 how can you expect to impact patient care and safety if you dont engage the entire team of providers using a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach current cpoe systems dont accomplish this they are designed for docs period i for one am weary of hearing that doctors lack of acceptance of computerized systems is the problem it is often said that doctors arent ready for systems or that it takes a cultural shift to get doctors to practice differently if online banking or shopping took me twice as long as running down to the local branch or grocer and at the end of the transaction i wasnt sure if it really went through correctly i would never become an adopter
1536481 q2 2008 operating cash flows were negative 300 000 down 6 1 million over the same quarter of last year we had negative free cash flows in the quarter of 10 7 million day sales outstanding were 80 days up six days sequentially and seven days year over year we believe this temporary increase is partly due to the transitioning of our billing function to india
1536482 criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the global to steal personal information from almost anywhere on the globe
1536483 obviously we werent happy that someone we had working for us as an informant was double dealing
1536484 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1536485 it is not difficult to imagine similar scenarios in the it branch or among engineers secretaries or nurses
1536486 in this era of individualization it was a huge mistake to create an organization of that size
1536487 it has become much more difficult to plan for labor battles
1536488 if each group of employees fights only for themselves solidarity plays less of a role and the socially weak are left behind

1536506 texas is about to execute mr medellin anyway taking the decision out of congress hands and placing the united states irrevocably in breach of the vienna convention on consular relations
1536507 t he decision to breach the treaty has effectively been made by the district attorney of harris county texas who with the approval of a state trial court judge set an execution date at the earliest point allowed under texas law
1536508 for a period of one year to allow congress an opportunity to enact implementing legislation
1536509 losses were affected by amortisation and while there was a small drop at the unwired level thats clearly not our interest thats part of the carry forward from the previous structure
1536510 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1536511 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1536512 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition
1536513 overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1536514 its disappointing that the focus has predominantly been on the retail side and not allowing for further analysis through the chain
1536515 the australian government today released a thorough analysis of the grocery market which dispels the myths and lays the facts on the table
1536516 our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab
1536517 this is a win win situation at a time when airlines around the world are retrenching employees to cope with the skyrocketing fuel price
1536518 although we want to reduce manpower in the short term to manage our cost as we are similarly affected by the fuel price our approach is different as we will grow in the medium to long term we want to keep our skilled employees
1536519 i think there is a parallel between san jose and detroit
1536520 it took the red wings three years of playoff experience to finally win the stanley cup as a team we had gained experience from losing to edmonton in 2006 and anaheim in 2007
1536521 i think there are three types of teams in the nhl
1536522 there are teams building for the playoffs teams expecting to make the playoffs and teams expecting to win the stanley cup san jose is like detroit in the latter group
1536523 our team is renowned for its in depth knowledge of global tech sector linkages the pcs research alerts will provide a snapshot of this in depth knowledge to help educate the press on the latest technology developments and help them better inform their readers about todays fast paced technology industry
1536524 if theres one message ive tried to say and send its that we have to go in the same direction
1536525 organizations responsible for defending workers socio economic and occupational interests should be able to use strike action to support their position in the search for solutions to problems posed by major social and economic policy trends which have a direct impact on their members and on workers in general in particular as regards employment social protection and standards of living
1536526 adoption of a general practice of investigation without detention of workers and bringing section 314 of the penal code obstruction of business in line with freedom of association principles
1536527 were quite a way into our next production cycle now
1536528 he does however gives his two cents about the future of multiplatform games with a set of tools
1536529 are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years
1536530 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1536531 this would presumably indicate that the foot belongs to a new missing person
1536532 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1536533 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1536534 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1536535 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sherrifs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1536536 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately
1536537 in the last couple of years weve had these tsunamis where thousands of people have died you cant help but think is it related to the tsunamis
1536538 ill be honest i like to come into new situations this is an expansion team its going to be built from scratch i have had experience doing that in the past in putting together a good product on the field so you know were real excited about that and just this market i think is a great market for football they obviously didnt have it last year i think theres kind of a fever out there to get it back i know theres been a lot of fan interest and i think the fan support will pick back up once we put that winning product out there on our way to the championship
1536539 right thats one of the things that we looked at and we had taken a whole year waited to put a team here weve talked with these guys for quite a while you know waited waited waited you know till we felt would be the right time we figured a year off would kind of let the market cool a little bit and then wed come back and give it a shot
1536540 the daily mail is essentially the uk equivalent of fox news and michelle malkin it features numerous pieces complaining about immigration foreigners europe how everything is hopelessly awful etc
1536541 damm we were all ready to throw a party and guest of honor neglected to appear
1536542 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
1536543 fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the imprimatur of acceptability by the television industry
1536544 the parents television council wont be satisfied with television content until they convince the government to enforce their personal selective judgments
1536545 we need to get an exact sense of the decision

1536559 as the boundaries between the liberal arts and social sciences are increasingly blurred in multidisciplinary solutions for which humanities and social science input is vital
1536560 is an endorsement of the program she says crcs are money well spent and i could not agree with her more
1536561 one positive outcome of the focus on end users identifying risks and challenges that require research is the prospect of greater demand side capabilities in industry government and community sectors
1536562 that crcs should be positioned in the pre competitive pre applicative space rather than the current emphasis on exploitation commercialisation of research outcomes

1536592 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1536593 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1536619 there is also a need to get rid aneco out of too much politicking and make elections for board of directors of the electric cooperative more transparent clean and make the board truly represent the sentiments of all consumers not of only vested interest elite few
1536620 it is sad that every election for aneco board of directors allegations that it is not being publicly announced resulting to only interest few attending it eventually are the ones elected through backed up of politicians cropped up every election day

1536622 mr trump sees it as a business and no more than that he understands that and theres nothing personal to it at all and thats what the ufc has problem with the ufc takes the work they do very very personal and in any business once you let your personal feelings get involved with it everything goes to crap mr trump is a strict businessman who respects the fighters this is going to be one of the biggest losses the ufc has ever had to date and one of the worst mistakes theyve ever made
1536623 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1536624 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1536625 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1536626 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story

1536632 todays prime time television programming is not merely indifferent to the institution of marriage and the stabilizing role it plays in our society
1536633 it seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
1536634 things that would not have been acceptable five or 10 years ago in our society are considered just part of the ongoing culture today

1536640 were looking at an eight to nine year time frame
1536641 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1536642 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1536643 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1536644 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1536645 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing
1536646 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1536647 is going to make a lot of american families very angry
1536648 the record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for iraq but the iraqi government isnt spending the money on rebuilding
1536649 if there is a significant increase a major nuclear renaissance with a large number of new plants a second repository may be needed
1536650 but you have to say compared to what the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1536651 all youre doing is pushing the whole problem out into the future and significantly increasing the cost
1536652 when you pull all the color out of the environment and you make it too homogeneous across the game youre pulling away the players reward of feeling like theyve progressed because the area theyre in now looks like the area they were in 30 to 45 minutes ago

1536676 i think that christianity has two emphases one is a social emphasis to impart the values of the kingdom of god in society to relieve the sufferings of the poor to stand up for the oppressed to be a voice for those who have no voice the other emphasis is to bring people into a personal transforming relationship with christ where they feel the joy and the love of god in their lives that they manifest what the fifth chapter of galatians calls the fruit of the spirit fundamentalism has emphasized the latter mainline churches have emphasized the former we cannot neglect one for the other

1536681 what makes a man a man a friend of mine once wondered
1536682 itong kaguluhan sa aleosan and midsayap sila mismo ang may kagagawan nito mga local government diyan they are expressing their opposition they want to make it appear magkakagulo that incident in aleosan and midsayap was the handiwork of the local government it is expressing its opposition to the peace process and wants to make it appear that chaos will prevail if government and the milf reach a peace agreement
1536683 it was a scenario to make it appear the milf cannot be trusted
1536684 we urge the government to send a strong signal of its determination to protect the media by assigning additional resources to the task force in charge of investigating attacks on journalists
1536685 we call for an immediate investigation into this attempt on cuestas life which follows a pattern that journalists in the philippines know only too well
1536686 journalists in the philippines are frequently killed and assaulted with impunity all for doing their jobs in the past 10 years at least 25 journalists have been victims of premeditated murder in connection to their work
1536687 we call on the senate to stand up for the filipino people on the issue of jpepa
1536688 tread on dangerous waters as has been shown by precedents in the arena of international treaties
1536689 the faults and ills of jpepa cannot be fixed by side notes the threats on the environment on the lives and on the livelihood of the filipino people cannot be eliminated by a general statement that our so called trading partner will respect philippine laws
1536690 its a public document already kumalat na ang kopya nito na na initial an circulated na kumbaga its a public document already copies of the agreement have already been initialed circulated

1536692 gobyerno mismo gumagawa ng paraan sila oppose ng oppose government is working to find peace but they keep opposing it it is not their private property
1536693 kaya ng gobyerno ito di na kailangan ang milf honest to goodness naman ang agreement walang tinatago the government can do this the agreement is honest to goodness there is nothing to hide
1536694 hindi naman nangangahulugan just because meron tayong kung sakaling nagpirmahan ng memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain yan ang tunay na kasunduan just because there is an agreement on ancestral domain it does not mean we should start implementing it immediately
1536695 ang ancestral domain ay isa lang sa three major agenda items hindi natin masasabi na yan ay pwede nang ipatupad ancestral domain is just one of three major agenda items we cannot say it will be implemented immediately
1536696 kinakailangan paratingin natin sa kongreso kung may final peace agreement para may bagong batas that will effectively implement the entire agreement we have to send it to congress to craft a law to implement the final peace agreement
1536697 ang tro ang na restrain dito ang government hindi naman pupuwede i restrain ang milf ng supreme court revolutionary organization ang milf a tro restrains only the philippine government the supreme court cannot restrain the milf which is a revolutionary organization

1536700 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1536701 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1536849 not only did i have second thoughts but third and fourth and fifth and sixth thoughts
1536850 i dont mind telling you that when bruce mcnall approached me and asked what it would take to get wayne to l a i asked for the entire kings franchise and an option on jerry buss lakers
1536851 youve got to understand the psychology of whats happened in edmonton its like a death and people need time to recover from that death its like any emotional shock youve got to get over it
1536852 not only did i have second thoughts but third and fourth and fifth and sixth thoughts
1536853 im concerned with today lets not wait for the future ive got to do something radical to sell hockey in l a and theres no name in hockey like wayne gretzky
1536854 ill always be the answer to the trivia question who was traded for wayne gretzky
1536855 gretzky going to los angeles is the best thing that can happen to hockey if you do well in los angeles all of the united states will start to watch you him being in los angeles is going to promote hockey
1536856 hey he belongs in l a hes the greatest im definitely going to go get season tickets even if they never win a game it will still be exciting to go now
1536857 its going to have an unbelievable impact here you have a franchise thats been struggling for over 21 years since 1967 with wayne gretzky going there it brings instant credibility respect and notoriety
1536858 gretzkys the best ambassador hockeys ever had this is a sensation happening for the nhl
1536859 i didnt know it would carry this type of magnitude
1536860 i remember that first summer i spent every day going to hockey clinics and doing interviews trying to sell the game it didnt happen overnight and a lot of people put in a lot of hours the one thing i worried about was being a 15 million bust
1536861 for me funny enough that year was my first all star game february 9 1988 in st louis and kings owner bruce mcnall had come to me and said i think i might have a shot at getting gretzky and ill never forget looking at him and thinking he was crazy and then after the all star game he never said a word and i didnt hear about it again for a long time i cant remember exactly when over the summer it was but i had seen bruce somewhere and he said were still working on that gretzky deal then the week before the trade i heard a lot of rumbling people were talking to me but i was still such a fan of wayne and a fan of the oilers that i just didnt believe it would ever happen to be honest until the day of the trade when bruce called me i was in montreal and told me he had made the deal for me wayne was the greatest player to play the game and i just didnt see him ever leaving edmonton
1536862 the first thing we knew right away was that we were going to be a contender we were going to be really good what people forget too is that when we got wayne we also got mike krushelnyski and marty mcsorley in the trade as well as john tonelli around the same time we got a lot of good players but wayne was involved in helping us become a good team fast suddenly we went from being a really young team to having all of these great veterans who had a lot of experience and who were winners and good people bruce mcnall made sure that wayne was surrounded well i think that was the smartest thing to do from our standpoint our team looked good right away every night we had kelly hrudey in net we werent sure we were going to win the stanley cup but we knew we had a good team
1536863 that day the way i tell people is hockey changed for years people said hockey could never work in los angeles and then there was so much success quickly we were selling the most jerseys in the nhl everything was just buzzing about our team and everywhere we went there was an event the next year 1989 90 bruce started setting us up with pre season games and we were literally doing tours i remember in 1989 that we started training camp in hull and playing one game in quebec and then suddenly we were going on a tour we played in every possible new market we were playing in miami tampa bay phoenix houston dallas cincinnati and cleveland instead of playing just a normal pre season we would do all of these tours and a lot of the games were either against the rangers or the penguins when i look back that is the reason why all of those teams are there today it was the impact of wayne gretzky on the sun belt suddenly people started to believe that hockey could exist with wayne gretzky we sold out arenas we had a pre season game in tampa bay in september 1990 with the largest crowd in hockey ever at the time 25 581 in the baseball stadium

1536996 when i looked at my schedule i saw there was a beauty pageant and i was trying to convince cindy to sign up
1536997 i think that its sad that bnt is going down i really liked working for the company they had a bunch of great employees it was very hard to work for bnt when intlibber was making his own black pr like the linden scanner that is one of the main reasons i quit however intlibber has started a whole new campign against himself by accusing his own landholders of being illicit alternate accounts of myself that i am using to destroy the sims
1536998 i have land on the estate and he banned me for being there because he unilaterally assumed i was an alt of jim even though every one of his employees would have been able to tell him otherwise
1536999 morally yes financially likely judging by his recent actions especially the whole linden scanner concept which he himself admitted is not about real help but to drive land prices up grid wide so he doesnt have to try so hard to compete how immoral a businessman do you have to be
1537000 then there is no way apple can get over its current spate of problems

1537002 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
1537003 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
1537004 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
1537005 flouting the world court ruling would be yet another blight on americas already tarnished international reputation

1537013 thats why teens tend to exhibit risk taking when you make the level super physiologic theres a wide range but in general theres an increase in aggressiveness
1537014 if he was on and off the substances that would be the worst possibly scenario for contributing to aggressive and irrational behavior
1537015 there are people who commit very violent acts because of broken marriages after losing their jobs where steroids arent involved at all
1537016 had severe emotional issues and could have had a tipping point event

1537018 we all have the tendency to behave irrationally and seek vengeance for things that are done to us but most of us are able to restrain our emotions when we think about the consequences

1537025 if you want to make a million dollars in art
1537026 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1537027 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1537028 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
1537029 the technology was designed around the behavior of a conventional engine using an existing engine sound which makes it instantly recognisable with the pitch and frequency helping to identify vehicle distance and speed
1537030 each time the driver steps on the accelerator a counter push back control mechanism is activated if the system detects excess pressure helping to inform the driver that they could be using more fuel than required
1537031 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1537032 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1537033 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1537038 could be the basis for potential charges against individuals or the state
1537039 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes hutu militia
1537040 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1537041 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1537042 it affects the best surfing in the world in that area
1537043 i think its still notable that most of the signatories represent areas that are far away from the proposed 241 the majority of local officials support the 241 and recognize the growing problem of gridlock on i 5

1537051 one company controls 95 of the gm seeds sold anywhere in the world monsanto
1537052 so while the prices of food have gone up 50 the profits of these corporations have literally gone up 100 five giant seed companies five giant grain trading companies we are talking about control that humanity has never experienced in its history
1537053 italy had a mussolini germany had a hitler the world has now the ten giant corporations controlling our food system creating a food fascism food fascism means an end to food just like fascism in europe meant an end to freedom
1537054 the polish public has showed wisdom and caution towards things we arent prepared for and know little about
1537055 we dont have a policy one way or another but we produce crops that can give us the corn flakes we desire
1537056 the patenting of gm seeds which prohibits saving of the seeds by farmers who plant them in normal circumstances but particularly in the current food crisis is disturbing as our food production system is increasingly being placed in the hands of gm seed companies thus undermining not only household food security but also food sovereignty
1537057 farming is a hugely risky business the input costs can be anywhere between r5000 to r7000 a hectare if youre spending that much you have to get a good yield the major beneficiaries here are the farmers
1537058 we strongly believe that the department of agriculture is guilty of negligence for causing serious gmo contamination of the thai papaya species
1537059 the doas acquittal despite its failure to submit comprehensive data on the steps taken to contain gmo contamination from field trials held five years ago clearly indicated the general lack of access of government authorities to information about both experimental and commercially available genetically engineered crops gmo polluters must pay for the damage they wreak on farmers on our food and the environment otherwise we are risking the very sovereignty of our food crops
1537060 the fact that the doa was forced to carry out efforts to decontaminate fields of gmo papaya already proves that the agency committed an infraction after it deliberately distributed gmo papaya seeds to local farmers despite a ban on open trials and releases we believe that the responsible parties should be held liable for an act that continues to pose serious hazards to thai agriculture
1537061 gmo contamination of organic feeds could threaten consumers safety as well as my dairys organic certification
1537062 i started this program in order to safeguard my livelihood as an organic farmer

1537076 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
1537077 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
1537078 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes
1537079 it also may help add some scientific weight to the argument that eating broccoli is good for you

1537099 unlike egypt where there are other attractions for tourists like the pyramids and artefacts
1537100 dubai has no choice but to focus its attention on building extraordinary hotels which will have tourists travelling here just to see them
1537101 and making sure that we have a variety of unique hotels with interesting concepts will further boost tourism business
1537102 in order for dubai to attract tourists from the gcc and asian markets our studies show that the novelty factor plays a very important role in luring them in
1537103 so thats why its very important to kept the wow factor alive
1537104 one of the reasons i decided to visit dubai is to see this ski slope inside a mall the idea was very new to me and i also thought it was practical to ski and then shop
1537105 like the burj al arab hotel this is another icon for dubai
1537106 we are planning to become one of the landmarks in the emirate that people from all over the world would come to see
1537107 we never planned to have one its not a major part of our business
1537108 our market research really came from our presence in dubai at the royal mirage from that we had a pretty good idea about what the market here demands
1537109 the hotel will have an asian theme which means there will be asian shops a floating market like the one in thailand and a great wall of china roller coaster ride
1537110 a year ago the investment figure for the project was dh100bn and we have now doubled it because we want this project to stand out from any other
1537111 the hotel will also be divided into a five star and four star section so we can reach both segments of the market
1537112 with a project on such a large scale the returns will not come instantly
1537113 by targeting people from the gcc north africa and asia the project will be successful because we are providing them with all the fun family holiday activities in one convenient well planned area

1537129 she had a dark look but i dont think she had dark brown eyes i think they were green brown what caught my attention was the fact that she showed little or no emotion
1537130 then the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is i answered that her mother was a little bit further back in the shop and she answered she is not my mummy
1537131 i asked her who the woman was and she said she is a stranger she took me from my mummy

1537153 it is a misconception that anyone who is qualified as a lawyer can properly represent victims in a personal injury case most people would not consider being professionally seen by a neurologist for a heart problem
1537154 even if you do they will refer you to a proper professional the same is true for attorneys a good attorney should be able to look at the merits of your case properly assess what you are monetarily entitled to and the best strategy to pursue your case
1537155 your personal injury attorney should be experienced with dealing with insurance companies insurance companies will naturally try to pay the lowest amount they can get away with
1537156 the good news is most attorneys charge the same amount of fees this means you can look around for the best personal injury lawyer you can find and you will end up being provided with a larger settlement than you would have otherwise received
1537157 remember to choose carefully consultations with personal injury accident lawyers are typically free of charge and usually there is no fee until after your case is won or settled out of court

1537178 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way

1537220 lindsey came to this neighborhood armed with a deadly weapon and a despicable lack of regard for the consequences of his actions
1537221 he was just riding around it wasnt like he was hiding it
1537222 this could have been avoided if the police had done their job
1537223 la verdad es una mentira en los ojos de quien la mira

1537249 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1537250 people believe we are a free place and thats just not true
1537251 people should have to pay for prescriptions just not too much
1537252 that 25 prescription can end up costing the hospital 4 000 if it was for something like an antibiotic that was unfilled
1537253 we really wanted to build on afrifest but it was important for us that we keep it community based and non profit
1537254 we have the freedom to deal with our aesthetic and philosophical goals when you take money out of it
1537255 the twin cities are in a really interesting position globally to show how you do this right

1537260 criminalize providing humanitarian aid to persons without first checking their legal status
1537261 usually all we know is that someone is here but we dont know what brought them here we need to pay more attention to their stories
1537262 we need to be mindful in terms of taking care of all people including those residents who arent citizens
1537263 a lot of our work is about connecting anglo catholics building solidarity
1537264 some people dont agree that the church should even be involved in social justice advocacy
1537265 i want to stand up for those who have no place no voice wealth or language skills because thats where i come from
1537266 we are ruled by a dictator who wants to cheat the u s and europe by saying he is trying to democratize the country
1537267 but he is not trying to democratize at all he is suppressing the nation brutally and he is suppressing difference of opinion if you want to say something against him somehow you will be silenced
1537268 if these people do not help us who else will help us first by providing leadership and secondly with financial help i come and other politicians come to allow people here to see problems developing in their country to see if they accept our proposals and to listen to their suggestions and proposals
1537269 the oromo people are the most evicted the most displaced the most repressed and the most occupied people in ethiopia
1537270 you are the advocate of an occupier you are aiding this belligerent power i ask you are you defending the occupiers or standing with the oromo people
1537271 this is the same propaganda that has held us back and kept us down for so many years you cannot say that i am a friend of the government they think i am an enemy they want to kill me
1537272 if you do another force will take power from you and it will go on endlessly like that
1537273 demeksa has good ideas but no way to get to his goal
1537274 he calls for peaceful demonstrations but there are no such things in ethiopia
1537275 martin luther king needed malcolm x to pave his way
1537276 i agree with that we have reached the point where we need change in ethiopia by any means necessary
1537277 our latest album was the last thing we had to deliver for ferret so we are in limbo we are talking to some labels right now i think people will be very pleased to know that it looks like we will not be signing with a major some were interested but i dont think we even got down to discussing deals i know i would have signed a shakira esque 100 million dollar 360 deal but it never seemed to come up in conversation
1537278 the cd you would compile if asked to make a mix of the best
1537279 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers

1537292 it is especially critical that the aals acknowledge that there is no issue of discrimination here there is no evidence that the hotel in question discriminates against gays instead this is viewpoint discrimination on the part of a handful of activists who are seeking to hijack the aals for purposes of holding a boycott intended to punish someone with whose views on a contested issue of public policy they differ one can only imagine how the sponsors of the boycott would react if i and other like minded faculty insisted that the aals boycott a hotel chain that supported abortion by say donating money to naral

1537296 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1537297 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1537298 we are appealing it because i think that is too much for me
1537299 im disappointed because im hurt i got left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1537300 my ballclub is going through a pretty tough time right now and i got to be with them 100 per cent i let my club down for two days
1537301 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1537302 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1537303 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1537304 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1537305 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it

1537327 then one day a member of the group was coming in for a landing he let his airspeed fall too low before he extended his flaps and the ship stalled out and he crashed and was burned beyond recognition and they brought out the bridge coats and sang about those in peril in the air and put the bridge coats away and the men shook their heads and said it was a damned shame but he should have known better than to wait so long before lowering the flaps
1537328 american companies hold a lot of leases that they havent drilled on 65 million acres of leased inactive federal land could produce an additional 4 8 million barrels of oil
1537329 that would double u s oil production let me make it clear this is what theyre sitting on
1537330 with all the people around youre never sure what the outcome is going to be

1537340 the mayor seems like the kind of person you could just have a conversation with
1537341 all the things shes taught me ive been implementing we sort of bounce ideas off each other
1537342 ladan has an idea and then she finds out how we can do it
1537343 shes created so many different partnerships when you have leaders like that you really want to support them in being powerful with what they do
1537344 we see this as a model that could increase economic opportunities for people in developing countries
1537345 if you just know how to type that can be the difference between earning 1 an hour instead of 1 a day
1537346 the aim of the review is to make the system simpler and to make it more efficient but im not going to buy into the means by which we do that
1537347 it will not be my task in this process as we go through it to rule some things in and to be ruling things out
1537348 i make no apology none whatsoever for saying that we will not be moved on the base or the rate of gst
1537349 that was a committment that we made to the people at the last election and we are not moving on that
1537350 no doubt some people will find some of the observations a little uncomfortable
1537351 i dont want to point to any particular ones to do so would be in itself to make comment on the quality of other peoples arguments and i dont want to choke off discusssion
1537352 the blake prize however embraces diversity in its entries and it is important to us that we remain open to the many styles through which artists engage with the subject area
1537353 the other two judges believe that the work submitted by cullen for the blake prize shows an engagement with the history and complex symbolism of the crucifixion and on the basis of their assessment we will include the work amongst the finalists
1537354 a bit cowardly we would have thought he would have at least had the courage to come and see the court and what was going on
1537355 then we can look to consider whether in the psychiatrists opinion the accused is fit to stand trial and whether we are proceeding at that point or whether there are fitness concerns that need to be canvassed by the court
1537356 credit and debit card information is just not incredibly secure
1537357 but it is counterbalanced by the amount of fraud losses due to cheque fraud and direct debit fraud which is much greater than credit card fraud
1537358 regardless of how strong the security measures and how vigilant the weak part of the chain is there is always a human who is responsible and who has overall control over the information
1537359 assume that there will be some sort of fraud on your account sooner or later
1537360 our information is a lot more secure after all the publicity we have had about attacks
1537361 but yes there are still problems that still exist though it is getting safer
1537362 if the proper encryption is configured on the wireless access point then an attacker will not be able to get any information i would have to bet in this case that didnt happen
1537363 if you are a victim of credit card fraud you might get your identity stolen and then you lose more than just money you lose time you lose trust and it could take years to fix your credit
1537364 if a cardholder is concerned at all about the security of their account they should immediately contact their issuing financial institution
1537365 it is not our job to go around checking who is compliant with this that is lead by the credit card brands
1537366 we have no choice but to trust the retailers are doing their bit but we can do more
1537367 since were authorized to sell all lots in this 3 day auction with no reserves and no minimum bids there will doubtless be a number of pieces that go at bargain prices while others will surprise you how they go
1537368 whether you are a serious collector or are looking for a new sporting firearm this auction will have something for everyone at prices that cant be beat with the shear quantity you simply will not find a better selection of quality and price
1537369 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country

1537371 he was a great man one of the few honest people of those times
1537372 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repressions
1537373 by his works and his entire life he innoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1537374 its primary purpose is to inform discussions and debates because frankly there has been a lot of rubbish about who can claim sovereignty over what
1537375 to be honest most of the other maps that i have seen in the media have been very simple
1537376 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1537377 all coastal states have rights over the resources up to 200 nautical miles from their coastline
1537378 so we used specialist geographical software to buffer the claims out accurately
1537379 energy security is driving interest as is the fact that arctic ice is melting more and more during the summer
1537380 we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1537381 we are clearly looking at a housing market which has deteriorated very considerably in recent months
1537382 we do think the economic climate and the housing market is going to be difficult for some considerable time
1537383 the future is going to be governed very considerably by what happens in the wider economy house prices in particular and what happens in terms of how house prices flow through to the loan book
1537384 we are a poor proxy for the industry we are different

1537388 the board continues to believe that the company has a very strong future as an independent group
1537389 the clear strategy of organically diversifying the groups activities and increasing exposure to growth markets together with the longer term structural growth drivers mean that the company has excellent prospects
1537390 adecco may believe that it had a once in a cycle opportunity to acquire michael page whilst a bid premium of up to 42 per cent may be attractive to some other investors may be unwilling to sell out at a depressed valuation when the shares were trading at 600p a year ago
1537391 the management of michael page are strongly independent and are unlikely to recommend a sale unless the offer is over 400p

1537395 i have found that emotional and patriotic sentiments are high in india when it comes to raising funds for the elusive olympic individual gold
1537396 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1537397 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1537398 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1537399 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale
1537400 golden brown session beer full bodied with an aroma of floral hops initial malty flavour fades as citrus and hops take over leading to a hoppy bitter finish
1537401 its one of the hardest beers to brew because there are fewer ingredients in it and weve managed to put a lot of flavour into a low alcohol beer and keep it consistent
1537402 the water that comes from the local north downs hills is perfect for brewing bitters
1537403 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1537404 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1537405 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1537406 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months
1537407 as for me and my house we will serve the lord
1537408 i was just saying that favre should have put the team before himself through this whole mess

1537414 i was told playing in green bay was not an option
1537415 its hard for me to trust this guy thompson when either im told one thing and everyone else is told another or hes telling the public one thing and telling me another

1537461 its been said in this town many times that the right has a debt to pay for the blacklisting of lefties in the 50s and that in all fairness its probably going to take a long time to make amends the fact is that the philosophical grandfathers and great grandfathers of todays right wingers ruined the lives of many hollywood screenwriters in the 50s and so their descendants now have to suffer and make up for that

1537464 creo que es bastante notable que incluso en medio de todo este alboroto la productividad laboral en ee uu haya seguido creciendo a un ritmo m s r pido del de casi todos los otros pa ses industrializados y muestra cu n fuerte es esta econom a

1537495 like most kids that grew up in the valley i had a strong interest in cruising when i got to college and actually studied a lot of anthropology i began to realize that was a uniquely american mating ritual involving automobiles i came up with the idea of doing the movie it was in the 60s it was you know the hippie culture drugs cruising was gone and i really felt compelled to sort of document the whole experience of cruising and what my generation used as a way of meeting girls and what we did in our spare time
1537496 im a jew from new york what do i know from modesto we didnt have cars we rode the subway or bicycles
1537497 its a musical montage theres no characters theres no story
1537498 american graffiti was unpleasant because of the fact that there was no money no time and i was compromising myself to death but i could rationalize it because of the fact that well it is just a 700 000 picture its roger corman and what do you expect you cant expect everything to be right for making a little cheesy low budget movie
1537499 it was really the first film to have wall to wall classic rock soundtrack something that has set a precedent and is fairly common today such that now you have a credit for somebody on films called music supervisor and thats their responsibility choosing the song well this position didnt exist at that time and george really created it and he did it himself so as he was writing the screenplay he had his sisters 45 rpm record player and this stack of rock n roll 45 rpm records from the late 1950s early 1960s
1537500 it had become depressing to go to the movies i decided it was time to make a movie where people felt better coming out of the theater than when they went in
1537501 the nostalgia boom has finally produced a lasting work of art lucas has brought the past alive with sympathy affection and thorough understanding at 28 he is already one of the worlds master directors
1537502 american graffiti is such a funny accurate movie so controlled and efficient in its narrative that it stands to be over praised to the point where seeing it will be an anticlimax
1537503 although american graffiti is highly regarded as an american classic it falls flat on a number of reasons firstly the film relies too heavily on fifties nostalgia and though this may have seemed a novelty in 1973 it has been severely worn out in 2001 dont forget that this film was made a year before happy days and the numerous other rehashes secondly because it relies so heavily on nostalgia the film puts less stock in a properly structured screenplay and american graffiti lacks a strong enough thread to pull the audience through the film
1537504 the most flippant place to start is with george lucas specifically what happened to the george lucas who made american graffiti for a film with the cinematographers listed in the end credits american graffiti is beautifully lighted i first saw the film when i was in my early teens and to this day all my memories of teenage late nights are in the films day for night lighting the street scenes are amazing the scene with the police car is fantastic but paul le mat and mackenzie phillipss entire ride is probably the best its all just so perfectly executed and only made better by the exceptional editing
1537505 hey if this guy sees me and still acts or thinks the way he does about me then i must be okay

1537509 gt says kevin de cock director of whos hiv aids department
1537510 in one place it captures whos best guidance on what the global hiv aids health sector response needs to deliver
1537511 it is not about choosing between health systems strengthening on the one hand and disease specific programmes on the other
1537512 it is about working together to generate added value the time has come to move from observing the intentional and unintentional impacts of health investments to actively managing better outcomes that can be sustained
1537513 gt unhcr is helping roma ashkaelia and egyptian refugees obtain legal documents and register their children at school
1537514 in addition to extreme poverty and generally low levels of education the lack of personal documents and or civil registration represents a serious obstacle to the integration of roma ashkaelia and egyptian refugees into mainstream montenegrin society
1537515 many of their children are denied school registration and they cant get proper jobs or full social services without proper documents roma ashkaelia and egyptian refugees are not recognized as persons before the law and are often in effect stateless this statelessness can be carried down to future generations
1537516 we hope that by assisting a large number of cases we will help bring about systemic changes and make it easier for others to carry out these tasks in the future without lawyers

1537521 as boomers age and their parents become invalid or pass away the added burden of having to deal with all that stuff left behind is compounded by the fact that their parents once hoarded items of value in order to stay alive and it ultimately became habitual
1537522 being able to sort through added stuff brought about by the depression era mentality is even more necessary
1537523 i have also seen even the tightest family relationships torn apart by feuds over the individual perceptions of value and fairness this is a problem that can be avoided when everyone understands and can make informed decisions regarding the real value of the items at hand
1537524 the boomer burden offers trustworthy council for one of lifes most overwhelming challenges the infirmity and death of a boomers parents grueling as that is they are then faced with the daunting task of dividing the estate contents and finally clearing out the family home totally unprepared for the battles ahead the boomer burden will lead the reader through heart wrenching and heartwarming scenarios that will truly touch their hearts it offers support and guidance during these times and was specifically written to instill hope and peace where there is little or none it will assist the reader from beginning to end what to do what not to do and how to do it all in the most appropriate manner taking a client from a place of confusion and worry and bringing them back to a place of peace and comfort is the goal of this book

1537544 energy prices are not going back to the good old days
1537545 at least once a month and before every road trip

1537551 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1537552 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1537553 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1537554 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1537555 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1537556 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1537557 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1537558 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1537559 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1537560 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1537561 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1537562 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1537579 it was assumed that petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1537580 with families wanting to cut their travel to reduce petrol costs tourist destinations further from metropolitan areas could suffer particularly in areas already struggling with the effects of drought
1537581 the decision by families to slash their spending by up to 500 and to holiday closer to home means an urgent campaign is needed to boost local tourism
1537582 almost 20 per cent of the tourist destinations the nrma surveyed said they would be forced to lay staff off and a further 55 per cent will have to cut back on operating costs

1537857 this is really a surprise because i didnt think it was going to be such a big deal
1537858 why we wore the masks is simple pollution when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry
1537859 they have pollution in los angeles and if the olympics were in los angeles we would probably wear these masks too
1537860 i am very pleased and honored to meet with his holiness the dalai lama a man of peace his holiness represents the profound desire of millions of tibetans for basic dignity and human rights
1537861 his nonviolence approach and his lifelong approach of seeking common ground around cultural and religious divides are an inspiration for all of mankind and to millions of americans
1537862 hes trying to draw a distinction between himself and the president whos going to the olympics

1537868 man is not a balloon going up into the sky nor a mole burrowing merely in the earth but rather a thing like a tree whose roots are fed from the earth while its highest branches seem to rise almost to the stars
1537869 seven years after anthrax laced letters terrorized an already frightened nation a new suspect suddenly emerged in the public eye this week but he was gone just as quickly committing suicide before he could be charged with murder and adding another dramatic twist to the bizarre episode the governments working theory that brilliant but troubled army scientist bruce e ivins released the anthrax to test his cure for the toxin answers some of the questions perhaps but many details remain unclear i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure said former senate democratic leader tom daschle of south dakota whose office received a letter containing the deadly white powder in 2001 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today ivins unexpected emergence as the top and perhaps only suspect in the anthrax attacks follows on the heels of the governments exoneration of another army scientist in the case last month the justice department cleared ivins colleague steven hatfill who had been wrongly suspected in the case and paid him 5 8 million
1537870 over the past week the media was gripped by the news that the fbi was about to charge bruce ivins a leading anthrax expert as the man responsible for the anthrax letter attacks in september october 2001 but despite the seemingly powerful narrative that ivins committed suicide because investigators were closing in this is still far from a shut case the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone i believe this is another mistake in the investigation
1537871 usamriid doesnt deal with powdered anthrax i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
1537872 i have been a close friend of dr bruce ivins for years the fbi needed a scapegoat especially after stephen hatfill whose foot the fbi ran over won a 5 2 m lawsuit against them
1537873 why should we worry about islamists commandeering airplanes when we have israelis commandeering our entire government

1537879 quick tell me what it was like before you forget
1537880 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1537881 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1537882 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1537883 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1537884 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing
1537885 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1537886 is going to make a lot of american families very angry
1537887 the record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for iraq but the iraqi government isnt spending the money on rebuilding
1537888 the dichotomy between what olympics visitors will see and what residents experience

1537890 political change however gradual and inconsistent has made china a significantly more open place for average people than it was a generation ago
1537891 the similarities between these two coming out parties are eye popping dissidents jailed social undesirables mainly poor migrant workers kicked out of town three rings of police checkpoints surrounding the city old buildings bulldozed security so overwhelming as to squeeze all the fun out of the party
1537892 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
1537893 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
1537894 we need perspective on this i was there during the cultural revolution and i watched people being carted away in the streets to be shot in the back of the neck about 3 million people died ive been back often since and each time there is a sort of incremental freedom though sometimes it moves backward

1537903 ya rasulullah sebenarnya hamba ini selalu sahaja berbuat dosa dan payah hendak meninggalkannya
1537904 berat juga aku hendak meninggalkan apa yang dikehendaki oleh rasulullah itu
1537905 berani engkau berbuat jahat apakah jawapan kamu nanti apabila ditanya oleh rasulullah sanggupkah engkau berbohong kepadanya
1537906 kalau aku berbohong kepada rasulullah bererti aku telah mengkhianati janjiku padanya sebaliknya jika aku bercakap benar bererti aku akan menerima hukuman sebagai orang islam oh tuhan sesungguhnya di dalam pesanan rasulullah itu terkandung sebuah hikmah yang sangat berharga

1537914 wahai anakku aku akan keluar untuk berperang dan kau tinggal di rumah menjaga wanita dan anak anak
1537915 wahai ayahku demi allah janganlah berbuat seperti itu kerana keinginanku untuk memerangi mereka lebih besar daripada keinginanmu engkau telah berkepentingan untuk tinggal di rumah maka izinkanlah aku keluar dan tinggallah engkau di sini wahai ayahku
1537916 allah mewajibkan aku berjihad dan rasulullah memanggilku untuk berangkat berperang sedangkan engkau meminta sesuatu yang lain padaku sehingga bagaimana engkau rela melihat aku taat padamu tetapi aku menentang allah dan rasulullah
1537917 wahai anakku apabila ada antara kita harus ada yang berangkat satu orang baik kau mahupun aku maka dahulukan aku untuk berangkat
1537918 demi allah wahai ayahku kalau bukan masalah syurga maka aku akan mendahulukanmu
1537919 engkau harus menemani kami di syurga dan aku telah menerima janji allah wahai rasulullah demi allah aku rindu untuk menemaninya di syurga usiaku telah lanjut dan aku ingin berjumpa dengan tuhanku

1537954 we believe that one of the worst things to happen is the american publics attention is turning elsewhere which is the worst thing that could possibly happen for the people of new orleans
1537955 what we hope is to give them the idea that they are being watched that they are being observed that they have the attention of the american people
1537956 i am the security officer whom len kiely sexually harassed
1537957 on being told the free government quota of alcohol had been reached mr kiely became upset and proceeded to sexually harass me and undermine my security position in a very loud and obnoxious way

1537960 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1537961 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1537962 we will always raise our human right concerns with them
1537963 ive done it in the past ive done it privately ive done it publicly ill be doing it at again
1537964 the international olympic committee has a responsibility to ensure we have a fair games and that means a proper and rigorous approach to testing so that everyone has a fair chance everyone has a fair go and that our athletes are on the same level playing field
1537965 surgical masks are designed to protect patients rather than the wearer
1537966 we presume it works the other way around to protect the wearer and thats not so at all
1537967 if youre wearing a mask and it doesnt fit well you might get an increased restriction to air flow it would be harder to breathe
1537968 it will not be my task in this process as we go through it to be ruling things in and to be ruling things out what we do want is a full frank and mature conversation with the australian people because we are serious about the long term modernisation of our tax and transfer payments system
1537969 the aim of the review is to make the system simpler and more efficient im not buying in or out about less or more
1537970 so much has changed in australia since the war globalisation the rise of new information technologies population ageing climate change all of these challenges demand a comprehensive review of our tax system
1537971 what this does is extend the timeframe that the planning authority has to make a final decision on the development application
1537972 the government had always indicated from the start of this process we have planning legislation in place to deal with just these sorts of issues and that we would stick with that planning process in spite of all of the pressure all of the political grandstanding
1537973 may be used toward the price of one ticket one fare on us airways us airways shuttle and us airways express as well as their codeshare partners
1537974 theres not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss that is what youd lose along the way
1537975 i think itd be a totally different story if we had a major centre like sydney in south australia
1537976 you can actually see down the bottom of the goolwa channel and so forth and working its way up the lake
1537977 you can actually see a signal of marine water thats already moved into the systems here were just fortunate that in the channels we dont get much wind activity so these dont mix into the water column
1537978 i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him
1537979 hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly
1537980 they all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ
1537981 many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord
1537982 he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
1537983 whove seen death beyond measure and whove fled to jesus because they know hes the only one who can make sense out of calvary to know the one who died there whos still alive
1537984 we had been eye witnesses of his exaltation such honor such glory was bestowed on him by god the father that a voice came to him out of splendour which dazzles human eyes this it said is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased we his companions on the holy mountain heard that voice coming from heaven and now the word of the prophets gives us more confidence than ever it is with good reason that you are paying so much attention to that word it will go on shining like a lamp in some darkened room until the dawn breaks and the day star rises in your hearts
1537985 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1537986 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1537987 we believe that the fed will be in a position to hold rates steady well into 2009
1537988 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1537989 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months
1537990 the law punishes teenage boys who tie up and abuse a stray cat so why allow industrialists to run factory farms that keep pigs almost all their lives in tiny pens that are barely bigger than they are
1537991 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1537992 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad
1537993 the recount somewhat lowers the credibility of the management team
1537994 assuming this was all a mistake it is particularly unfortunate management doesnt have the mandate they appeared to have had
1537995 upon review it was determined that there was a truncation error in the final printout sent to the tabulator
1537996 this resulted in the under reporting of shares withheld for certain directors
1537997 for the next several quarters there is going to be more noise especially with the stock below 20
1537998 as there are many companies setting up in this sector at this point in time how has this organization been able to successfully maintain its growth rate and continue to appoint new staff members
1537999 could you explain how this particular job has been executed in the past
1538000 what are the enhancements you would want to see take place to this the interviewer should inform you of the expertise involved in that job by giving you some particular examples then you must convince the interviewer that you have what the company is looking for giving you an advantage
1538001 this is a significant investment for nab and we plan to take a very phased and measured approach over the next five years
1538002 our existing it systems have served the business well to date however they are not sufficient to support our future strategic direction
1538003 has concentrated on exploring why a program that was initially popular and well regarded has declined in appeal to research providers and not attracted firms in sufficient numbers to generate innovation on a whole of industry basis
1538004 as the boundaries between the liberal arts and social sciences are increasingly blurred in multidisciplinary solutions for which humanities and social science input is vital
1538005 is an endorsement of the program she says crcs are money well spent and i could not agree with her more
1538006 one positive outcome of the focus on end users identifying risks and challenges that require research is the prospect of greater demand side capabilities in industry government and community sectors
1538007 that crcs should be positioned in the pre competitive pre applicative space rather than the current emphasis on exploitation commercialisation of research outcomes
1538008 australians are very good at getting on with the job and working together for the common good
1538009 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1538010 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1538011 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition
1538012 overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1538013 its disappointing that the focus has predominantly been on the retail side and not allowing for further analysis through the chain
1538014 the australian government today released a thorough analysis of the grocery market which dispels the myths and lays the facts on the table
1538015 our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab
1538016 chicora merged with queens college located in charlotte nc in 1915
1538017 it has been a tailors shop a cobblers shop a school and a gas station
1538018 the first location was augusta and church streets the land for furman university was purchased by vardry mcbee for 3 750
1538019 our goal is to promote live music in the west end
1538020 when festivals come people stop at the end of main street and they dont make it all the way down to the west end
1538021 were doing what we can to further drive people to the west end and remind people that were alive and well
1538022 well there must be no truth to issue x if the author had to distort things so much to make her case
1538023 well duh all religion is based in illogic and fantasy so why is anyone surprised these people are nutjobs
1538024 once someone sees mr heller walk in that door with his gun and start the registration process then walk back out with his gun it may be a different story
1538025 it appears that the city does not yet understand the decision and order of the supreme court
1538026 trying to find as many ways as they can to make the process as difficult and unattractive as they can
1538027 mayor fenty promised us he would follow the letter and spirit of the law he has done neither
1538028 mr fenty and the city council are not above the constitution of the united states
1538029 im hot and i have a plan that is more than those other guys
1538030 losses were affected by amortisation and while there was a small drop at the unwired level thats clearly not our interest thats part of the carry forward from the previous structure
1538031 criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the global to steal personal information from almost anywhere on the globe
1538032 obviously we werent happy that someone we had working for us as an informant was double dealing
1538033 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1538034 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1538035 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1538036 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1538037 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1538038 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1538039 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1538040 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1538041 were sitting on the fence waiting out the storm we are very patient developers and we want this project to sell out quickly right now the project is literally collecting dust i havent thought about it at all for the last four months

1538043 this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case that has ever been charged in this country
1538044 highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1538045 we have worked very closely with law enforcement authorities as they conducted an extensive international investigation into this complex crime
1538046 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1538047 this is an old breach its from 2004 so we are pleased that progress is being made on this
1538048 we fully cooperated with the u s attorneys office and will continue to do so if asked
1538049 they put a gun down by their feet and they didnt realize when the weapon is not there
1538050 why was an alleged terrorist put behind curtains and not behind bars
1538051 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1538052 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1538053 we undertook a world class research effort to discover why that might have happened
1538054 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget
1538055 and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because theres enough engineers and r amp d and technology that keeps us getting longer if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway its probably a good avenue
1538056 i have no problem with that because i feel like its a challenging thing for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of rough or out of the rough
1538057 is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out
1538058 as we change the grooves were going to have to start maybe looking at the way our golf ball is performing
1538059 however i already know it moves the rule book backward

1538147 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1538148 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1538149 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1538150 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1538151 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged

1538169 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1538170 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1538171 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1538172 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1538173 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1538174 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1538175 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1538176 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1538177 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1538178 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children

1538228 the issue is bigger than mohamed dheeres dismissal i personally believe that the intention is to disrupt prime minister nur addes reconciliation process
1538229 mohamed dheeres firing cannot result with 10 cabinet ministers resigning but the president yusuf is attempting to bring down the government of prime minister nur adde
1538230 any minister who leaves his post will be replaced and the government will not collapse
1538231 there were 40 of us gathered under a wall to shield us from the mortars but one landed near us

1538237 intentional constant and systematic attempts are being made to erode the achievements of the kemalist ataturk revolution turning religion into an ideology will politicise it and religion will then be the biggest loser
1538238 the military is the sole appointed guardian of the foundation of the turkish republic so they will be allergic to any kind of islamism
1538239 but after what we have just passed through he will be much more cautious than buyukanit
1538240 one of the root causes of the problems in the niger delta is the environmental degradation which emanated mostly from oil pollution you will agree with me that there are challenges in oil spill management ranging from detection and reporting vandalism security compensation and restoration of impacted elements amongst others

1538270 the way i see it the nations of the world are just one big family
1538271 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1538272 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1538273 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1538274 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1538275 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1538276 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1538277 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1538278 in the future we need to be more hands on and proactive on issues that engage our image and credibility
1538279 it is heavily image based we cannot allow to be hijacked by pressure groups and vested interests
1538280 let make extremely brutal family friendly if it worked in rome we can do it

1538351 additional amounts may have to be borrowed from wheeler fund in 2008 to cover the 18 000 000 that was spent in 2007 on the bmc west lumber yard
1538352 it will depend on the rett actual collections and what happens with the bond issue
1538353 it is unusual for a city to get so over leveraged in its funding
1538354 assured we will be paid back in full within 24 months
1538355 if the council approves issuance of bonds for reimbursement for previous land acquisitions
1538356 that money will be used to pay back the wheeler fund
1538357 at a rate changing monthly equal to the monthly rate of return on the citys investment portfolio with annual principal and interest payments due through december 31 2008
1538358 proceeds from the loan were used for capital expenditures related to the acquisition of in the red for affordable housing city of aspen owes wheeler millions real property for affordable housing purposes
1538359 using the wheeler fund is a way of circumventing the will of the people
1538360 theyre not supposed to use it for anything else doesnt that seem to be sidestepping the intended use of that fund theyre borrowing it with every intention of paying it back so its not a violation but its borrowing money to buy a new car and then saying you have to give me a raise because i just bought a new car
1538361 i think we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china

1538363 this didnt necessarily extend to free access and reporting on everything that relates to china

1538384 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1538385 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1538386 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1538387 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1538388 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1538389 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1538390 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties

1538395 but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and put myself in a pressure situation heading into this event i would have loved to have won last week theres no arguing that point but i really needed to be there like i was
1538396 when im playing a course im trying to take half the trouble out of play
1538397 so i want to set up down the right edge of the fairway and hit a cut and if i miss it left it doesnt bother me what bothers me is if i hook it
1538398 because i missed it to the side i wanted to miss it
1538399 nothing ever was going to get as tough as birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
1538400 the irony will be that the u s open could be the easiest course we play all year
1538401 if one of the big hitters is piping it theyre going to have a good week
1538402 we understand that the european court has today ordered that abu hamzas extradition should be stayed while it considers his appeal against extradition to the us

1538419 charismatic and or pentecostal however i do agree with the bible mans viewpoint that there are a lot of false prophets and revivals out there and that a true revival is a revival of the truth of the bible
1538420 u s should add troops to prevent disaster in iraq
1538421 not only did saddam hussein not have weapons of mass destruction but the clinton administrations much criticized 1998 bombing raids nearly toppled his regime and made it entirely possible to contain iraqi aggression
1538422 compared to war all other forms of human endeavor are insignificant
1538423 when i look back on the processes of history when i survey the genesis of america i see this written over every page that the nations are renewed from the bottom not from the top that the genius which springs up from the ranks of unknown men is the genius which renews the youth and energy of the people
1538424 i am not bound to win but i am bound to be true i am not bound to succeed but i am bound to live up to what light i have i must stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong

1538435 in fact look at what i can do that you cant
1538436 fucking you got me rather hot and bothered so i think ill just take care of that
1538437 youd like it wouldnt you to taste me after i finish while i put my mouth between your legs and mmm thats a happy thought

1538450 wes was kind of on the d l too i dont think he dug the word bisexual any more than i do you know girls can be bi and thats kind of hot but who the fuck wants to do a bisexual guy
1538451 you might want to ask a non bi guy that question next time
1538452 the question is why do you keep on being the same kind of asshole
1538453 im not very good at being on the d l
1538454 i mean even i knew about wesley i just thought with him being dead you wouldnt get back on the horse so fast but charles youre not the kind of guy whos good at being shady you give yourself away
1538455 we didnt mean to do it but it would happen anyway and i thought i could decide what i wanted later
1538456 i just dont know what to do now do you
1538457 not big on liars on the other hand good guys are hard to find
1538458 that for everyone involved its better i just keep my mouth shut and accept the consequences
1538459 sorry didnt mean it to come out that way but i dont know what to do either
1538460 which again has us back to why are you a genuinely good dude with good taste fucking yourself over for no reason
1538461 i announce to the world that hey im ac dc bisexual queer whatever and itll work out
1538462 but it would have prevented the unfortunate situation here where anne and i are going to go get a coffee and some doughnuts and youre going to try to figure out how to make it right
1538463 those lawyers they told me lilah wouldnt speak to me because shes dead thats absurd lilah couldnt very well be dead she called me day before yesterday to tell me shed seen you this week
1538464 would you i would ask thomas but it wouldnt be good for his heart to hear that some fool of a secretary thinks lilahs dead hes fond of her you see she looked so much like his mother the poisonous old bitch
1538465 all right you just keep calm and ill call you back
1538466 i have to call los angeles now to make sure patricia she has senile dementia she forgets but i think patricia knows that its true or she wouldnt have called me
1538467 mr angel is very busy at the moment whos your sister
1538468 lilah morgan fucking lilah fucking morgan former head of the goddamn la office so dont tell me mr angel is too fucking busy to take my call
1538469 willow how many fucking lilah morgans do you think there are at wolfram and hart
1538470 willow was right youre hot and lilah was right youre not a romantic notion
1538471 she said boyfriends were romantic notions and i knew her
1538472 god this is fucked up im really sorry that it had to happen now
1538473 i should have thought to see if there was family
1538474 lilah was not particularly forthcoming in her life story i assumed otherwise
1538475 she was like that ever since i knew her too of course shes fifteen years older than me so i never knew her when she was really young young when she wasnt the way she is was my mom is only ten years older than her was i mean
1538476 i thought her family was dead and not one of the wealthiest families in america
1538477 she was difficult and proud and stubborn to the very end i told her to get out of town lilah wouldnt go she fought to stop the beast and she didnt deserve to die the way she died
1538478 she fought against the beast why did he cut off her line of credit
1538479 i didnt think she was you know your sister more resourceful than anyone on this earth and there were others who needed my help so much more
1538480 i think in a slightly different world we loved each other more than i can possibly imagine
1538481 and nobody has ever known me the way she did which still rather terrifies me
1538482 what i suggest is that we clarify what this is because if its just you tarzan me jane its been fun but im not really interested in losing my job or getting a cap in my ass for a little bump and grind
1538483 could you not sound like a third rate angel imitator its so boring
1538484 unless youve got a big broody gift youd like to share with the class then i could put up with fourth rate imitation even

1538509 why the concern give me ten minutes you can i dont know try the tv theres probably something drinkable in the kitchen if you get scotch i want one too on the rocks
1538510 youve spoken about my time as though it matters twice now
1538511 i couldnt believe it when i read the incantation it was in a stuffy old manuscript my father had given me all herblore and household accounts and then right after an account of the man of wyndam manor selling cows at double the price he wished a spell to make a love encounter unforgettable
1538512 have some faith in my esoteric abilities as well as the ones well proven
1538513 wander in get a blow job dont even manage to say anything except i think fuck youre so clearly the man ive been dreaming about since mom got me barbies dream house
1538514 and every man aspires to a shrill corporate whore who spends her many free evenings plotting murder and other petty crimes
1538515 if im your whore youre the john paying for what other men get for free
1538516 wait did i just see what i thought i saw
1538517 for too long the middle east has been governed by zero sum logic one sides loss was seen as the others gain this thinking has brought much suffering to our region
1538518 what does walk off mean does it refer to the losing team walking off the field or the winning team walking off the field

1538526 two senior administration officials told me his wife suggested sending wilson to niger to investigate the italian report
1538527 bob has boundless enthusiasm for political journalism an unmatched capacity for work and an enduring affection for the sun times
1538528 although he wrote three columns a week a newsletter and books and appeared regularly on television he always was ready to do more for sun times readers whenever big news broke bob was there volunteering to write an extra article for the paper whenever i asked him to do something special for us he had only one response when do you need it he always got it in before that deadline and it always reflected the superb reporting and analytical and interpretive talents he demonstrated in his columns across four and a half decades
1538529 oi ginny whats the matter dont you want a biscuit
1538530 were going to improve them a bit i think theres a firm up north wholl pay top dollar for breath brightening biscuits
1538531 alas little sister i fear theres no market in reputable wizarding firms that want breath brightening biscuits its a set of muggle chemists but theyre paying good cash for it and we always reinvest the money from muggle jobs back into the r amp d of the shop
1538532 if the ministry finds out youll be out a fair bit in fines
1538533 when would the ministry have time to investigate biscuits that banish bad breath
1538534 theyve got you know who to worry about ginny and so do we hence were doing our duty for britain by creating the best charmed products anyones ever seen anyway you still havent said why youre so quiet
1538535 dean michael harry hermione take a guess win a prize
1538536 oh come off it were pleased as we can be by you little sister youre the heir to our throne so to speak
1538537 and in any case youre as good a troublemaker as any
1538538 so who is it come on now well tell you which one of us angelinas dating this week
1538539 well thats not much use is it by the time i see angelina again shell be dating the other its very white teeth of her and i suspect youre all three putting me on about it
1538540 and why are you so keen to know what i was thinking about mostly i was just thinking that i wanted to shake hermione and ron for being twits and harry for good measure
1538541 i dont envy you having to listen to hermione once that daft luna gets her hooks into ron
1538542 im dead bored and i think the twins are plotting to use me as a test subject again
1538543 ive got all the time in the world for you ginny youve got to tell me how you always manage to interrupt at just the most welcome moment sometime
1538544 les doy mi bendicion cuidala como yo no lo supe hacer ash
1538545 did you seems to me you were enjoying yourself without me
1538546 perhaps its a test of edges such as how long will she allow him to embrace her in public how far will he allow himself to be teased before he has her pinned against the grass
1538547 you know how to make a dress worth ruining lover
1538548 you wouldnt have had such a good time wrecking me if id looked anything less than the best
1538549 in vietnam we simply quit on our ally the south and came home and it is beginning to to be a very good question whether we may not wind up doing the same in iraq
1538550 how many times do i have to tell you im going to
1538551 i think the answer im looking for is hell no
1538552 why would you want to come in to drink white wine spritzers chat about all the things we have in common and order a pizza
1538553 though i bet most of your minions bootlickers and various one night stands dont recognize kate bush
1538554 the original answer stands because you have no reason to speak to me in fact given whom you work for sorry whom you worked for im thinking that i could call lapd and get a restraining order slapped on you and the boy blunders if you dont give me a reason not to now
1538555 you have my attention hands atop your head and ill let you in
1538556 i have a flight to salt lake city in the morning im going to go put the fear of god into a local office give em a thrill the usual so dont mind me if i keep packing
1538557 i believe you were saying you had some information about angels disappearance that youd like me to know which leads me to believe you would also like me to find big broody yes
1538558 champion big time apocalypse player you cant tell me wolfram and hart isnt bending their resources to find him
1538559 wolfram and hart as a matter of fact is playing it safe
1538560 no angel means no trouble for our evil schemes my bosses think the quiet is a good thing
1538561 youre not stupid even if you are a hateful bitch
1538562 right to the heart there honey so maybe i do have my own methods of keeping tabs on the finding angel efforts what do you know thatll help them
1538563 of course cordelia never showed and they found her car emptied as though by divine intervention no signs of struggle nothing all of thats in the police report you filed
1538564 i think it was related to holtz and that girl that girl justine because if youve seen the police report you also know there are some peculiarities about holtzs death even from the lack of autopsy
1538565 i mean its a little convenient isnt it holtz disappears one night the same night lapd gets a call about a dead man in a skid row motel with no blood left in him and the next day a homeless woman brought in bloody sheets ten blocks from the motel but no one saw anything else
1538566 its a little bit of a leap to think that was our old friend holtz
1538567 but lets say i believe you why off himself like that
1538568 that doesnt make sense are you thirsty i need a glass of water
1538569 why arent you sharing your conspiracy theory with your boyfriend and angels kid
1538570 because i think connor might know and i dont think charles and i could pull together the resources to salvage angel without him or with him for that matter why havent you come after connor
1538571 it could just be justine you know whos gone to ground i tried to find her but its hard to find someone who doesnt want to be found
1538572 people who dont want to be found dust up a lot of trail trying to erase themselves and justine annoys fuck out of everyone im sure i can find someone whod like to see her dead
1538573 holtz and justine stage holtzs murder so the kid wrestles angel to the ground for them and then they get rid of him sweet sweet revenge im just fuzzy on why little connor didnt kill him
1538574 maybe he thought of a way to make him suffer
1538575 i like connor but hes not exactly you know stable
1538576 so what now miss burkle where do we go from here
1538577 ive got my own skin to think about and running around asking about holtz and justine isnt the way to keep it intact
1538578 what did you think this was redeem a lawyer night
1538579 its been fun and all listening to you give it up like a virgin on prom night but i did not get to where i was by finding big eyed skinny do gooders irresistible
1538580 it occasionally goes wrong but most of the time human perceptions so unreliable that it takes a real idiot to screw it up
1538581 now i know why wesleys got justine in his closet and that is very useful indeed
1538582 can you get back to the office weve got a surprise case and i think were going to need you fred
1538583 ella no ten a derecho de hacer sentir mal a suiseiseki
1538584 cuidar s de ella por siempre y ambas se proteger n la una a la otra

1538588 i got the same answer from congressman ralph regula republican from ohio several times i would love to know the true story
1538589 i never ratted on a n a i never prosecuted a n a i never locked up a n a that is first and foremost i always felt being the man that i am and the boss that i am i never owed a n a an explanation every man gotta look his kids in the eye and have a reason for feeding them or not for that sole reason i believed in the death penalty for rats and informants
1538590 i surpassed my life goals 18 months ago but you see where i am now sitting in a new benz 100 000 grand cash in my pocket and a dirty white tee you know im strapped to the teeth we got more bullets than we got dollars thats just how it goes and thats how its going to go until the day we die a n dont like it get at me im the muthf kin biggest boss that you seen this far
1538591 im the muthf kin biggest boss that you seen this far
1538592 the biggest muthf kin boss that you seen this far
1538593 the bottom line here is that folks hard earned money has been stolen and the law has been broken
1538594 expelling me from the sorority for fulfilling my fiduciary duty to the members of zeta and informing them that their dues and other contributions are being spent on clothes shoes furs jewelry fast food and liquor will not change the fact that money has been stolen and the law has been broken the law doesnt magically change because youve thrown me out
1538595 our i team investigation found that moore spent nearly 400 000 dollars on what appear to be personal items
1538596 129 dollars on panty hose wilsons leather designer sportswear ladies shoes day wear st johns st johns st johns
1538597 the sorority has splintered and the rebel forces are hunkering down
1538598 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1538599 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1538600 i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1538601 every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1538602 we would all properly inflate our tires we could save as much gasoline as
1538603 a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1538604 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1538605 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1538606 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1538607 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1538608 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
1538609 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1538610 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1538611 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
1538612 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
1538613 weve been receiving e mails from my brother so we knew it was coming
1538614 where people who have led good lives are eternally rewarded
1538615 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
1538616 where people who have led good lives are eternally rewarded
1538617 i am the way and the truth and the life no man comes to the father but through me
1538618 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1538619 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1538620 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
1538621 the picture on the source page shows a very red faced wjc angry or hung over
1538622 im still convinced that senator hillary clinton has something up her sleeve or shed have released her delegates
1538623 i would strongly prefer hillary over obama i would strongly prefer bill over hillary i hope she does pull something at the convention and i even hope it works because if mccain loses to a dem id much rather it be hillary than obama

1538631 to hell with the un to hell with the secretary general to hell with the world court to hell with mexico and its meddling and to hell with medellin tonight
1538632 an unlikely cast of legal allies including the bush administration and much of the worlds diplomatic community embraced medellins position warning that the united states will be accused of violating the treaty if medellin is executed without a hearing on his consular access claim the case pitted president bush against his home state of texas
1538633 put simply the united states seeks the help of the state of texas

1538640 unlike john kerry im not gonna flip flop when i make a prediction i stick with it
1538641 there was no deal no quid pro quo this is my call and my best judgement about how to stop the long slow slide into another long stalemate
1538642 i applaud the wisdom of senator perata for making this decision

1538645 the industry has amassed dozens of independently researched studies which are peer reviewed and published in academic journals showing lower than normal adverse secondary effects
1538646 discutir a rela o ainda que inconscientemente intr nseco ao ser humano um ato que sempre existiu antigamente isto era vis vel nos passeios de bra os dados nas conversas em volta da fogueira nos casais sentados nos bancos das pra as vendo o luar o tempo passou chegou o muito a fazer no dia a dia responsabilidades demais competi o desenfreada e os sentimentos foram ficando em segundo plano nesse momento deu se o nome de discutir a rela o a uma necessidade premente de conversar desabafar dizer ao outro o que se sente enfim estreitar la os com vistas a um futuro a dois mais prolongado
1538647 algumas mulheres imaginam que colocando para fora todas as suas angustias medos e ansiedade resolveram seus problemas emocionais e de relacionamento elas pensam em voz alta isso pode funcionar muito bem entre as amigas mas com o companheiro um risco muito grande no momento da raiva e da explos o as palavras podem ser mal colocadas e as conseq ncias desastrosas
1538648 hoje em dia os homens mudaram muito ainda bem muitos lavam cozinham participam ativamente da educa o dos filhos discutem a rela o e n o se sentem menos homem por causa disso eles t m consci ncia de que s o 50 respons veis pela felicidade do casal mas tomar a iniciativa n o privil gio nem dever apenas de um lado da rela o toma iniciativa quem se sente incomodado e mais que isso deseja abrir seu cora o e dar entrada para uma troca produtiva de sentimentos toma iniciativa quem ama de verdade e deseja seu companheiro inteiro ao seu lado

1538654 traditional christian values in which this country was founded upon
1538655 every american every day blows out a liter or more of methane from his or her rear
1538656 im today sending congress a bill to cause the immediate tapering off of this flatus and outlaw it entirely with criminal penalties by 2025 that will plug up this threat when ill probably be dead from old age
1538657 as i speak there are 304 million americans popping methane into the atmosphere thats a lot of methane and were adding five persons every minute to our population many of them from cultures that eat a lot of beans its not hard to sniff a national emergency here
1538658 i recognize theres a good argument that farting is natural and necessary heavenly but its not as good as the arguments for the unrestricted burning of coal and oil and natural gas to light our houses and move our cars god ordained those too
1538659 is being mislead by other ivy leaguers on his staff elitists global warming not exist and if it did it could not be stopped because god wanted it farting is a god given right and necessity
1538660 its good bush finally acts to curb what he has long denied even existed i for one think we could do better though by piping our anal emissions into jars for burning in stoves and fireplaces we could set up special jars in our homes and offices and schools
1538661 we dont mind passing anything that wont take effect until 2025
1538662 but we do mind constraining americans from a practice all indulge from birth expect long and serious hearings on this
1538663 anything that will sell more beef is a good thing
1538664 a poof that will below away in the wind hes truckling to the coal companies and the tree huggers and other cowboys the right to fart is implicit in the constitution well go to the supreme court on this if we have to the catholic majority there will recognize that once you ban farts youll ban incense next
1538665 we learned from the oil companies that the best way to make money in the airline business is to conspire
1538666 and the easiest way for airlines to do that without talking about it other than at cocktail parties is to rotate being first to raise fares and fees thus avoiding the possibility of federal price fixing indictments of course so long a republican sits in the white house theres no chance of that happening anyway but its better to keep up the practice than lose your skills
1538667 mainly thanks to the excuse of rising oil prices we intend to double our fares by the end of summer
1538668 there are other fees weve had to raise to keep ourselves solvent and to keep fuel tanks full enough to get each flight to an airport even if its not the one you want
1538669 but couldnt come up with a good figure for each breath of stale air we will be charging in the future though for each rage by passengers crazed by claustrophobia high temperatures lack of air water and toilets
1538670 an each attendant they beat up costs us money so were going to have to charge for that
1538671 we wanted to make a city building game where the player is more personally involved instead of controlling an abstract floating hand
1538672 will feature fun and light hearted gameplay with stunning visuals and original music to match
1538673 with the lower price point the game is among the best values available this summer and a must own for hardcore gamers budding game designers and action fans alike
1538674 most modern players are aware of the realism and skill of the pro evolution soccer series

1538686 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1538687 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1538688 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1538689 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1538690 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1538691 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1538692 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1538693 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1538694 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1538695 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1538783 i feel like usually im probably the loud one before the game but in no way shape or form am i on this team
1538784 i came up as a second hitter so i really wasnt thinking about home runs it just happened

1538789 i looked out the window of the door that goes to the back and i saw the bird feeder laying on the ground

1538805 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1538806 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1538807 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1538808 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1538809 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1538810 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1538811 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security

1538842 we agree that the amended report did not adequately explain the factual basis for the experts causation opinion on how a surgeons absent operative report delayed the patients diagnosis and treatment
1538843 therefore we reverse the trial courts order and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion
1538844 in carters first surgery on august 12 2005 dr schrapps re sectioned the first portion of carters duodenum and did a truncal vagotomy on aug 31 dr schrapps performed carters second surgery to explore for a leak related to the prior surgery but none was found
1538845 drainage from the surgical drains decreased and this was interpreted as representing closure of the fistula
1538846 memorial hermann baptist further objected that dr machos report did not demonstrate that he was qualified as an expert on administrative standards applicable to hospitals
1538847 several months for surgeons to discover why rickey carter was having medical complications
1538848 baptist also renewed its objection that dr machos report did not demonstrate his qualifications to render opinions on the standard of care hospitals follow on their record monitoring practices
1538849 the report adequately states the standard of care regarding post operative reports how baptist allegedly breached the standard of care and how baptists alleged breach of the standard of care caused carters injuries
1538850 the report explains that baptists alleged breach of the standard of care deprived carters treating physicians of important information concerning the full extent of carters initial surgery and the complications during that surgery and that this alleged breach delayed the discovery of the true cause of carters post operative symptoms and necessitated multiple subsequent surgeries
1538851 but an opinion is not enough as the texas supreme court has held to establish causation a report must contain sufficient facts explaining the experts conclusions and must show causation beyond mere conjecture
1538852 in this case we conclude that dr macho did not provide sufficient facts to sufficiently explain how baptists alleged omissions caused delays in carters treatment instead dr machos amended report bases its causation analysis on several assumptions about carters treatment at baptist and at st lukes that are inconsistent with the medical records placed in evidence at the hearing

1538969 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems
1538970 but nothing in terms of looking at an issue that has this array of legal moral and even spiritual questions attached to it
1538971 did any of you go to those obama grassroots platform parties
1538972 i assume the political responsibility of all what has been done
1538973 the commission would focus strictly on detention torture and extraordinary rendition
1538974 i would have interviewed the guards on tango block to determine the exact level of hamdans sleep deprivation
1538975 of course we will allow drilling once the petro companies drill where they already have license if they refuse we will give those rights to other concerns plus they will lose all rights to bid on future projects
1538976 our homicide investigators are en route to interview this individual rockefeller in connection to a missing persons report from the early 1990s out of san marino calif
1538977 con man who often surfaces in affluent neighborhoods and mingles in social circles by making friends with wealthy influential people he often volunteers for good causes like raising money for charity
1538978 from the time of the abduction to today special agents from the fbi as well as boston police detectives have worked around the clock trying to figure out who rockefeller is
1538979 its been roughly nine days since they started this process and before 1993 we are no closer to knowing who this defendant is he has used various aliases
1538980 we cannot even verify that he is a united states citizen we cannot find even basic documentation of that fact he has simply no ties to anywhere the only ties that he has are to sandra boss and reigh there is no record of any clark rockefeller before 1993 and he has not provided any information for us to document who he is
1538981 it seems to be getting harder and harder every year to get enough girls to participate
1538982 usually at this time of year there are three to four already registered but this year there are none
1538983 the last thing wed ever want to do is not have the pageant
1538984 this isnt an oxford competition they can be from amherst pugwash parrsboro advocate wentworth or where ever
1538985 for each participant in the pageant that represents eight to 10 people who come through our gates
1538986 its a special delight to be talking about the environment and the green economy while being in one of the most sustainable buildings in the province
1538987 the joggins fossil centre is the perfect example of what needs to be done as we seek to move nova scotia forward on a more sustainable and environmentally friendly pattern
1538988 the green features of this building are a direct result of the commitment and dedication of nova scotians to create a world class facility which is what youve done here that promotes environmental stewardship
1538989 we all know that what we have here in nova scotia is worth protecting and worth caring for we recognize that we must adopt even stronger environmental policies and we must come up with new economic models that incorporate sustainability at the very core of the model
1538990 the second is to overcome the spirit of pessimism which is too often a part of our psyche
1538991 we have to get over the feeling that were fighting a losing battle and talk about the winning ones
1538992 it is important for all nova scotians to understand that managing the environment and economy for future prosperity for this province is a shared responsibility government business and community all have a role to play
1538993 our goal is to achieve economic performance above a national average by 2020
1538994 this year we seem to be ahead of last year for sure
1538995 i guess were optimistic of seeing some positive numbers up from last year
1538996 recent inquiry regarding contributions to the lawyers for working oklahomans political action committee has resulted in a barrage of harsh remarks and demands from rep
1538997 representative worthen who is completing his final term in office as he as is not seeking re election also works as a paid political consultant on behalf of republican campaigns per the
1538998 it is not surprising that representative worthen would latch onto an outlandish investigation that without merit made allegations of illegality and that he would demand the return of campaign funds of democratic candidates
1538999 i dont need this right now and im sure youd like to hang on to it
1539000 if anyone had gotten this far without one they deserved to get in
1539001 nobody was trying to look see if it was actually going to hit the building or not hit the building so everybody was running in the opposite direction for their lives
1539002 which is quite accurate and further demonstrates how his perspective of the angle of approach could be easily skewed from that location
1539003 how does parkinsons disease impact the body what about the mind how do families cope in the face of a progressive disease
1539004 esta situaci n tiene que movilizar a toda la sociedad y nos indigna tanto a autoridades como a ciudadanos y precisamente este tipo de hechos pone de manifiesto la urgencia de que m s all de banderas partidistas y pol ticas los gobernantes nos unamos en torno a la muy justa exigencia y demanda de la sociedad para acabar con la impunidad con la que opera la delincuencia organizada en nuestro pa s para acabar precisamente con la criminalidad

1539057 because things didnt go the way i wanted internationally i retain a drive to do well that perhaps other players like yourself who achieved a great deal at international level might not have had
1539058 dont trust anyone and the ones you think you can trust dont
1539059 what are redmonds precise plans in the data warehouse dw appliance segment
1539060 reference architectures are the way major vendors have co opted the appliance story a big part of why microsoft bought us is that we have the expertise and the ability to take that reference architecture to a whole new level and leapfrog oracle in terms of getting that reference architecture right
1539061 t hey really werent an appliance vendor since they just provided software the emc dell deal was the transition where they still sold it as an appliance but there wasnt really a requirement to run it on that hardware
1539062 if they layer their software completely on top of the database then there isnt much there because to get real performance and stability you still have to muck around somewhat lower than the sql processing layer
1539063 t he term data warehouse appliance has been misappropriated by several vendors from small ones with oxymoronic software appliances to large ones that offer bundles of hardware and software products
1539064 although we may not like it the term data warehouse appliance means many things nowadays and the original meaning popularized by netezza has eroded considerably
1539065 in that context id say that datallegro comes closer to the original meaning than most
1539066 whether youre looking at an appliance or an appliance like offering youre still addressing the same problem and in degrees
1539067 the beauty of something like oow might not be that its an appliance because the word appliance sets a level of expectation with the customer and historically in the it world of something that you plug it in its in a box its closed off theres a shell built around the hardware so that when you plug it in it just does its thing with little setup involved
1539068 a lot of the folks who call themselves an appliance im not sure theyve achieved that with their products
1539069 the promise of an appliance such as neoview or an appliance like product such as the oracle optimized warehouse is that youre bringing everything into this consolidated environment youre making it much easier for customers to focus just on solving business problems instead of focusing on the hardware or the tuning or trouble shooting any issues that are bound to crop up
1539070 we found that when the experimenters mimicked yawning 21 out of 29 dogs showed contagious yawning so this is a very strong and reliable effect
1539071 none of the dogs in the control group yawned we know contagious yawning is linked to empathy so it may mean dogs can empathise well with humans but we need to do more tests to be sure
1539072 theres no question that we want to build from our infrastructure success in hardware and leverage that in business intelligence and data warehousing
1539073 when you think about it hp bladesystem is an ideal platform for an appliance its an enclosure its a 13
1539074 it really is a data warehouse in a box for customers that who to move in that direction
1539075 when we launched the oracle optimized warehouse we had 60 percent better energy efficiency than our competition thats huge from a cost of energy perspective youre spending 35 to 40 cents on a dollar for bladesystem compared to the competition
1539076 were reaching a point in the industry right now where it costs as much to power a server or storage over the life of that component than it does to acquire it up front
1539077 with bladesystems energy efficiency its flexibility it is an absolutely fantastic platform for an appliance like offering because in that enclosure you can determine what kind of server capabilities you need what kind of storage mix how can you create a balanced configuration once you have it you have incredible flexibility inside that box to be able to power database appliances
1539078 i think that neoview obviously was built on a fault tolerant database that was really architected for this new world of bi where its not just a matter of having to load the data into the data warehouse once a day or twice a day its happening in real time
1539079 a lot of the legacy data warehouse systems and even some of the data warehouse systems that our competitors are building are built and architected for specific kinds of queries for large queries they werent architected for mixed queries or for all of the data warehousing workloads in existence today
1539080 neoview has always been based on our standard integrity servers combined with our standard storage systems that were selling other people
1539081 but yes there isnt currently a neoview blade version and im not sure just how much i can say about our roadmap right now
1539082 its not that size is everything but that is one differentiator between oow and neoview
1539083 the oracle optimized warehouse was targeted at 1 2 3 and 4 tb modules the neoview implementations tend to be larger than that range so there really is no cannibalization no overlap
1539084 the other significant differentiation is that the neoview implementations we do tend to focus more on enterprise data warehousing tend to be a little bit larger of a company tend to involve more mixed workloads we dont really see much overlap at all between the market that oow is going after and neoview
1539085 our customers have consistently come to us and asked us to make it simpler for them to deliver infrastructure in the custom world its a very challenging thing for a customer to figure out a dw bi workload and what its going to look like and predict it and then once they do that the idea of figuring out whats the right hardware sizing and configuration
1539086 theyre wrestling with all of these issues what storage do i bring in how do i set up my database how do i partition it stuff like that
1539087 what we find is that in the test and development stages our customers go through a pretty rigorous process of trying to figure out if they have the right stuff and there are a lot of times where theyll run into a problem and theyre trying to figure out why its not performing and they go to the hardware folks who say youve got to go to the dba so they go to the dba who says its storage and so on

1539093 but i think the captaincy might curb his flair as a player

1539097 this has been a traumatic period for all those who have suffered from his vile campaign
1539098 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
1539099 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
1539100 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice

1539141 canadian gun owner are slowly digging our own graves with our timid apologetic approach to gun rights most canadian gun owners and most canadian pro gun organizations have utilized a sporting purposes only argument in support of civilian gun ownership self defense has become a taboo topic this reticence is a huge blunder by failing to actively promote handgun ownership for self defense we leave ourselves tongue tied at the most critical juncture in the gun control debate the aftermath of a mass murder the march towards civilian disarmament has followed the same pattern in nearly every english speaking nation pro gun and anti gun forces generally battle to a draw until there is a mass murder involving firearms after a massacre has taken place outraged citizens will grasp at any solution regardless of how limited its chance of success it is at these times the gun grabbers have scored their greatest victories
1539142 the pattern has been repeated so many times you would think gun owners would have recognized the pitfalls by now time and time again we are drawn into the same debate time and time again we offer the same ineffectual arguments time and time again we lose and the noose is pulled ever tighter around our necks
1539143 pro gun forces have failed completely to grasp the mechanics of the debate the public is seeking a method of minimizing the possibility a similar massacre could happen again our opponents suggest numerous ways of tightening gun control laws which they say will prevent a comparable tragedy we then attempt to demonstrate why their plans are not feasible but we never offer any viable solutions of our own when backed into a corner and pressed to provide some kind of positive suggestion we will mutter something about bringing back the death penalty or increasing penalties for the use of a firearm in a crime but harsh punishment would be completely ineffective as a strategy to combat mass murder in the majority of cases the murder kills himself it is unlikely the threat of a long prison term would be much of a deterrent to someone who has decided to commit suicide in a blaze of gunfire there is only one very effective method of preventing mass murder which does not involve gun prohibition but it is one canadian gun owners have typically been loath to suggest concealed carry of handguns

1539158 house democratic leaders are strongly considering dropping anti discrimination protections for transgender persons from the employment non discrimination act or enda after an internal democratic head count on wednesday found that the bill would likely be defeated if it included the trans provision multiple sources familiar with the bill said
1539159 as of late wednesday it appeared likely that the trans provision would be removed setting up a potentially divisive fight within gay activist circles over whether or not to support an enda bill that excludes trans people
1539160 the leader of one of the nations most prominent transgender rights groups expressed strong skepticism over reports that support for the transgender provision was eroding
1539161 i do think we have the votes to pass this bill said mara keisling executive director of the national center for transgender rights

1539171 those most concerned with global warming wont consider nuclear energy as an alternative
1539172 wind solar cellulose based biofuels are the way we need to go i do not favor nuclear power we havent built a nuclear power plant in decades in this country there is a reason for that the reason is it is extremely costly it takes an enormous amount of time to get one planned developed and built and we still dont have a safe way to dispose of the nuclear waste it is a huge problem for america over the long term
1539173 im agnostic about nuclear power john is right that until we figure out what were going to do with the waste and the cost its very hard to see nuclear as a part of our future but thats where american technology comes in lets figure out what were going to do about the waste and the cost if we think nuclear should be a part of the solution
1539174 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix there are no silver bullets to this issue we have to develop solar i have proposed drastically increasing fuel efficiency standards on cars an aggressive cap on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted

1539394 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1539395 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1539396 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1539397 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1539398 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1539399 who are open to doing something on the production side
1539400 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1539401 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1539402 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1539403 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1539404 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1539405 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1539406 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1539407 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1539408 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1539409 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1539410 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1539411 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1539412 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1539413 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1539414 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1539415 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1539416 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1539417 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1539418 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1539419 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1539420 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1539421 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1539422 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1539423 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1539424 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1539425 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1539426 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1539427 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1539428 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1539429 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1539430 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1539431 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1539432 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1539433 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1539434 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1539435 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1539436 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1539437 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1539438 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1539439 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1539440 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1539441 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1539442 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1539443 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1539444 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1539445 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1539446 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1539447 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1539448 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1539449 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1539450 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1539451 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1539452 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1539453 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1539454 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1539455 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1539456 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1539457 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1539458 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1539459 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1539460 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1539461 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1539462 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1539463 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1539464 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1539465 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1539466 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1539467 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1539468 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1539469 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1539470 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1539471 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1539472 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1539473 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1539474 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1539475 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

1539482 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1539483 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1539484 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1539485 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1539486 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1539487 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1539488 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1539489 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago

1539494 drax is now facing higher prices for co2 while receiving less free credits following the start of phase 2 of the eu ets however the outlook for drax has improved substantially over the last 6 12 months with higher oil prices more than offsetting the impact of higher coal prices and leading to higher forward margins for drax

1539501 el tc tiene por mandato de su propio origen defender la constituci n la cual tiene un art culo que se refiere a los principios y los derechos fundamentales y entre ellos se destaca el derecho a la vida por ello nada debe estar en el orden de las decisiones del tc por encima de la protecci n a la vida ni la sanci n contra aquellos que han atentado contra ella

1539523 when i had the initial conversation with him i explained we were not asking you to be our everyday center fielder were only asking you to go out there when you feel great

1539525 weve been constantly reminding players to re hydrate themselves drinking water and gatorade just in practices is not enough
1539526 if someone has lost more than 2 3 percent of their body weight between any two weigh ins then they are way behind schedule on their hydration
1539527 thirst is not a good indicator of how well hydrated you are
1539528 if you are thirsty you are already behind on your hydration level
1539529 its obvious to me you guys want to get better there is no complaining or whining about things

1539551 it might help people like first time buyers who need a deposit for a house but the fundamental problems in the housing market go deeper than that
1539552 arrangement fees have risen sharply so any reduction in the money that house buyers have to shell out up front is good
1539553 it would marginally boost sentiment and reduce expectations over how far and how long
1539554 this could in turn cause some potential buyers to return to the market particularly if the scrapping of stamp duty is only for a specific limited period
1539555 but its not going to turn the thing around sometime soon as the problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep
