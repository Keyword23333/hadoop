2280020 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this these subtilised interpretations are highly manifold according to their nature and have almost nothing to do with the original text for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people as far as my experience goes they are also no better than other human groups although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power otherwise i cannot see anything chosen about them

2280051 remember that for most consumer products there is only one key goal the most frequent and or important user goal that the product is intended to support as it says in the standard this means that each participant will be asked to carry out just one or two tasks with the product so the participant session time should be much shorter than with thinking aloud testing my estimate is that each participant could be briefed tested and sent on his or her way in 20 minutes

2280083 in aesthetic medicine and especially in the surgical field there are therapies that present a much greater risk to patients than what is theoretically possible with lipodissolve injections as example of this i would merely refer to the figures available on the number of serious incidents following liposuction and the frequently unsatisfactory aesthetic results from cosmetic surgery recent reported data published in austria claim that 1 10 of all liposuction procedures either result in surgical deformities or patient discontentment the figure being far higher than what had been expected lipodissolve can eliminate many risks apart from deformities resulting from surgery to compare the risks facing older patients side effects from surgery requiring general anesthesia can involve a distinct loss of cognitive functions affecting the patients everyday life and living more recent studies indicate that we cannot fully exclude the possibility that alteration in mental functions can occur even in younger people who undergo any form of surgery that require anesthesia from these reports and taking in consideration the many risks associated with surgery it is surprising that lipodissolve injections has been the target of much faulty criticism instead of being accepted with an open but scientific curiosity our safety reports have been very positive and we lack data of immediate adverse side effects even in several thousand cases of clinical use although we naturally wish for more advanced studies and long term studies to give more thorough reports
2280084 what if i could make something like this but someone already did and its so cute and it would have taken forever and somebody else probably inherited it and they didnt see its worth and they brought it in with a bunch of cruddy corning ware but i can honor that first womans work once again i should just get it even if she only wears it once

2280120 it is a package that i think gives dignity to the work that is being done by the security officers many of whom earn 23 500
2280121 the stress associated with trying to make ends meet has been substantially alleviated
2280122 goes a long way to lift hard working security officers out of poverty

2280124 we wanted better wages and benefits for our security officers because we all know what it is like to live and work in san francisco and wanted to see an improvement in the program

2280140 sams campaigning experience combined with his knowledge of the online space made him a natural choice of candidate to head up this new venture and we are delighted that he has decided to join wolfstar at this exciting time
2280141 the media landscape is changing at an astonishing rate new technology is prompting a huge upsurge in activism and as people with common interests are become more networked through the internet public relations as a campaigning discipline sees its most basic model challenged

2280153 above all survival hope development respect dignity equality and justice for women and children
2280154 this is a very hard choice but we think the price is worth it
2280155 in making policy one has to choose between two bad choices and unfortunately the effect of sanctions has been more than we would have hoped
2280156 our sense is that prior to sanctions there was serious poverty and health problems in iraq
2280157 this was obviously a major surprise to me i have never been told this

2280474 if young people dont heed our warnings about safer listening they could end up facing premature hearing damage if you are regularly plugged in its only too easy to clock up noise doses that could damage hearing forever
2280475 when we were performing we used to have a wall of giant amplifiers on either side of us on the stage and i was stuck in the middle
2280476 i was worried i might end up permanently deaf but luckily hearing aids have transformed my life youngsters dont realise how much they are assaulting their ears by going to gigs and clubbing and constantly listening to music at top volume on personal players
2280477 even my own son marc who knows what ive gone through and is a musician has not yet organised ear protection for when hes playing at gigs nor got proper safe headphones for his mp3 player youngsters think as i used to that hearing problems will never happen to them
2280478 tinnitus and noise induced hearing loss occurs when the delicate hair nerve cells that line the inner ear suffer repeated trauma from loud sound vibrations if young people suffer this and they are genetically predisposed to degeneration of hearing with age their hearing loss may happen sooner rather than later
2280479 in general they should not go above the half way level on the volume control the problem is young people may be aware of risks to their sight but cannot so easily imagine deafness and ignore the risks also because music is enjoyable youngsters are more willing to tolerate noise levels which are potentially harmful
2280480 if people experience that they really need to turn down the player straight away and then consult their doctor if the problems persist
2280481 this evidence suggests that people should get better quality headphones if they want to safeguard their hearing
2280482 it you are on a noisy train or car you have to turn the player up to dangerous levels just to hear it over time this is going to lead to problems like tinnitus and severe damage to the inner ear
2280483 if they write they can read it and if we write we can read it
2280484 the proximate cause of industrialization though was the increase in the relative price of manufactured goods with the cessation of trade during the napoleonic wars and possibly the maintenance of a high relative price with the imposition of a tariff on manufactured goods
2280485 trade offered the temperate settlements high income per head from which would immediately ensue a large demand for manufactures opportunities for import substitution and rapid urbanization
2280486 t he americans could have chosen to concentrate exclusively on agriculture to enter manufacturing would have been a choice and the reasons for this hypothetical choice have not been explored
2280487 the proximate cause of industrialization though was the increase in the relative price of manufactured goods with the cessation of trade during the napoleonic wars and possibly the maintenance of a high relative price with the imposition of a tariff on manufactured goods but it was only in the american northeast where the wages of females and boys relative to those of adult men were initially low that this industrial development flourished
2280488 the lower the relative productivity of females and children in the pre industrial agricultural or traditional economy the earlier will manufacturing evolve the proportionately more will the relative wage for females and children increase and the higher will be the ratio of manufactured to agricultural goods
2280489 industrial development lagged behind that of the northeast and differed in form

2280502 modern bourgeois society with its relations of production a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells
2280503 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe it must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connections everywhere the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country
2280504 it is high time that communists should openly in the face of the whole world publish their views their aims their tendencies and meet this nursery tale of the specter of communism with a manifesto of the party itself

2280536 when we say i believe in the resurrection we are not saying that we offer our theoretical assent to the fact that god can do great miracles when we say that we believe in the resurrection we are claiming that our lives follow that pattern that echoes its way through scripture that we identify with jesus in his death his sacrifice and his resurrection ministry if it seems as though gods purposes in us and through us have been defeated the resurrection suggests otherwise god is in the business of healing and forgiving and restoring of course on our part this requires repentance and humility the capacity to be transformed but if we believe in the resurrection our hope is invested not only in a god who will bring us through death to live in his presence but in a god whose living presence transforms our present living if we believe in the resurrection then by gods grace our lives our spiritual material political social lives will be living evidence of that fact that god is in the business of transforming real people healing restoring forgiving if we believe in the resurrection it will beat its rhythm through our lives as day by day we are transformed from one degree of glory to another from one degree of christ reflecting ness to another if we believe in the resurrection then our daily life will be the proof of it because it will bear the fruit of it

2280620 there are times when a patient will want to rely on a family member but unless that person is specifically trained in communicating medical information we would discourage that because we need to make sure that we get complete information from a patient and that what our staff has to convey is being communicated in its entirety
2280621 the result is an inferior health system for patients who do not speak english well and who lack access to doctors or other health care providers who can communicate with them in their primary language

2280724 beste vrienden aan allen die momenteel werken of hebben gewerkt in de voormalige sssr ik schrijf u openhartig omdat het twijfelachtig is of iemand anders zo openhartig zal zijn god wil dat zijn woord neergeschreven in de bijbel dus geen surrogaat in het postcommunistische rusland voortgang heeft velen van ons hebben zich de inspanningen getroost oprecht deze opdracht te vervullen vandaag dient echter openhartig en eerlijk opgemerkt te worden in de praktische dienst en niet in onze verslagen wij in veel opzichten onzuiver waren er werden veel boeken van middelmatige kwaliteit verspreid vanwege het lage niveau van de kwaliteit van de vertaling werd daarin een karikatuur van de christelijke leer weergegeven veel televisie en radiouitzendingen waren eveneens middelmatig het lijkt erop dat hun presentatoren niet christus bewonderden maar zichzelf wij leden veelal aan overmatig zelfvertrouwen wij wisselden de onwetendheid van het russische volk uit tegen onze eigen onverschilligheid wij hebben getracht het alledaagse voor te stellen als openbaring van god onze predikers gaven miljoenen dollars uit voor de huur van stadions reclame en wervende religieuze literatuur op het dwaalspoor van eigenzinnigheid hebben wij ertoe bijgedragen dat velen ophielden met zoeken naar de grote god zij bralden over de prediking van christus alleen maar zij predikten hun eigen kerk hun eigen groepen en hun eigen ervaringen zendingswerkers schreven rapporten aan hun donateurs schreven brieven vol met bedrog en wishful thinking wij geloofden de realiteit niet omdat die niet correspondeerde met onze verslagen wij veroorzaakte ergernis bij de vermoeide russische bevolking waar zijn eigenlijk de miljoenen mensen die wij tot god zouden hebben geleid

2280758 an affirmative defense such as condonation may be raised by a party who fails specially to plead it where the defensible misconduct was not specifically alleged in the opposing partys complaint
2280759 but as legal precedent makes clear even had husband failed to raise condonation at all the trial court was not permitted to grant a divorce on a ground of misconduct the wife had condoned
2280760 the law does not permit courts to sever marriage bonds and to break up households merely because husband and wife through unruly tempers lack of patience and uncongenial natures live unhappily together it requires them to submit to the ordinary consequences of human infirmities and unwise selection

2280775 an appropriate monetary policy following a jump in the price of oil will allow on a temporary basis both some increase in unemployment and some increase in price inflation by pursuing actions that balance the deleterious effects of oil prices on both employment and inflation over the near term policymakers are in essence attempting to find their preferred point on the activity inflation variance tradeoff curve introduced by john taylor 30 years ago such policy actions promote the efficient adjustment of relative prices since real wages need to fall and both prices and wages adjust slowly the efficient adjustment of relative prices will tend to include a bit of additional price inflation and a bit of additional unemployment for a time leading to increases in real wages that are temporarily below the trend established by productivity gains

2280782 the everyday treasure that once belonged to her father royce h martin who died in september 2004 at age 81 he had sandcasted his name on the aluminum handle and jury rigged the latches which tended to release unexpectantly to stay shut when yost was about five years old her father started coming home from his job as a powerstation operator with a cookie or some candy for his youngest daughter in his lunchbox every evening she would greet him anxiously waiting to see what surprise he would offer from the lunchbox in the final days of martins battle with cancer he lamented that he had scant material possessions to leave to his three children at his bedside yost told him that she wanted his lunchbox she went to the garage where it had been stored among his many projects and blew the dust off and looked inside there was still a piece of waxpaper her moms handiwork lining the bottom and she brought the box to him his eyes lit up as he ran his fingers across the raised letters of his name you could tell he was proud of it the lunchbox sits on a tina yosts bookshelf as a reminder both of martins ingenuity and the knowledge that one can live a rich life without a six figure income or a big bank account

2280788 the idea of media literacy for a specific moral agenda
2280789 all political power is inherent in the people and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and are established to protect and maintain individual rights
2280790 all political power is inherent in the people government is instituted for their equal benefit security and protection
2280791 any law or restrictive covenant inconsistent with these superior rights is invalid
2280792 the court finds that the 1982 act represents an unconstitutional delegation of judicial or police power to the condominium association a private entity
2280793 it is interesting to note that the inherent power of the court to impose fines for civil contempt does not permit the court to compel the contemnor to forfeit his or her property
2280794 in any case the contempt power does not comprehend the power to deprive one of his property and convey it to another
2280795 the association is authorized to hear disputes concerning allegations that unit owners have violated the declaration bylaws or rules and regulations of the condominium the 1982 act permits the association to determine those controversies and to issue orders directing violators to pay fines finally the act empowers the association with the ability to enforce its orders by depriving a violator of his property by foreclosure in this capacity the association acts as a tribunal exercising judicial power
2280796 the mischief that could be wrought if it were constitutionally permissible for a condominium association to levy fines on and exact penalties of unit owners is dramatically illustrated by this case
2280797 the imposition of a fine is a governmental power the sovereign cannot be preempted of this power and the power cannot be delegated or exercised other than in accordance with the provisions of the constitutions of the united states and of virginia neither can a fine be imposed disguised as an assessment
2280798 homeowner citizens shall have the absolute right to vote on any changes to the terms of the original contract i e changes in rules and amendments to governing documents or fines they are expected to pay no fine shall exceed the true costs of the remedy
2280799 boards give a full true and accurate accounting in writing of all association actions
2280800 on september 25th we will celebrate the 210th anniversary of the ratification of the federal bill of rights to honor this occasion we the undersigned have ratified ten resolutions comprising a common interest development homeowner bill of rights modeled on the preamble and the amendments to the u s constitution this document is meant to inspire public confidence in the concept of the cid to ensure that this local government institution pursues benevolent goals and to prevent abuses of power any changes to california law governing cids must conform to these inviolable principles
2280801 to ensure amicable and equitable relations between homeowners and their associations this bill of rights seeks fair resolution of disputes specifies rights regarding rules and charges ensures individual autonomy and promotes oversight and voting the bill of rights uses reasonability as the touchstone for all actions and includes a state office of ombudsperson for homeowners to facilitate resolution of disputes in a manner that strengthens communities

2280818 campaign against difference and discord is the great lesson of ghadir and to practice this crucial lesson followers of islamic faiths should avoid aggression and insult to each others sanctities and provocation of sentiments over sensitive issues and as i mentioned in the message released on the occasion of hajj pilgrimage they should stage vigilance and unity to defuse the plot of the arrogance which seeks to sow religious discord and conflict between the shiite and sunnite muslims
2280819 faith and trust in god feeling a responsibility for being present in all the scenes and full vigilance against the enemies
2280820 congress is challenging the administrations strategy in iraq in favor of a better one that will effectively combat terrorism and create stability in the middle east
2280821 time and time again we voted for a strategy to redeploy troops out of iraq to leave policing the streets to iraqis and to focus our mission on anti terrorism and we wont give up

2280852 iran is a neighbor we have to deal with that
2280853 the u s is thousands of miles away from iran its our national security that will be affected
2280854 the moves may have been a way for china to show its displeasure after president bush awarded the congressional gold medal to the dalai lama

2280857 instead kmt will use it on stabilizing the society uniting the nation and restoring the image the parliament should have
2280858 if we accept the pandas that means were admitting ourselves were a local government
2280859 various signs have shown that china is very likely to sap the morale of taiwans people around the time when legislative elections take place or when a top taiwanese official makes an overseas visit
2280860 china is still continuing its efforts to turn the marshall islands around
2280861 bush wont be one who will be greatly affected by this he can go anywhere
2280862 rome is a city where everyone and everything is for sale

2280899 i told my kids that they werent going to be able to ride on the limo because i wouldnt be buying anything and since we only know a few people also parents at the school it wasnt likely theyd sell anything to anyone else either

2280904 i believe this shows a complete lack of understanding of the true problem and an ignorance beyond belief the reason why they are given this money is in fact to save taxpayers money as the cost of processing an asylum application is huge especially if there is an appeal which invariably there is
2280905 further all of the money is not provided by taxes but a proportion is paid by the home office
2280906 sorry no job here polish or other europeans have it at half the price what do we have to do go over to their country and take over gordon brown remember your english
2280907 it acts as a strong incentive for more asylum seekers to come here if they succeed they get a meal ticket for life if they fail they go home with a very handy sum of our money

2280938 the support of kerry group for the youth tour is the cornerstone for the continued development of the race
2280939 kerry group is delighted to sponsor the kerry youth tour 2008 sport should be an integral part of every young persons development and events such as the kerry youth tour which encourage and nurture participation in sport are of immense importance much credit must go to the event organisers who invest their time effort and care in ensuring the tour remains a most successful event year on year the opportunity for young irish cyclists to test themselves against a strong international contingent in a professionally managed stage race such as the youth tour is of huge benefit both in experience and confidence terms i have no doubt but that this years tour will be a memorable one both from a competitor and spectator point of view
2280940 kerry group is delighted to be associated with a community based project which also has a huge international profile additionally the fact that it is a youth based event fits very well with kerrys core values and ethos
2280941 the entry for 2008 will at least equal the entry of 2007 the kerry youth tour is unique opportunity in britain and ireland for youth riders to experience the thrill of big bunch riding

2280948 we will ask that you blog for 50 for the first month while we ascertain the value and advertising potential of the blog after that month we will likely need to restructure the network theres a reason it wasnt making any money redo the pay structure and even let some bloggers go but if you let us we will turn the network around and make it profitable we are fully committed to doing whats fair and in many ways being more than just fair
2280949 now it sounds like these guys are basically saying if you can put together a half dozen blogs that are all doing mid sized 150k pages month traffic you have something worth buying
2280950 but lets break this down real quick 1mm pageviews per month gives you 2mm high value impressions ie above the fold right now bloggers are lucky to be making 50c unit so thats 1000 month 1k month split amongst six blogs thats nothing
2280951 the reality is that small and medium blogs that have real value great content solid writers and an engaged community will always always always make more money from sponsorships than cpm based ads
2280952 the long and short is that grabbing a half dozen or even a few dozen blogs together wont net you cpms of more than 4 5 and even 5mm pageviews month only really nets the whole network 5k month
2280953 blogging included know nothing about selling advertising not only do they lack the resources to mount a dedicated ad sales effort they dont know what brand advertisers are looking for they dont speak the lingo and they dont have valuable madison avenue relationships
2280954 to get higher cpms you need someone to sell that inventory and that is where the bottleneck is its not in inventory or even quality inventory its someone that can go to agencies go to microsoft go to disney go to p amp g go to vonage go to dell and say heres somthing of value and heres why you should pay more for it
2280955 because without a sales team youre stuck in the 1 2 cpm world or youre stuck selling sponsorships which im a huge fan of for high quality mid sized blogs
2280956 can generate before making greater commitments its difficult to overlook the fact that b5media essentially wants
2280957 to continue writing for an amount that probably wont even fill up any of their cars with a single tank of gas
2280958 a respectable wage while it determines the value of their blogs just how compelling are the economics of blogging both for the bloggers and the operators of blog networks
2280959 are allegedly the words used by gawker media owner nick denton in a staff email
2280960 in the blogosphere is just the regurgitation of commoditized news
2280961 especially in these troubled economic times its difficult to retain skilled experienced writers with uncompetitive salaries or risky revenue share arrangements
2280962 you dont need to shortchange people with a 50 buck token pass to determine the worth
2280963 the income i earn from my blogging activities is not my primary source of income
2280964 listen were tight on cash but well pay you 500 for the month to fix as many or as few cars as you want after that were happy to pay you the same as all our other mechanics get which is above market rate
2280965 we want to see how this works out well pay you 30 000 year for the first 3 years and after that well propose a pay structure that we think youll find competitive
2280966 we arent asking bloggers to do a specific amount of work
2280967 and the scraps comment was made from a blogger who felt that he should earn more than the blogs revenue
2280968 bloggers have to stop thinking of themselves as white collar creatives and more like rank and file workers after how theyre paid
2280969 some bloggers get paid per post like pieceworkers in a 19th century factory some get paid for pageviews which is even more idiotic from a workers perspective it means youre not paid for your labor except your monthly minimum but paid instead on a sort of gamble how well your product will perform when its thrown into the open marketplace
2280970 if youre blogging for someone other than yourself not as a commenter not as a personal blogger those are labors of love and dont count you deserve to be paid
2280971 why dont the airlines just automatically call me when my plane is delayed
2280972 bloggers have to stop thinking of themselves as white collar creatives and more like rank and file workers after how theyre paid
2280973 its about a garage closing where no other garages in the world are hiring
2280974 how to hire and retain employees using depression era economics
2280975 well i understand its going to take you 40 hours to produce what i need but since i can only sell your work product for 500 i can only afford to pay you 7 hour even though i know your skill probably reasonably demands a 40 hour wage
2280976 there are plenty of jobs people take for no pay to try to get some experience or an opportunity e g tv for example
2280977 come come ill do it for you youll spoil the spray nozzle later

2280981 nuestra teor a de la verdad libertad y la propia naturaleza democr tica de la rep blica constitucional son incompatibles con cualquier tipo de acci n que se proponga la conquista del estado pues su nico objetivo es la conquista de la sociedad civil o mejor dicho la conquista de la hegemon a pol tica en todos los mbitos culturales de una sociedad plural y moderna

2280986 por qu se molestan tanto en definir su rep blica expandir la idea y tratar por todos los medios los que tengan a mano como los blogs gratuitos que ofrecen compa as inform ticas americanas de llevar a cabo este proceso este nuevo proceso como aquel otro proceso de paz del que ahora ya no se quiere hablar es que les mueve un puro af n formalista y rigorista es que sus teor as son tan puras como las matem ticas

2280996 cuando se trata de elegir entre dos modos de acci n pol tica entre s incompatibles como efectivamente lo eran la ruptura y la reforma la historia y la l gica tienen demostrado que es imposible un entendimiento intelectual entre los defensores de uno u otro modelo los criterios de racionalidad y de moralidad intr nsecos a cada uno de ellos ni siquiera son intercomunicables porque falta la referencia com n a un mismo fin que proporcione el criterio de la mayor o menor adecuaci n o coherencia de los medios propuestos en el dilema entre reforma o ruptura surge pues indefectiblemente el problema de su inconmensurabilidad si se produce un consenso o pacto entre los partidarios de la reforma y los partidarios de la ruptura las bases de este pacto sobre lo inconmensurable han de ser forzosamente de naturaleza metaintelectual y meta tica por ello es tan dif cil explicarlo en t rminos racionales o morales

2280999 the interpretation is that individuals are still free to advocate products and services the key difference is that an advertiser must not falsely represent oneself as a consumer the advertiser must disclose its relationship
2281000 we are very much in favour of protecting and acting in the consumers best interests if fact we go one step further we actively promote ethical and professional word of mouth marketing practices every member of wom uk must sign up to the womma ethics code in order to be a member honesty of relationship opinion and identity are the key to what we believe and how we behave it is this focus upon ethical practice that helped the word of mouth marketing business grow to be worth 1 3bn in the us in 2007 as an organisation were behind this regulation

2281026 because i saw him sweet heart because i held him in my arms because he had a dark skin like your daddy

2281034 all that running and running and running and running and what was i chasing it wasnt even real
2281035 measured the responses of over 140 companies including fortune 100 organizations which have created and maintain online communities today
2281036 a majority of the communities have fewer than 500 active members
2281037 and thus ive found that these numbers typically get exaggerated which does not bode well here since the reported numbers are already unimpressive
2281038 communities can extend the edge of the corporation in truly transformative ways tapping into new talent helping design products and services providing customer support and most importantly building the brand with the customer
2281039 the survey data points to some growing pains but companies are starting to see that online communities should be nurtured and leveraged for real business gain
2281040 have seen an increase in word of mouth for their brands
2281041 for one of proctor amp gambles most recognized brands proctor amp gamble has a market capitalization of just under 200bn and generated over 76bn in revenues in 2007
2281042 community probably isnt needed because unofficial ones already exist in abundance
2281043 the survey reveals that there are several disparities between companies goals how to measure success and appropriate investment the companies that commit the dedicated talent and resources to driving customer centric communities will be the winners
2281044 at the upcoming web 2 0 expo in new york
2281045 well share the results of a new industry study of 150 companies who are successfully using communities
2281046 despite the fact that the numbers demonstrate quite conclusively that the majority of the companies surveyed
2281047 as credible on face value alone no matter how prominent and
2281048 its source because sadly it seems today that so many are willing to cast aside their reputations to support the vested interests of partners collaborators etc
2281049 have not yet harnessed the true potential of these communities
2281050 have seen an increase in word of mouth for their brands
2281051 helping companies increase customer loyalty and bring outside ideas into the organization faster
2281052 more than 50 of the respondents have been at it for less than a year and it is therefore too premature to conclude that they succeeded or failed
2281053 the company is losing money on every product it sells
2281054 49 of the companies you surveyed reported annual revenues of 10mn or higher
2281055 whether a community operator is a b2b company or a b2c company if its community has fewer than 1 000
2281056 because the average person doesnt care to regularly participate in a community about detergent
2281057 have seen an increase in word of mouth for their brands
2281058 helping companies increase customer loyalty and bring outside ideas into the organization faster
2281059 social media is a waste a companies should ignore it
2281060 whats the best way to get rid of a stain caused by red wine

2281191 see this show because it reminds us how rarely and how inaccurately we too often see each other and ourselves i thought hard about how i was looking at the strangers around me the generalizations i was making about them the lack of eye contact see this show my name is sad im 30 years old we hear this phrase repeatedly throughout this one man play in different incarnations sometimes he says hes 25 instead sometimes he follows it with phrases such as im a piece of shit i wont contest that sad is a self degrading illegal immigrant from iraq a peddler of roses a self confessed liar a lover of america he is the product of racism he knows he is inferior he knows he doesnt deserve to look an american in the eye or sit on a park bench or use a public toilet sads monologue directed straight at us jumps back and forth through repetition in spite of the lies we see greater layers of truth of who he is where he came from and where he now lives but predominantly we are left with how terribly he views himself in comparison to the beautiful fair skinned americans see this show the script written by robert schneider and translated from german by paul dvorak is rich poetic and unique christopher john domig is captivating highly skilled and utterly heartbreaking as sad david robinsons direction is smart and beautiful relying heavily on contrasts the elements come together with skill and precision creating a true piece of art

2281337 niet ingaan op dit geseur bij de laatste brief van reve in dit boek p 294 verhelderend en prettig leesbaar aan het eind van elke brief zijn de toelichtende noten van willem otterspeer en nop maas de titel die gekozen is voor de briefwisseling is te vinden op pagina 83 aan het slot van de brief van willem frederik hermans van 16 augustus 1951 waar geschreven staat geert van oorschot is een man die ik hogelijk zou waarderen liefhebben in vertrouwen nemen enz wanneer ik er zeker van was dat zijn kleine fouten geen grote fouten verborgen wanneer hij mij niet alleen door zijn boersheid maar ook door de manier waarop hij herhaaldelijk beweert altijd het beste met de mensheid en zijn auteurs voor te hebben niet zo sterk aan mijn vader herinnerde verscheur deze brief werp hem in een van de 47 haarden ik vertel veel te veel
2281338 de avonden heb ik gistermiddag achter elkaar uitgelezen ik feliciteer je ermee het boek is buitengewoon eentonig maar ik heb mij geen ogenblik verveeld het einde is werkelijk een soort apotheose
2281339 het moet mij van het hart dat ik van de positieve beginselen waar het prospectus van de bezige bij van spreekt weinig merk het is een geringe troost als god alles ziet en geen vinger uitsteekt daar maak ik echter geen bezwaren tegen w l geloof ik dat het boek aan aannemelijkheid zo je wilt aan compleetheid aan menselijkheid had kunnen winnen wanneer de hoofdpersoon pogingen had gedaan desnoods alleen theoretische pogingen aan dit milieu te ontvluchten
2281340 ik heb besloten je te schrijven omdat ik je mijn grote voldoening wens te kennen te geven over je novellenbundel moedwil en misverstand die ik enige dagen geleden kocht
2281341 de opmerkingen die je over moedwil enz maakt hebben mij meer plezier gedaan dan alles wat de pers erover moge schrijven
2281342 jij hebt iets wat ik bepaald mis beweeglijkheid van verteltrant en gedurfde maar altijd rake vergelijking daardoor houdt mijn werk tegenover het jouwe altijd iets traags vlaks en effens een schemerig relaas dat voornamelijk op stemming berust
2281343 welnu ik ben 12 october ondertrouwd een alleronsmakelijkste procedure waarbij ik per vergissing de zaal verliet zonder getekend te hebben zodat ik moest worden teruggeroepen is dat een freudiaan p 21
2281344 in ieder geval meende ik dat jij in je werk nooit anders dan de ondergang tot onderwerp hebt gekozen
2281345 is het niet zo dat men in het ondergaande het ontbindende en hopeloos strijdende veel gemakkelijker de waarheid kan ontdekken dan in het bloeiende zich samenvoegende en groeiende het ontbindende is rijker aan beelden grootser en gecompliceerder en vooral ontroerender terwijl de schoonheid van het in opkomst zijnde is als waterverfpleistering onduidelijk oninteressant plat lawaaierig
2281346 ik interesseer mij niet zozeer voor de ondergang van de westerse beschaving als wel voor de opgang of verwachting van opgang waar ondergang op volgt p 33

2281387 its not what was seen but what was felt you may remember that inmates of a boot camp mostly black and hispanic street kids who have committed non violent crimes were sent to nashota to fight against the river they expected to be called the usual ugly names but found a friendly people all endangered but all helping one another the inmates pitched in filled sandbags and tried to strengthen the levee for days and nights without sleep and they learned how to smile because as they said were saving lives were gonna save the town on the last night the women who had grown fond of the street kids made supper for them at the church but they wouldnt eat because they didnt save the town later back at the boot camp the inmates were trying to hide their tears over a card with a picture of roses and signed by their new friends with the message with warmest thanks to each of you from your nashota family youll never be forgotten gods grace extended

2281393 for me experiential programs involve asking people to experience something and make meaning out of it
2281394 the meaning is co created with the other people in the room
2281395 i might absorb information from a lecture but i dont necessarily internalize it
2281396 experiential learning is far more effective than the traditional type of learning programs
2281397 what they offer is way different but so much more meaningful and effective
2281398 my primary concern was that the organization was not ready for this experience
2281399 the organization needs to take a long term focus and build into the post learning process a way to revisit it
2281400 some of our employees have hung nooses from their african american coworkers lockers we need help
2281401 a lifetime of mental constructs led these people to put nooses on their black colleagues lockers and youre going to give it one hour
2281402 business and government persist in applying inadequate thinking and methods to solving problems one reason they do that is because it is possible in fact easy to tame a wicked problem to do so you simply construct a problem definition that obscures the wicked nature of the problem and then apply linear methods to solving it this sets off a chain reaction that perpetuates the problem

2281407 de uitgangspunten voor het vosp die voortdurend werden gemonitord aan de hand van de aanbiedingsbrief van de marktpartijen d d 26 september 2007 zijn laatstelijk bevestigd in het projectgroep overleg van 18 februari 2008 nota bene deze uitgangspunten waren tevens de basis voor de financi le onderhandelingsgroep om te komen tot een definitieve grondexploitatie overeenkomst de resultaten van het vosp zijn op initiatief van de gemeente op 18 februari 2008 gepresenteerd op een interactieve bewoners informatieavond
2281408 sinds eind januari 2008 bij de gemeente wijzigingen in de ambtelijke bezetting hebben plaatsgevonden lees hier een nieuw hoofd van vrom heeft de gemeente de gemaakte vergaderafspraken verdaagd de spelregels gewijzigd en de uitgangspunten eenzijdig aangepast in het laatste stuurgroepoverleg van 21 mei 2008 is op de vraag van de marktpartijen of de concept uitgangspuntennotitie zevender thiedenland ii structureel afweek van de gemeenschappelijk genomen uitgangspunten door u geantwoord dat deze marginaal afweken maar nu blijkt worden in de door u aan ons ter beschikking gestelde concept uitgangspuntennotitie de te realiseren woningaantal met maar liefst 20 procent verminderd
2281409 de marktpartijen hebben zich koste nog moeite gespaard om met de ook door u zo gewenste bebouwing uiterlijk begin 2009 te kunnen maken starten dit op basis van een neutrale grondexploitatie balans gezien de nzijdig aanpassingen van uitgangspunten door de gemeente onstaat een beduidende negatieve balans in de grondexploitatie opzet waardoor realisatie en start van de bouwactiviteiten niet meer haalbaar is wij zien vooralsnog dan ook af van een verdere opdracht gevers rol richting derden en nemen afstand van de eerder gedane aanbieding

2281428 de vergissingen die hitler heeft gemaakt hebben de personen wier dood hij heeft veroorzaakt geen schade berokkend de zielen werden van hun aardse banden bevrijd als vlinders die hun cocon verlaten de mensen die zijn achtergebleven treuren over hun doden alleen omdat ze niet weten in wat voor vreugde die zielen zijn opgenomen

2281431 hitler vermocht niets zonder de samenwerking steun en willige onderwerping van miljoenen mensen
2281432 hitler greep de omstandigheden aan maar hij cre erde ze niet
2281433 de horror van de hitler ervaring was niet dat hij die aan de mensheid oplegde maar dat de mensheid hem liet begaan de verbazing is niet dat er een hitler was maar dat zovelen hem volgden de schande is niet alleen dat hitler miljoenen joden vermoordde maar ook dat miljoenen joden vermoord moesten worden voordat hitler werd tegengehouden
2281434 het doel van de hitler ervaring was de mensheid haar ware gezicht te tonen
2281435 een volk uitroeien een volk uitroeien is of het nu in ausschwitz of in wounded knee gebeurt
2281436 hitler is jullie niet gezonden hij is door jullie gecre erd dat is de les het bewustzijn van scheiding segregatie superioriteit van wij tegen zij van ons en hen is wat de hitler ervaring schept
2281437 hitler dacht dat hij iets goeds deed voor zijn volk en zijn volk dacht dat ook dat was de waanzin ervan het grootste deel van de natie was het met hem eens
2281438 als je een of ander waanzinnig idee verkondigt en tien miljoen mensen zijn het met je eens dan geloof je niet meteen dat je waanzinnig bent

2281451 wij vinden het noodzakelijk dat er in nederland de ruimte blijft bestaan om kritiek te uiten op geert wilders zeker in het huidige politieke klimaat waarin hij wekelijks haat kan zaaien tegen een hele bevolkingsgroep wij zijn dan ook niet van plan om ons hierdoor te laten afhouden van het verspreiden van onze poster
2281452 ik wist destijds niet m r over reve dan wat mij via de pers onder ogen kwam
2281453 natuurlijk had ik wel de avonden gelezen want ik ben mijn hele leven al ge nteresseerd geweest in taal maar ik vond zijn werk erg moeilijk op de een of andere manier intrigeerde het me echter wel en ik denk dat het d t is wat mij heeft doen besluiten om ja te zeggen op de vraag van guus of ik hem wilde helpen met het ordenen van al dat archiefmateriaal
2281454 reve zelf vond het maar oude troep en hij leek niets te geven om alles wat er over hem was verschenen guus vond het echter van belang dat het bewaard werd ik weet nog dat al die dozen bij mij in huis stonden het waren er gigantisch veel
2281455 ik vroeg me echt af hoe ik dit aan moest gaan pakken toen heb ik mijn verstand maar op nul gezet en ben met de bovenste doos begonnen jaartal bij jaartal gelegd de fotos bij elkaar sommige artikelen waren gewoon uit de krant gescheurd en zonder datum vooral de fotos vond ik vaak bijzonder gerard stond er altijd trots en uitdagend op nu denkt men misschien het zijn maar fotos maar als je het in de tijd van toen plaatst was de persoon reve toch heel opmerkelijk
2281456 het was natuurlijk wel ontzettend leuk om te doen en op die manier leerde ik gerard ook een beetje kennen ik denk echter wel dat als ik het nu zou doen ik me er meer in zou verdiepen toen was ik natuurlijk toch nog erg jong
2281457 oh die hele woning was zeer boeiend het stond vol met heiligenbeelden ik vroeg aan gerard wat hij daar toch mee moest en hij antwoordde een inbreker neemt ze tenminste niet mee want ze zijn veel te zwaar typisch een antwoord van gerard
2281458 nu heeft dit archief best wel weer de aandacht maar toen heeft het vrij lang geduurd voordat de beslissing viel om het daadwerkelijk te kopen iedereen vond het stiekem een beetje te veel gedoe maar durfde dit niet uit te spreken ik stelde mij toen op als warm pleitbezorger voor de aankoop ik had echter nooit aan collegas verteld dat ik er een speciale binding mee had want je moet als gemeenteraadslid kijken naar het algemeen belang maar ik dacht gerard reve is een van de belangrijkste nederlandse schrijvers onze volksschrijver daar moet je iets mee doen uiteindelijk is het archief door de gemeente aangekocht en daar ben ik blij om want ik heb aan de opzet nog mijn steentje bijgedragen ook al is het al vijfendertig jaar geleden
2281459 jazeker sowieso zijn de medewerkers van het gemeentearchief er regelmatig mee in de weer daarbij is er al enkele malen een reve cursus georganiseerd waarbij onder leiding van herman van horen en jan willard archiefbeelden werden getoond en men gedichten en stukken uit verhalen las maar dat niet alleen het archief bevat bijvoorbeeld naast eerste drukken van de avonden ook reves kroontjespennen en tegeltjes met door de schrijver geschreven teksten erop die in de cursus onder de aandacht werden gebracht
2281460 gerard reve woonde op de nieuwe markt en liep in eerste instantie altijd binnen bij een collega boekhandel omdat die meer op zijn wandelroute lag
2281461 maar toen hij op een dag bij ons binnenliep voor zijn dagelijkse krantje is hij niet meer weg gegaan tja een bekend schrijver kan ik natuurlijk niet laten lopen
2281462 dan maakte hij zich van te voren zorgen over de reacties wat overigens nooit nodig bleek de lezers die naar zon signeersessie toe kwamen waren veelal niet weertenaren mensen uit weert hadden zeker toen vaak de instelling doe maar gewoon dan doe je al gek genoeg ze keken eerst liever de kat uit de boom reve heeft eigenlijk niet lang genoeg in weert gewoond om de mensen echt aan hem te kunnen laten wennen
2281463 soms liep hij de zaak binnen en voeg of hij s avonds een wijntje kon komen drinken een keer vroeg hij zelfs of hij zijn nieuwe verloofde mocht meenemen
2281464 het waren altijd heel interessante avonden reve deed het vaak voorkomen dat hij niets las maar hij wist alles en had alles gelezen hij was een groot verhalenverteller en op zulke avonden presenteerde hij zich als iemand die graag sprak over het leven godsdienst politiek en cultuur maar het gezelschap bepaalde wie hij was
2281465 maar hij zocht natuurlijk wel een passage uit waardoor er heel wat rode oortjes ontstonden na afloop bleef echter wel iedereen nog uren om na te praten daar genoot hij ontzettend van
2281466 wellicht dat hij ietwat eenzelviger werd maar dat was misschien ook wel gebeurd als hij niet in weert had gewoond hij was een zeer sobere en eenvoudige man hij had een tot mobiele werkruimte omgebouwde citro nbus waarmee hij naar de ijzeren man reed om daar te schrijven maar ook parkeerde hij die werkruimte voor zijn voordeur om daar te schrijven en dat diende uiteraard ook nog een ander doel zo kon hij beter de schooljongens bekijken
2281467 reve schreef alles met kroontjespen die hij gewoon afveegde aan zijn kleren zelf vond hij dat geen probleem anderen wel die inktlappen vond ik voor hem en enkele weken later ontving ik een dankbrief
2281468 maar hij was niet alleen hij had zijn huisgenoot meegenomen deze stelde zich voor als gerard reve maar zelf had ik nog nooit van hem gehoord
2281469 in 1966 deed ik met reves gedicht op mijn ouderdom mee aan een culturele wedstrijd van de katholieke plattelands jeugd in nieuwkuyk
2281470 waarom weet ik niet maar alles over reve fascineerde mij ik denk dat het zijn schrijfstijl was die mij aanzette tot het voordragen van dit gedicht ik werd aangenaam verrast met alle prijzen die ik ermee won het gaf mij de kracht om vele gedichten van reve uit mijn hoofd te leren niet wetende wat mij te wachten stond in mijn verdere leven
2281471 ik voelde me op mijn gemak en ik durfde het betreffende gedicht voor te dragen
2281472 reve wist niet wat hij hoorde vanaf dat moment was onze vriendschap geboren mijn partner gerard en ik hebben dan ook mooie herinneringen aan reves weerter periode
2281473 we hebben heel wat belevenissen gedeeld reve hield ervan om te shockeren
2281474 zo waren we eens bij hem op bezoek nadat hij zich al een week of drie vier had stilgehouden hij was somber enkele dagen later moest hij een lezing geven in kortrijk maar er waren pas vier plaatsen verkocht hij wist als ik aandacht wil moet ik mensen op stang jagen reve was streng katholiek dus ik zei tegen hem gerard als jij rondbazuint dat je van je geloof af bent gevallen dan krijg jij alle aandacht die je wilt voor zon leugentje om bestwil was hij wel in kort daarna werd het bekend in de media en enkele dagen later zat die zaal in kortrijk bomvol
2281475 naast het schrijven en het schrijversschap had hij een heel andere persoonlijkheid
2281476 iets dat je niet zag als je hem niet kende hij had bijvoorbeeld twee rechterhanden en aan technisch inzicht ontbrak het hem niet hij hield ervan te shockeren maar was tevens vriendelijk van aard en niet te vergeten was hij ontzettend zuinig als we bij hem gingen eten stuurde hij ons met een lege pan naar de chinees om de hoek om die daar voor zeven gulden vijftig te laten vullen met nasi hij had als het ware verschillende persoonlijkheden en het zijn die verschillende kanten van hem die we in de loop der jaren steeds meer zijn gaan waarderen
2281477 we hebben het nog regelmatig over hem en in huis staan nog enkele herinneringen zoals vele gebruikte kroontjespennen die we van hem meekregen toen hij uit weert vertrok we kunnen er niets mee maar op deze manier blijft reve wel in onze herinneringen voortleven
2281478 i think fewer women are getting hired in the first place and i dont think it has to do with the portfolios its a case of like hiring like odds are stacked against women because there are fewer women doing the hiring
2281479 people are compartmentalized and then foster and create like minded people

2281528 twee van de belangrijkste nederlandse schrijvers van de twintigste eeuw willem frederik hermans en gerard reve schreven elkaar in de jaren veertig en vijftigvele openhartige brieven

2281530 er schijnt niemand van ongeveer mijn gehalte te zijn die nog produceert van hermans wordt al 1 1 2 of 2 jaar een roman aangekondigd maar ik zie nergens iets ervan ook geen voorpublikaatsies louis paul boon schrijft niet meer maar schildert nu richard minne is dood jan van nijlen is dood pierre kemp is dood het holle vat mulisch is van eigen verbeelding gebarsten wolkers absoluut ongenietbaar geworden

2281535 to what extent may proxies be utilized for voting or other decision making purposes by a michigan nonprofit corporation
2281536 the act provides that if so provided in the corporations articles such action may be taken by the written consent of a majority of shareholders or members entitled to vote if such is promptly noticed to all shareholders or members not consenting this notice is not required if all shareholders or members have consented to the action in writing
2281537 the answer to the question as to the use of proxies in actions by shareholders of a stock nonprofit corporation or a membership nonstock nonprofit corporation in michigan is yes they may be used within the parameters of the act
2281538 it must be concluded that if the michigan legislature intended directors of a nonprofit directorship corporation to have the authority to grant proxies the act would have so provided
2281539 sec 441 voting generally 1 each outstanding share or member is entitled to 1 vote on each matter submitted to a vote unless otherwise provided pursuant to section 303 or 304 a vote may be cast either orally or in writing unless otherwise provided in the bylaws

2281547 what in the world should i do with all of these engagement pictures
2281548 ik zeg niet dat ik het nooit meer doe maar er komt wel heel veel bij kijken pas nu kan ik echt met recht zeggen dat ik zeer veel bewondering heb voor mensen die dit dagelijks doen
2281549 het was een hels karwei maar wel een leuk hels karwei
2281550 je hebt natuurlijk bij zon expositie met verschillende kunstenaars van doen en moet daarbij tevens rekening houden met de structuur van het kunstcollege als je dan ook nog de organisatie van de opening erbij optelt en het vervaardigen van de cd rom die iedere bezoeker ontvangt dan ben je uren in de weer maar het resultaat mag er zijn niet
2281551 maar ik vond het ook belangrijk enkele gastexposanten enthousiast te krijgen voor dit project er zijn namelijk enkele zeer talentvolle jonge mensen die op de een of andere manier aan weert zijn verbonden en in de kunstwereld flink aan de weg timmeren
2281552 de opzet was om ook jonge kunstenaars hun werk te laten tonen
2281553 misschien kwam dit wel doordat hij zelf alles vaak op een symbolische manier zag
2281554 en we hebben het natuurlijk over gerard reve wiens leven in het teken leek te staan van dubbelzinnigheid kijk maar naar zijn geloof hij nam het op de hak maar was er tevens heel serieus mee bezig was
2281555 wat mij nou zo aantrekt is dat zijn werk van alle tijden is
2281556 een stukje recente geschiedenis dat zijn uitstraling heeft naar het weerter cultuurgebied
2281557 ik zag kortgeleden zijn toenmalige appartement aan de nieuwe markt te koop staan het is zonde dat weert het bestaande potentieel niet beter benut
2281558 zou het niet schitterend zijn als weert dit pand aankocht de stad is cultureel gezien doorspekt van carnaval kermis en vlaai maar als gemeente heeft het zo veel m r te bieden persoonlijk vind ik dat een gemeente met een actief cultuurbeleid deze kans niet kan laten schieten
2281559 dat overleg was vruchtbaar er werden alle mogelijke idee n gespuid maar ik heb er daarna nooit meer iets van gehoord men laat het gewoon liggen en je zult zien dat dit met het appartement nu weer gebeurt
2281560 in de wandelgangen van de dependance van het bisschoppelijk college deden allerlei verhalen de ronde over die grote schrijver die zich tegenover de school had gevestigd
2281561 dat intrigeerde iedereen enorm want er gebeurde eindelijk eens wat in weert
2281562 maar daar kwam ik destijds niet doorheen zware kost voor jonge mensen goed voorbereid op het interview was ik dus niet maar toch werd het een prettig gesprek al was veel van wat reve zei van een abstractieniveau dat ik toen nog niet begreep dat allereerste interview heeft echter wel een basis gelegd voor ons verdere contact
2281563 hij zag het belang in van een goede presentatie en op de keper heeft daarin destijds een mooie rol gespeeld
2281564 zo kregen we destijds vanuit rome bisschop gijsen toegewezen dat was natuurlijk nieuws van het eerste uur hoewel reve bijna dagelijks in de martinuskerk kwam om te bidden bij het maria altaar vond hij al dat gedoe om die bisschop maar niets op de keper schreef er een scherp artikel over uitspraken werden landelijk geciteerd en dat ietwat shockerende vond hij fantastisch zijn toewijding aan die krant ontstond geleidelijk maar bleek sterk het omgaan en werken met reve had een eigen dynamiek en dat was geweldig om mee te maken
2281565 toen ik bezig was met koninklijke jaren miste ik wel reve zijn mening helaas was hij toen al te slecht van gezondheid om zijn medewerking te verlenen

2281569 de dode hond en ter plaatse gepicknicked 26 juli 2007 bovenstaande foto ondersteunt de inhoud van de colom van joop de keijzer in de stad amersfoort van 25 juli lees de colum betaalautomaat zondagmorgen kwart over acht word ik gebeld ochtendhumeur en ik heb nog geen zin om te fluiten door een meneer die met zijn bootje in de eemhaven ligt en vraagt of ik even kan komen want de automaat op de haven geeft geen geld terug hoewel hij wel borg heeft betaald en nu dat bedrag terug wil ik leg ook hem maar weer uit dat ik hem niet kan helpen want de havenmeesters hebben de sleutel om bij storingen dit apparaat dat bijna 200 000 heeft gekost voor de zoveelste keer weer na te kijken toevallig heb ik in het brugwachtershuisje een fooienpotje dus schiet ik het bedrag even voor zodat deze meneer gelijk met de fietsboot kan vertrekken maar eigenlijk is het toch een absurde situatie dat ik als brugwachter iemand een tientje borg terug ga betalen omdat een automaat die een vermogen heeft gekost nog steeds niet goed werkt ook de havenmeesters komen elke keer als ik ze bel geduldig en trouw opdraven om de automaat weer open te maken de recreanten hun geld terug te geven de storing te verhelpen en het apparaat weer te sluiten u leest het goed het apparaat openmaken en de mensen hun geld contant weer terug te geven en dan niet n keer per dag maar soms wel vier vijf maal per dag naar gelang het aantal mensen dat wil vertrekken deze ambtenaren doen dit overigens zonder enige compensatie voor die zondagen ik draai samen met twee collegas zeven dagen in de week van 09 00 uur tot 20 00 uur doe de brug open geef de mensen een tasje met informatie wens ze een fijne dag in onze schitterende haven wijs ze op de liggeld betaalautomaat en ga nog fluitend naar huis maar ik krijg er nu een taak bij om de mensen uit te leggen dat ze de havenmeester moeten bellen maar omdat op zondag het telefoonnummer niet bereikbaar is ga ik voor de bootrecreanten de havenmeester van dienst maar bellen op zijn priv nummer wie heeft in hemelsnaam besloten dat er zon onding moet komen dat nog lang niet goed functioneert en waarin elke keer weer nieuwe storingen en kinderziektes opduiken de haven wordt nu hij bijna klaar is steeds drukker en de mensen zijn heel enthousiast maar worden nijdig als de techniek hen in de kou laat staan ook zijn er recreanten die geen pinpas hebben dus hoe komen die dan aan stroom en water en ook kunnen ze dan hun vuil niet kwijt en omdat ze geen sepkaart hebben kunnen ze ook niet de deur van de douchegelegenheid openen vooral de oudere generatie stelt het persoonlijke contact nog steeds meer op prijs dan zon koud wonder van techniek ook de afvalbakken gaan niet altijd open dus zetten de mensen hun vuil er maar naast of gooien het in de bak van de bewoners die daar op hun beurt weer wat van gaan zeggen meneer de brugwachter kan ik niet gewoon een paar euro in de automaat gooien voor wat stroom en water

2281580 when it is more important to be seen than to be talented it is hardly surprising that the less gifted among us are willing to fart our way into the spotlight
2281581 without any meaningful standard by which to measure our worth we turn to the public eye for affirmation
2281582 whenever young people are allowed to indulge in something old people are not allowed to it makes us bitter what did we have the mall and the parking lot of the 7 eleven it sucked to grow up when we did and were mad about it now
2281583 you didnt behave like that because nobody gave you the option

2281585 there may be programs we like to watch together and this is good
2281586 but there is a concern that a television that is always on interferes with how we communicate
2281587 were creating environments where people can get together and work as if they were in the same place
2281588 theres only so much you can do in a video only meeting

2281591 were creating environments where people can get together and work as if they were in the same place
2281592 i think the thing people find most pleasantly surprising is the ability to really feel like there are other people in this world with you and to interact with them instead of just talking to a black hole
2281593 when you can have a persistent team space and come together there at a prearranged time or visit opportunistically and notice someones there and then talk to them thats kind of fun
2281594 theres a lot going on in this area and only a very small percentage of the market has been penetrated

2281610 there are five environments you can live in on this planet theres the city the desert the mountains the plains and the beach
2281611 but you need to get out there and travel and figure out where you thrive
2281612 some places youll go to and youll feel yourself wither your brain will fog up your body wont respond to your thoughts and desires and youll feel sad and angry
2281613 you need to find out which of the five environments are yours if you belong by the ocean then the mountains will ruin you if youre suited for the blue solitude of the plains then the city will be a tight roaring prison cell thatll eat you alive
2281614 man you got your leg machine gunned in vietnam you never went to therapy humphrey bogart never went to therapy

2281620 was formed specifically to change the communitys perception of what a law firm can and should do for its clients how do we do this by providing an attentiveness to each clients specific legal issues while simultaneously employing technology used by much larger firms to keep costs to a minimum we also go one step further than simply boasting of personalized attention without backing up our claim each one our clients receives secure access to our website giving them the ability to view the status of their matter at the time thats most convenient for them why do all of this simply put because every day we do our vest best to change the way law is practiced for the better
2281621 for the growth and influence of user generated content on the internet the magazine said naming a collectivity rather than the individual reflected the way the internet was shifting the balance of helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world but also change the way the world changes
2281622 about my state of mind or the state of the union or the steak fries at the new eatery down the street

2281625 heres a riddle when is a croquet mallet like a billy club ill tell you whenever you want it to be
2281626 you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry therefore im mad
2281627 heres a riddle when is a croquet mallet like a billy club ill tell you whenever you want it to be

2281629 when i go to the pharmacy i see that the bottles are in english and i want to know what it says on the bottles
2281630 so many times i leave the pharmacy without knowing what it is saying thats scary for me
2281631 maybe i have to give him this much medicine sometimes i have to give less
2281632 sometimes i wont even give it to my son because i wont know how to do it
2281633 giving new yorkers access to the information they need starts with simple common sense steps like providing translation services and extra medical instruction for those with limited english proficiency who are filling prescriptions
2281634 our proposed legislation will help break down the barriers many currently face when seeking health care and ensure that no new yorker is left guessing when it comes to questions about their medication
2281635 although i appreciate the efforts already taken by a number of pharmacies to help their customers read their prescription label in a more familiar language these businesses still have more work to do
2281636 people should not have to guess how to administer their medicine just because they cant read the directions clearly the consequences can be devastating the translate of drug labels by pharmacies is not only a good idea it is the right thing to do
2281637 i guess there has been spotty results there has not been a whole chain setting out clear guidelines
2281638 were still looking for that kind of sweeping solution not only in bushwick and in woodside
2281639 what about a pharmacy that is in certain area of new york city when youve got spanish and russian
2281640 what do you do in a case like that are you going to have a separate pharmacist for each one
2281641 running away with a world of thoughts gave me my own ideas
2281642 literature has enriched my life career ambition sense of enquiry and provided guidance on ethics it has fed my ambition seeded my imagination provided me with discipline and propelled me forward like a car accelerating
2281643 even when the subject matter of a literary work is painful or its method a challenging rough magic ones own life can be transformed by the experience

2281682 i learned that lesson for the first time in those first few moments i switched from being student at my desk to a student lying on the floor playing dead wondering whether i would ever make it out of that room in norris hall alive because that morning as the smell of gun residue and blood penetrated my nostrils and blood seeped through my jeans and three bullets entered into my body hope seemed far away because he left the room but came back in he would run out of bullets but then he would reload
2281683 evil was standing there embodied in this person standing four feet away from me then it came hope found its way into that room
2281684 i realized that i wasnt paralyzed and that my nerves still reached my foot despite the three bullets that had just entered my left side

2281733 i have been producing dance music for more than 11 years now and i seem to have spent months on end locked in my studio mixing and remixing these new tracks we decided to appoint wolfstar to help with the word of mouth campaign as we have noticed a major shift in the way people acquire and use their music the team at wolfstar certainly have a big passion for dance music and a couple of their team have even already worked in the industry they also demonstrated a much deeper level of understanding of how social media and word of mouth campaigns work i am really looking forward to launching my new website and interacting with my fans on a whole new level
2281734 when wolfstar was launched just over a year ago we said we wanted to ensure that our client base was as exciting and as diverse as possible so for us to be working with a high calibre dance music producer like chris lake and his record label is truly fantastic i earned some extra cash as a club promoter during my university days but to be working within the music industry on a strategic level is very exciting indeed both for me and the rest of the team we hope that this will be the first of many clients from the music industry

2282411 kijk dat de surinamer die in armoede in paramaribo zit naar amsterdam probeert te komen omdat hij daar een betrekkelijke welvaart vindt dat kan geen zinnig mens hem kwalijk nemen maar dat de nederlandse overheid in een eivolle stad waar geen werk en geen woonruimte zijn tienduizenden immigranten binnenhaalt dat is misdadig en dat noem ik racisme het is mensenliefde en gelijkheid en broederschap die niets kosten amsterdam kende vrijwel geen racisme maar de regering den uyl heeft het weten te planten de massa denkt niet logisch als een nederlander als 7 1 2 jaar op een wachtlijst voor woonruimte staat en hij ziet surinamers een paar weken na hun aankomst ongestraft woonruimte bezetten dan richt zijn woede zich niet tegen want die blijven buiten schot maar tegen die surinamers als je je schuldig voelt stuur dan geld naar suriname maar haal die troep niet naar amsterdam
2282412 maar hoe extreem gemakkelijk de strijd tegen racisme ook is toch is die strijd al zon twintig jaar een totale mislukking ondanks het enorme aantal intellectuelen dat ervoor op de been is gebracht zon mislukking kan verbazing wekken totdat je beseft mij heeft dat jaren gekost dat het ware doel niet het bestrijden van racisme is maar het cre ren van een nieuw soort racisme het is pijnlijk om te zeggen en moeilijk om te geloven maar het is waar op basis van een grotendeels gefantaseerde negeridentiteit probeert frans moreel links eigenlijk een antiblank racisme in europa door de voeren omdat dat net zo weinig gerechtvaardigd is als het omgekeerde racisme blijkt de bevolking uiteraard moeilijk op de been te brengen

2282444 de meeste australi rs geloven in god dit is geen rechtse radicale politieke praat maar een vaststaand feit omdat christelijke mannen en vrouwen deze natie gesticht hebben gefundeerd op christelijke principes en dit is duidelijk gedocumenteerd en het is zeer zeker gepast om dit feit te tonen op de muren van onze scholen als god u beledigt dan stel ik voor dat u overweegt om een ander deel van de wereld uw thuis te noemen want god maakt deel uit van onze cultuur
2282445 wij aanvaarden jullie geloof en zullen ons niet afvragen waarom het enige dat we van jullie vragen is dat jullie ons geloof accepteren en vredig en harmonieus met ons willen samenleven

2282664 when people leave a tip they expect it to go to service staff and as consumers weve got a right to know if that actually happens
2282665 this is an issue of fairness and common sense and its one many people clearly care a lot about the changes were proposing will mean that in the future tips cannot count towards payment of the minimum wage

2282739 torno a londra per la terza volta ogni volta un corso sostanzialmente uguale ma profondamente diverso intenso pieno di emozioni da vivere a cuore aperto
2282740 e la mente che crea il bene dal male che rende miserabile o felice ricco o povero
2282741 il mio successo dipende solo da me e dalle decisioni che prendo
2282742 che tu creda di farcela o di non farcela avrai comunque ragione
2282743 perch osservi la pagliuzza che nellocchio di tuo fratello e non scorgi la trave che nellocchio tuo e come puoi dire al tuo fratello fratello permetti che io ti levi la pagliuzza che nellocchio non vedendo la trave che hai nel tuo occhio ipocrita leva prima la trave dal tuo occhio ed allora vedrai di togliere la pagliuzza che nellocchio del tuo fratello

2282759 re settlement of college newspaper case the mark of a good settlement is that it makes everyone happy and that is certainly true in this case the college is pleased that the concerns we raised were addressed and resolved especially pleasing is the acknowledgement that oversight of the college newspaper will rest in the hands of a widely representative student media advisory board the affirmation of our long established respect for a free press paves the way for implementing technological convergences that will make the viking news a first class publication and a model for collegiate journalism we welcome the settlement and the chance it affords us to give our students a premier learning experience

2282783 the mark of a good settlement is that it makes everyone happy and that is certainly true in this case
2282784 the occ journalism settlement is a victory for the first amendment and for college journalism
2282785 journalism at ocean county college and in new jersey generally will be stronger because of this settlement
2282786 it is unfortunate that it took a lawsuit from editors of the viking news to bring about this result but it is essential that students throughout the state have full rights to freedom of speech and press
2282787 im not sure if courage was what we were thinking
2282788 we just knew it was the right thing to do simply put we felt something wrong happened and we werent going to get picked on as student journalists
2282789 shows that the courts agree that collegiate journalism certainly the news and editorial departments ought to be free of interference from administrations that use their position to control the campus media
2282790 a message that college administrations should be careful in the way they treat the campus media
2282791 it is designed to report news fairly and accurately while simultaneously teaching students the basics of journalism bosley worked for years toward this high goal
2282792 wondering and dreading what new actions and indignities would be taken against me and or my students in attempts to stifle our journalistic efforts
2282793 i cannot begin to tell you how much i admire the courage that karen bosley and her students have shown in this situation
2282794 its hard to imagine a scenario in which you work to uphold your own code of ethics your value for the first amendment only to have those you work for try every trick in the book to discourage you or force you to quit
2282795 the human and emotional toll will linger for a long time
2282796 so all that latent hostility gets to come out now eh

2282805 masa flowers that would be in the lawn and garden section
2282806 we cant refund that because you flew two legs of the trip
2282807 what do you think i did that for my health for the joy of spending my evening hours in your gate areas or perhpas for the comfort of your spacious coach seats the ambience of your friendly skies
2282808 the only reason i flew that first leg was to get to the destination which you failed to deliver me to and i flew the leg home in order at least to get to my starting point
2282809 of course that will stay forever but not when i have my own children because they want to sit on my lap as well

2282813 eu has too much wine france and italy to turn 560 million litres into fuel or disinfectant
2282814 its going to make you feel all warm and fuzzed out
2282815 i see a world where corporations such as google and yahoo continue to enrich themselves with little returning to journalistic enterprises all this ultimately at the expense of legions of professional reporters across america now out of work because their employers in old media could not afford to pay them

2282849 she let the noise of his guilt fall past her ears to the prickly pear cactus as shed asked him for the keys

2282870 vor allem christliche missionare waren in der t rkei ber jahre als geheimagenten des westens d monisiert worden
2282871 wir haben die frohe botschaft weiterzusagen und eine solche botschaft fl stert man nicht man proklamiert sie lautstark
2282872 wir verschicken jede woche hunderte b cher insgesamt werden es in diesem jahr voraussichtlich 19 000 exemplare sein
2282873 du h llst dich in licht wie in ein kleid
2282874 die 35 meter langen und 2 2 meter breiten stoffst cke vermitteln die heimelige anmutung eines zeltes
2282875 du h llst dich in licht wie in ein kleid
2282876 maar een ding kan ik jullie vertellen jezus heeft me nooit in de steek gelaten
2282877 n jaar geleden zaten we nog heerlijk met onze kev en de hele familie verschuur op tenerife
2282878 this is not about cost but about delivering information to our customers at a speed at which they can make an almost immediate trading decision
2282879 this means we can free up reporters so they have more time to think
2282880 we are sorry to hear of you bike being stolen the lock that you were using to protect your bike is a high security lock
2282881 wat een verschrikkelijk flutjaar 2005 schrap ik uit mijn agenda
2282882 guess where im at im standing on top of a crater
2282883 im going to vigorously insist that all of these contractors with the state dot be required to follow the law and some type of audit be done particularly when it appears that a large hispanic work force is involved
2282884 uhhhm last time i checked hispanics were white or are you trying to imply something else
2282885 well you cant beat statistical discrimination it may not be moral but its profitable and dead on accurate in most cases so yes majority of hispanics are illegals
2282886 so what are you gonna do about it and which assumptions hurts whom the most
2282887 south carolina is a racist state majority of the whites there support flying the confederate flag
2282888 likewise immigrants from muslim countries are much more often checked for terrorism and immigrants from former present communist countries like china are more often suspected of spying like it or not
2282889 im the son of a retired police officer a supporter of the death penalty and a proponent of deporting illegal immigrants and frankly i dont need lectures on crime and punishment i especially dont need them from those who make excuses for employers who commit the crime of knowingly hiring illegal immigrants
2282890 they know they would waste time going after a firm where everybody is named jim crow
2282891 what racial profiling are we talking about if every fifth hispanic is out of status
2282892 we hebben onze opdracht om het evangelie mee te delen aan een verloren en stervende wereld niet effectief vervuld
2282893 we houden vast aan de leer van bunyan dat is de doop op basis van geloofsbelijdenis dit is onopgeefbaar in het baptisme
2282894 ik heb veel respect voor een prediker als dr peter masters in de metropolitan tabernacle van spurgeon ik heb spurgeon en philpot hoog staan en zie hen beiden als mannen van god zij vertegenwoordigen respectievelijk de evangelische en hypercalvinistische lijn onder de baptisten beide kerken hebben echter te kampen met en algemene neergang vooral van jongere leden er is een aantrekkingskracht vanuit niet gereformeerde en charismatische kringen daarom is het vooral zaak om te kijken naar wat ons verbindt
2282895 dat aantal van n jaar is hoger dan wat in de eerste honderd jaar van de organisatie is verspreid
2282896 de schattingen zijn dat er 84 miljoen wedergeboren christenen in china zijn maar ik denk dat het aantal hoger ligt normale invoer van bijbels is niet mogelijk maar we zoeken nu naar kanalen om de bijbels daar te verspreiden
2282897 de geestelijke nood onder deze mensen is groot er zijn plannen om nog een dergelijk aantal te verspreiden in noord afrika en midden oosten leven meer dan 200 miljoen mensen die arabisch spreken
2282898 de geestelijke situatie in engeland is niet bepaald rooskleurig veel van de behoudende kerken zijn klein en tellen minder dan vijftig leden de gemeenten die wel groot zijn behoren tot de charismatische richting we vragen de kerken vooral om voor ons werk te bidden het werk van de tbs is een geloofswerk we bidden of god deuren wil openen maar ook vertalers wil geven om de bijbel op een betrouwbare wijze te vertalen
2282899 ik werd zonder geld en zonder papieren in kazachstan gedumpt
2282900 de autoriteiten zeiden dat ik het land binnen 24 uur weer moest verlaten waar kon ik anders heen dan terug naar mijn familie in turkmenistan
2282901 de aanklager probeerde allerlei feiten boven tafel te halen over christelijke samenkomsten terwijl hij terecht stond voor het illegaal oversteken van de grens
2282902 om hun dienst in gods koninkrijk ondergronds voort te zetten
2282903 die kirchen mit der erkenntnis der glaubenstaufe sind nicht mehr und nicht weniger st renfriede der einheit als alle anderen kirchen in ihren erkenntnisunterschieden auch
2282904 nach unserem verst ndnis des neuen testaments ist die taufe m ndiger menschen die ihren glauben bezeugen und getauft werden wollen die einzige form der taufe die das neue testament bezeugt
2282905 das ndert jedoch nichts an der tatsache dass wir als bund und auf der ebene der ortsgemeinden gute kontakte zu anderen christlichen kirchen pflegen und gerne mit ihnen zusammenarbeiten
2282906 die s uglingstaufe wird dabei nicht anerkannt wohl aber der gewissenskonflikt der durch die praxis der s uglingstaufe entstanden ist
2282907 dass der gewalt gegen christen in der t rkei einhalt geboten wird
2282908 als christen sind wir zutiefst davon berzeugt dass gott ein gott des friedens ist und dass wir als menschen zum friedlichen miteinader aufgerufen sind
2282909 in ihrem bem hen um verst ndigung in fragen kultureller und religi ser unterschiede
2282910 indem wir in unseren christlichen gemeinden und unserer umgebung in deutschland m glichkeiten des gespr chs zwischen t rken und deutschen moslems und christen schaffen
2282911 wir beten dass die regierenden und die verantwortlichen in den medien in der t rkei sich den radikalen islamisten machtvoll entgegenstellen und dass die moslems und moslemischen gemeinden die sich f r frieden und verst ndigung einsetzen aus diesen ereignissen gest rkt hervorgehen und gr eren einfluss gewinnen
2282912 met het geld dat we gaan inzamelen willen we kinderen in zuid afrika helpen denk aan fatsoenlijk eten en drinken scholing kleding en vooral ook aan seksuele voorlichting
2282913 kinderen in zuid afrika worden al seksueel actief als 8 of 9 jaar oud zijn
2282914 daar komen wij geregeld vrouwen tegen die in arnhem hebben gewerkt
2282915 met die god hebben wij immers zelf een relatie maar ook willen wij zo misverstanden met andere geloven voorkomen
2282916 we bieden de prostituees een luisterend oor wij geven hen aandacht en we bidden met hen we zijn er voor deze vrouwen wij proberen hen niet te bekeren en we zijn zeker niet van plan het evangelie bij hen door de strot te duwen
2282917 het liefst zou ik hen bij hun kont en kop pakken de omstandigheden waaronder zij werken zijn miserabel en het is heel akelig werk maar ik geloof in de eigen wil van de vrouw
2282918 het heeft ook geen zin je af te vragen of je als vrouw prostitutie moet accepteren een vrouw kiest ervoor dat is de realiteit ik moet er ook voor waken als ik contact met een prostituee heb dat ik haar veroordeel
2282919 ook zij proberen er het beste van te maken voor hen heb ik bewondering dat zijn sterke vrouwen
2282920 de prostituees stelden de arm om hun schouder op prijs de nederlandse vrouwen keerden vaker terug en zo ontstond de stichting het huis op de muur waarbij zich meer vrouwen van andere geloofsgemeenschappen aansloten
2282921 aan ons zal het niet liggen de vraag is of de exploitanten ons binnenlaten zij werken niet altijd mee omdat ze bang zijn dat wij de vrouwen achter het raam willen weghalen
2282922 het leek wel een kerkhof sommige teamleden moesten huilen we wisten niet waar onze prostituees waren gebleven
2282923 en als ze een keer zijn geweest komen ze ook makkelijker naar reguliere diensten
2282924 dat mensen zich thuis voelen in een kerk is een goed bijeffect niet het doel van de kerk het evangelie maakt mensen onrustig en zet ze aan het werk de uitdaging voor de bestaande kerken is om de balans te zoeken tussen de boodschap behouden en de vormen vernieuwen kom naar de themadag om je daarvoor te laten uitdagen en wees betrokken bij wat god doet in deze unieke tijd
2282925 het is goed zo maar de sleutel lever ik niet in ik blijf beschikbaar zolang er nog geen opvolger is
2282926 het pastorale heb ik altijd heel mooi gevonden aan het werk
2282927 met mensen praten over het geloof zorgen dat geloof en leven in elkaar overgaan je in de ander inleven ik wil graag een band hebben met de gemeente zodat je niet alleen van die hoi gesprekken hebt
2282928 het wordt vrijblijvender ik weet ik hoef alleen nog maar de dingen te doen die ik leuk vind
2282929 verder weet ik nog niet precies hoe de komende tijd eruit ziet
2282930 in elk geval ben ik de komende maanden veel weg om te preken in andere steden
2282931 ik hoef niet meer 24 uur per dag beschikbaar te zijn voor de kerk
2282932 we zitten in een soort overgangsfase dat gaat erover dat we gavengericht te werk gaan
2282933 dat we allemaal de dingen doen waar we goed in zijn en die we interessant vinden
2282934 veranderingen vergen tijd en het gaat niet altijd zo snel als ik zou hopen sommige ouderen hebben wat moeite met de vernieuwingen maar we hebben wel wat jonge gezinnen kunnen aantrekken
2282935 we moeten ons niet opsluiten achter muren we moeten ook buiten de kerk kijken
2282936 omdat de evangelicale theologie een helder profiel heeft en mensen antwoorden geeft op de vragen naar het vanwaar waartoe en waarheen zal haar stem ook in de toekomst gehoor vinden
2282937 zonder twijfel zou dit in de op alle fronten zieke duitse maatschappij meer te wensen zijn dan ergens anders
2282938 vaak zijn zij men denke nu slechts aan de linksliberale media juist antichristelijk ingesteld
2282939 zo erg als nu is de situatie nog nooit geweest
2282940 het dagelijks leven is totaal ontwricht de meeste mensen durven de straat niet op
2282941 in de doop worden we door god bij onze naam genoemd maar de doop moet zijn uitwerking krijgen in ons dagelijkse leven
2282942 dat proces is echter niet af als het niet bezegeld is met de doop wij maken immers deel uit van een gemeenschap daarin is de doop een markeringspunt
2282943 de liefde van jezus christus komt in de doop tot ons wat hij ons in het evangelie belooft wordt aan mij in de doop verzegeld
2282944 in de doop gaat een mens met christus de dood in en staat hij met hem op in een nieuw leven dat laat zich niet psychologisch verklaren of proclameren het is het geheim van de geest
2282945 d t wordt in de doop versterkt we moeten niet met de doop beginnen maar met het evangelie
2282946 hij heeft ons op het oog in de samenhang van ons en onze kinderen
2282947 maar voor een baptist is het de vraag of daarmee recht gedaan is aan de doop
2282948 de overdoop is dan een bewuste keus van de volwassene om gedoopt te worden
2282949 mensen zijn weer op zoek naar god dat geeft nieuwe moed
2282950 ons werk moet ergens toe leiden het probleem is niet dat mensen terechtkomen in evangelische gemeenten maar er is jammer genoeg een flinke groep die het christenzijn beleeft zonder naar de kerk te gaan
2282951 er kwamen flink wat mensen op af maar zij maakten de stap naar de gewone kerkdiensten niet
2282952 we liepen blijkbaar voor de muziek uit en hebben nu besloten om het accent te blijven leggen op de gewone kerkdiensten
2282953 deelnemers ervaren deze meetings als een goede tussenstap tussen de alpha cursus en de gewone kerkdiensten
2282954 daarom zijn we nog tot zes uur zaterdagavond te bewonderen op de paal met dit paalzitten hopen we toch een behoorlijk bedrag te vergaren
2282955 met de voorbereidingen hiervan zijn we in januari al begonnen
2282956 omdat we in de tuin van onze eigen baptistengemeente zitten hebben we wel wat moeten passen en meten want hoe krijgen we zestien palen hoe zetten we die in de grond en hoe krijgen we er zestien jongeren 24 uur op das een hele klus geweest maar ze staan er wij zijn er klaar voor
2282957 je moet wat h wil je de komende 24 uur wakker blijven om je missie te volbrengen maar als ik ergens voor ga dan g ik er ook voor daarvoor ben ik speciaal uit rotterdam gekomen
2282958 we hebben al wat sponsorgeld binnen de teller staat nu al op ruim vijfhonderd euro
2282959 wij beiden sponsoren haar ze krijgt van ieder van ons n cent voor elke vijf minuten dat ze blijft zitten
2282960 dat geld geven we van ons eigen zakgeld en dat kan best oplopen hoor
2282961 als ze 24 uur op de paal blijft zitten dan geef ik haar vijftig euro
2282962 ik weet wat er aan de hand is en waarom de jongeren hier paalzitten
2282963 een nobel streven zeker in deze tijd waarin men zegt dat jongeren het niet zo nauw nemen als het om normen en waarden gaat laat de mensen vandaag maar eens komen kijken en luisteren waar zij het voor doen
2282964 aan de mensen die zaterdag willen komen kijken n ons geld willen schenken verkopen we koffie thee frisdrank cake en stroopwafels
2282965 are putting plans in place to provide food drinking water mosquito nets temporary shelter pots and pans and basic medicine
2282966 inundating the irrawaddy delta with tidal waves and floodwaters and smashing much of the fragile infrastructure of rangoon the countrys largest city and commercial hub
2282967 we hope the bell is intact it may be like the liberty bell with a big crack in it we may have to get out the duct tape
2282968 op 13 jarige leeftijd choqueerde ik mijn zondagsschoolklas door de lichamelijke opstanding van jezus te ontkennen vanaf die leeftijd begonnen de twijfels onweerstaanbaar op te komen
2282969 een metafysische en filosofische fundering gaf voor het idee van een persoonlijk god en het gaf me een metafysische basis voor de waardigheid en waarde van de hele menselijke persoonlijkheid
2282970 diep in mijn hart ben ik uiteindelijk een ambtsdrager een baptistenpredikant
2282971 er is geen zwart amerika en blank amerika en latino amerika en aziatisch amerika we hebben de verenigde staten van amerika
2282972 de zonden van ons verleden en de uitdagingen van het heden worden erkend zonder gevangen te worden in cynisme en wanhoop
2282973 niet bereid is een interpretatie van de bijbel te accepteren die een obscure lijn in romeinen meer bepalend vindt voor het christendom dan de bergrede
2282974 we willen geen besloten gemeente zijn maar ons zichtbaar maken
2282975 ik voel me gesteund door de heer in ingrijpende tijd na de brand
2282976 het was de bedoeling dat ik binnenkort officieel als voorganger zou worden bevestigd nu mijn plaatselijke beroepbaarstelling rond is maar waarschijnlijk wachten wij daarmee en combineren de bevestigingsdienst met de heropening van het gebouw
2282977 vanaf het begin klikte het heel goed misschien had ik eerder voorganger in deze gemeente kunnen worden maar mijn moeder werd ernstig ziek op dat moment lag daar mijn taak op 9 januari is zij overleden
2282978 voor mij was het ingrijpend zon ernstige gebeurtenis in mijn eerste gemeente
2282979 in deze tijd voel ik mij zeer gesteund door de heer als voorganger moet je er zijn voor de mensen velen van hen hebben voor de tweede keer gezien dat het kerkgebouw waaraan zij hebben gewerkt in brand staat dat raakt mensen behoorlijk nadat de brand was geblust maakten wij in het gras een kring hebben gebeden en daarna het lied stel mijn vertrouwen op de heer mijn god gezongen ik voelde mij toen gesteund door god hij gaf mij de juiste woorden om de mensen toe te spreken en voor het gebed in de week na de brand heeft de heer mij op het hart gelegd de eerst volgende zondag te spreken over filippenzen 4 verheugt u in de here te allen tijd het is een gedurfde tekst in deze omstandigheden maar het is ook heel toepasselijk met paulus worden wij nu uitgedaagd om dat samen waar te maken
2282980 in deze moeilijke tijd weten wij ons ook gesteund door andere gemeenten door een kaartje of e mail en een bloemstuk van onze buurkerk
2282981 het is heel bemoedigend te merken dat we er niet alleen voor staan maar dat we gesteund worden zelfs over kerkmuren heen dat is geweldig zo kun je met elkaar kinderen van god zijn en mag je er voor elkaar zijn
2282982 het is een warme gemeente en ze geven me de tijd om me in te werken
2282983 uit roeping ben ik theologie gaan studeren voor mij was deze hbo opleiding het meest haalbare vanaf de mavo heb ik mij opgewerkt ook de interkerkelijke richting van de eth spreekt mij aan het houdt je scherp door verschillende overtuigingen moet je nu met argumenten komen en de discussie met elkaar aangaan maar ik heb ook gemerkt dat ondanks de verschillen er veel zaken zijn die samenbinden verder worden hier de talen grieks en hebreeuws op hoog niveau gegeven dat is belangrijk zo kun je bij de preekvoorbereiding commentaren controleren anders moet je altijd op anderen afgaan en word je een soort naprater
2282984 zo leer je van de seizoenen in een gemeente de op en afbouw van activiteiten maak je huwelijksdiensten en begrafenissen mee en krijg je eerder bepaalde taken in die gemeente toegewezen ik heb ook gemerkt dat je in het pastoraat verder in gesprekken kunt doordringen mensen nemen je in vertrouwen er ontstaat meer openheid je bent niet meer een vreemde eend in de bijt
2282985 dat is ook de belangrijkste reden waarom ik de 4 jarige opleiding over 6 jaar heb uitgespreid door meer spreekbeurten te houden en al tijdens de opleiding in de gemeente aan het werk te zijn houd je meer feeling met de praktijk bovendien voorkaret het dat je heel wetenschappelijk gaat spreken waardoor mensen je niet meer begrijpen die praktijkervaring vind ik heel waardevol als je begint met je bediening heb je al veel ervaring opgedaan en kom je niet gelijk voor allerlei nieuwe dingen te staan
2282986 anders ben je alleen maar op geestelijk niveau bezig en thuis aan het werk door zon bijbaantje zie ik waar mensen op de werkvloer mee worstelen die kennis kan ik gebruiken in mijn werk in de gemeente
2282987 zo leer je van de seizoenen in een gemeente de op en afbouw van activiteiten maak je huwelijksdiensten en begrafenissen mee en krijg je eerder bepaalde taken in die gemeente toegewezen ik heb ook gemerkt dat je in het pastoraat verder in gesprekken kunt doordringen mensen nemen je in vertrouwen er ontstaat meer openheid je bent niet meer een vreemde eend in de bijt
2282988 dat is ook de belangrijkste reden waarom ik de 4 jarige opleiding over 6 jaar heb uitgespreid door meer spreekbeurten te houden en al tijdens de opleiding in de gemeente aan het werk te zijn houd je meer feeling met de praktijk bovendien voorkomt het dat je heel wetenschappelijk gaat spreken waardoor mensen je niet meer begrijpen die praktijkervaring vind ik heel waardevol als je begint met je bediening heb je al veel ervaring opgedaan en kom je niet gelijk voor allerlei nieuwe dingen te staan
2282989 maar een ding kan ik jullie vertellen jezus heeft me nooit in de steek gelaten
2282990 met mijn gezin ben ik in 1990 naar de toendra verhuisd als arts kon ik veel betekenen voor de nentsen tussen wie we wonen steeds weer vertel ik hen van gods liefde het is vaak als ploegen op de rots maar toch altijd ook zaaien op hoop ik moet geen grote opwekking verwachten evangelisatie onder hen vraagt levenslange toewijding soms twijfel ik en ben bedroefd
2282991 door evangelisatie onder de jagers en rendierfokkers is in het zuiden van nentsi een opwekking onder toendrabewoners ontstaan de behoefte om samen te komen onder de verkondiging van het woord van god is groot we hopen u hierover meer te vertellen
2282992 in het caribisch gebied is het in opkomst ik heb al van meer eilanden gehoord waar een doopdienst in de gevangenis plaats vond maar nog nergens zo vaak en zo massaal als hier op curacao voor zover m j bekend is iets dergelijks in nederland en zelfs in europa nog nooit gebeurd
2282993 christenen in iran zijn in de greep van de angst
2282994 in het hele land zijn alle kerkelijke denominaties hard aangepakt
2282995 dieptepunt was de arrestatie van bijna negentig kerkleiders in september 2004 van hen zit hamid pourmand nog vast sinds ahmadinejad aan de macht is is de vervolging verhevigd ik heb begrepen dat alle burgemeesters opdracht hebben gekregen de christelijke celgroepen op te rollen
2282996 de machthebbers zijn enorm geradicaliseerde bevolking niet maar juist zij beslissen over leven en dood
2282997 de regering ziet het liefst dat ze terugkeren naar de islam en heeft kerken verboden voormalige moslims te helpen kerken van etnische christenen trekken hun handen af van moslimbekeerlingen dat is erg spijtig
2282998 dat is een nadeel want deze christenen zijn pas tot geloof gekomen zij weten weinig van de bijbel en bijbeluitleg af de kans dat hierdoor dwaalleringen ontstaan is groot toch is er een redelijk omvangrijke groep christenen met een moslimachtergrond die dapper doorgaat ze laten zich niet door de overheid intimideren en gaan gewoon door met evangelisatie moslims die in de afgelopen twee jaar de here jezus hebben leren kennen vrezen niets of niemand
2282999 er komen op dit moment inderdaad veel moslims tot bekering alle berichten wijzen op een sterke geestelijke groei ik zou er persoonlijk misschien nog niet direct de term opwekking aan koppelen maar er is in ieder geval sprake van kerkbloei
2283000 iran is een van de naties met de jongste bevolking ter wereld de gemiddelde leeftijd is 24 jaar
2283001 iran vormt helaas geen uitzondering op het wereldwijde gegeven dat het voor christenen in moslimlanden bijzonder moeilijk is om een volwaardige plek in te nemen ir de samenleving
2283002 ze worden via plaatselijke netwerken opgeleid met name om actief te zijn in jeugd en jongerenwerk
2283003 onder jongeren in iran zien we een opmerkelijke openheid voor het evangelie zij zijn na de islamitische revolutie van 1979 geboren in vergelijking met leeftijdgenoten in bijvoorbeeld pakistan waar ik enkele weken geleden was zijn zij veel minder fanatiek moslim ze houden niet van het harde gezicht van de islam in hun land afgezet tegen ervaringen in andere arabische landen zien we hier veel meeropeningen voor het evangelie dat is bijzonder bemoedigend
2283004 dat was kort na de verkiezingen die door ahmadinejad zijn gewonnen
2283005 ik ben op diverse plekken in iran geweest zowel in teheran als in het noorden lokale christenen vertelden me dat het regime plotseling veel strenger is geworden ze zijn bang voormalig president khatami heeft diverse keren in het openbaar gezegd dat hij christenen en andere minderheden in zijn land respecteerde en hun bijdrage aan de samenleving belangrijk vond dat liet hij ook merken want bij culturele evenementen was hij altijd aanwezig of stuurde hij een vertegenwoordiger christenen ervaarden dat als een stuk bescherming nu is het klimaat drastisch veranderd er lopen mannen met geweren rond die je bijvoorbeeld terechtwijzen als ze vinden datje hoofddoek niet goed zit vooral christenen worden streng gecontroleerd
2283006 zonder dat ze letterlijk zeggen dat ze zich tot het christendom willen bekeren stellen moslims christenen vragen als heb je een bijbel voor me mag ik een keer een kerkdienst bijwonen of hoe kan ik me laten dopen ik weet dat bijvoorbeeld de assyrische kerk daar niet op ingaat omdat men bang is dat dit koppen kan kosten letterlijk misschien maar ik heb ook individuele christenen gesproken die niet met moslims over hun geloof spreken uit angstvoorde autoriteiten je kunt heel snel straffen krijgen als je ervan wordt verdacht moslims te bekeren de situatie is heel beangstigend zowel voor christenen als voor de moslims die zich willen bekeren
2283007 ook vanuit andere landen binnen en buiten europa worden christelijke voor deze regio gemaakt
2283008 binnenkort gaat sama tv zelfs 24 uur per dag en zeven dagen per week uitzenden
2283009 als ik me beperk tot de programmas die vanuit nederland zijn gemaakt durf ik te stellen dat er in iran elke dag gemiddeld tien moslims tot geloof komen na het zien van onze uitzendingen een bekende moellah islamitische geestelijke red in iran heeft de regering en de moslims tegen onze programmas gewaarschuwd in zijn vrijdaggebed waarbij hij datzelfde aantal noemde zijn waarschuwing heeft zelfs het nieuws gehaald in iran
2283010 ik weet dat enkele kerkleiders te horen hebben gekregen dat ze vermoord zullen worden als er door toedoen van hun gemeente nog n moslim christen wordt door dergelijke dreigementen durven de offici le bij de autoriteiten bekende kerken weinig te doen voor ex moslims
2283011 vandaag belde een van mijn contactpersonen me op hij was ooit drugsdealer toen hij een satellietontvanger kreeg en die installeerde stuitte hij op onze uitzendingen de heilige geest raakte hem aan in plaats van drugs verspreidt hij nu het evangelie in iran vanmorgen zei hij farshid ik heb een probleem mijn dochter vertelt overal over het evangelie veel andere kinderen en hun ouders willen er nu ook meer over weten gebed om bescherming voor mensen zoals deze man en zijn dochtertje die god onder moeilijke omstandigheden vurig dienen is dringend nodig
2283012 de godsdienstige activiteiten van de gemeente voor drie maanden moesten worden stopgezet
2283013 geen geloofsbelijdenis of een volledige verklaring van ons geloof noch definitief of onfeilbaar
2283014 de kerken zien nieuwe mogelijkheden voor evangelisatie en werken onder jongeren vooral diaconale hulp biedt ingangen voor het evangelie
2283015 direct na de val van het sovjetrijk groeiden de kerken erg snel na zeventig jaar communisme waren mensen dorstig naar het goede nieuws naar de bijbel en gods woord en wilden zij meer over jezus weten de orthodoxe kerk was op dat moment zwak en voorzag niet in de vervulling van geestelijke behoeften
2283016 ze hebben in het communisme geloofd en dat systeem viel plotseling weg mensen bezochten onze evangelisatiegroepen ook andere kerken werden op missionair terrein actief onze baptistengemeenten kregen regelmatig bezoek van buitenlanders wat eveneens de interesse van de bevolking opwekte want weinigen in georgi hadden contact met buitenlanders
2283017 de bijbel is nu te koop maar voor velen te duur er is nog steeds grote behoefte aan meer kennis en informatie voor de orthodoxe kerk was het lezen van de bijbel nooit gebruikelijk ze beschouwden de bijbel als een relikwie die onder het stof ligt orthodoxen hebben de kerk alleen nodig voor doop huwelijk en begrafenis maar zien het geloof niet als een levende ervaring van de levende god
2283018 nadat het leven stabieler was geworden en de mensen op zoek gingen naar werk en geld kwamen er andere prioriteiten de groei van de kerk begon af te nemen toch zijn kerken nog steeds erg actief op het gebied van evangelisatie vooral onder jongeren ook de diaconale hulpverlening geeft ingang om over het evangelie te spreken de baptistenkerken zien het als hun taak te protesteren tegen de zonden van het volk en de onrechtvaardige verhoudingen in de samenleving als baptisten zijn we er voor het hele volk dat ligt ook in de lijn van de boodschap van jezus bekering van het zondige leven en zorg dragen voor armen zwakken en hulpbehoevenden
2283019 het is nog steeds moeilijk om kerken te bouwen kerken zijn niet officieel geregistreerd en hebben geen wettelijke status zelfs de orthodoxe kerk niet als we grond kopen geldt dat als priv eigendom als kerken zich als kerken willen profileren moeten ze dat doen als ngos daar hebben de kerken bezwaar tegen terecht ook ons diaconale werk kunnen we niet als kerk uitvoeren maar moet gebeuren onder de paraplu van een humanitaire organisatie in ons geval bethani
2283020 er leven veel mensen onder de armoedegrens vijftig procent van de bevolking is werkloos georgi telt 5 miljoen inwoners maar er leven meer dan 1 miljoen georgi rs in het buitenland de meesten van hen leven illegaal in bijvoorbeeld griekenland en turkije ook wonen er veel in amerika al deze mensen sturen geld naar hun familie in georgi om hen te ondersteunen
2283021 ze is erg populair en doet veel aan maatschappelijk werk het georgische volk houdt veel van haar
2283022 ze is een met het volk en ze spreekt supergoed georgisch zonder accent en zonder grammaticale fouten we hadden geen betere presidentsvrouw kunnen treffen ze heeft het hart van het volk gestolen
2283023 net zoals in het bedrijfsleven moeten de jaarcijfers voor 1 juli gepresenteerd en goedgekeurd worden
2283024 we hebben in amerika minder vrije dagen dan in europa meestal maar twee of drie weken in het hele jaar
2283025 veel voorgangers combineren hun bezoek aan de conventie met hun vakantie vrouw en kinderen komen dus mee en voor hen organiseren we aparte activiteiten
2283026 de bevolking van een stad moet weten dat de baptisten zijn gekomen ons doel is dat wanneer een conventie in een stad is gehouden iedere inwoner van die plaats tenminste n keer het evangelie heeft gehoord

2283036 buddhist meditation is leading to an expansion of the science of what it means to be human

2283038 you stop being always projected outside you start looking in and seeing how your mind works and you change your mind thought by thought

2283047 you become familiar with the way emotions arise how they can either overwhelm your mind or vanish without making an impact
2283048 grow and grow and invade your mind so that every single atom of your self is loving kindness and compassion and benevolence
2283049 you let that linger and linger and become more and more part of your mindstream and you do it again and again eventually it becomes easier faster and stronger the rest of the time too not just when youre meditating its like riding a horse in the beginning you have to be very careful not to fall off but pretty soon you even forget youre on a horse
2283050 it is the joy of moving toward inner freedom and of the loving kindness that radiates towards others
2283051 we generate our own suffering by complex processes of self identification

2283082 a two year government sponsored college that offers an associates degree
2283083 nooo como mucho descender del rbol pero del mono no creo
2283084 dat moest gewoon ik wist wel iets van god ben katholiek opgevoed maar dat was niks zeven uur op een uur fietsen naar de mis en pas om kwart voor negen ontbijten toen ik vast zat heb ik god leren kennen
2283085 op een dag liep ik hier binnen in silo ik ging aan een tafeltje zitten in dat hoekje daar
2283086 ik kende niemand ineens voelde ik een arm om me heen er zat iemand naast me met twee koppen koffie
2283087 anderen lijken te zijn overvallen door hun misdaad ze gingen de fout in zonder te zien waar dat toe leidde vaak kregen ze thuis weinig mee mensen kopi ren patronen geen vader kan de liefde geven die hij thuis nooit kreeg deze groep beschouwt hun delict als een groot ongeluk zo bezocht ik een man die in zijn cel de foto van een vrouw had hangen zijn vrouw hij had haar vermoord maar die foto hing daar weloverwogen hij wilde die last dragen
2283088 de een vindt de koffie lekker de ander vindt de lieve oma die hij nooit had prima als mensen zich maar welkom voelen niet denken ik moet bijbellezen niet meer vloeken mijn tatoeages weghalen dat zou voorwaardelijke liefde zijn dat sloopt een mens de werkelijke verandering komt uit de omgang wie zich gewaardeerd voelt wil iets terugdoen zo zitten mensen in elkaar
2283089 het doel van geestelijke verzorgers is het tegenovergestelde te bereiken gevangenen laten zien wat ze hebben aangericht dat maakt bajeskerkdiensten zo ingrijpend de voorganger draait niet om het delict heen hij confronteert de toehoorders via een bijbelverhaal met schuld en boete dat doet pijn maar het raakt de gedetineerden diep juist die confrontatie kan hen helen dat weten ze
2283090 bij de invrijheidsstelling eindigt dat verwerkingsproces niet evangelische kerken kunnen het voortzetten omdat de geloofsbeleving open en persoonlijk is nadeel is dat er weinig ruimte is voor twijfel
2283091 we belijden de vergeving maar raken in diepe verlegenheid als iemand in eigen kring in de fout gaat kerkgangers hangen de vuile was niet buiten zij zijn geneigd hun stand op te houden als geslaagd burger gedetineerden kunnen dat niet meer die zijn al door de mand gevallen maar moet de kerk juist niet deze mensen een perspectief bieden
2283092 want wat is aanbidding precies dat weten alleen kerkgangers oorsprong kent iedereen
2283093 past zijn dienst aan de behoefte aan eenvoud leeft bovendien bij meer gemeenteleden ik preek nu in silo hetzelfde als in de gevangenis dat wil de gemeente
2283094 hans is een goede man ik vertrouwde hem en vertelde hem wat ik gedaan had hij luisterde rustig mijn daden verafschuwde hij toch werd hij niet boos dat deed me wat
2283095 wie wat heeft kan wat verliezen dan kijk je beter uit met wat je hebt
2283096 ik bedenk me wel voor ik nog iets stoms doe
2283097 het begint met vriendelijkheid laten zien dat iemand welkom is als ik een nieuw gezicht zie loop ik er met twee koppen koffie op af
2283098 je trein zien wegrijden langs een plas fietsen waar net een auto doorheen rijdt zo moeilijk is het niet gewoon interesse tonen
2283099 zijn er geldproblemen haalt iemand duistere types over de vloer dat zijn dingen die je niet zomaar vraagt daar is een vertrouwensband voor nodig
2283100 mensen willen hun jas veilig kunnen ophangen dat kan toch al niet zeg ik dan we zitten in hartje utrecht en houden onze deur open laatst stond er ineens een zwerver binnen niemand kende hem dat is een keuze die je als kerk maakt schermen we ons af voor de buitenwereld of willen we een open gemeenschap zijn wij kiezen voor het laatste
2283101 we geven iemand een bepaald vertrouwen dat kan iemand stimuleren om zich waar te maken maar het is ook te misbruiken hoeveel ruimte moet je geven laat geen tasjes slingeren leen niet te snel je sleutels uit dat is uitlokken de rest blijft hopen geen populaire waarde tegenwoordig maar hoop behoort tot de basis van het christelijk geloof geloof hoop en liefde
2283102 we moeten niet te ambitieus zijn denken dat we met onze weldaden mensen op het rechte pad kunnen houden zou zelfoverschatting zijn we geloven simpelweg dat iedere mens het waard is om mee om te gaan god verwerpt ons ook niet christenen zijn niet beter dan andere mensen maar zijn ergens op aanspreekbaar jezus gaf ons een voorbeeld iemand die de verworpene langs de kant van de weg verzorgde zoals wij dat moeten doen de warmhartige samaritaan
2283103 door het priesterlijk werk van christus onderscheidt het christendom zich van het jodendom en van de islam
2283104 maar pas recent is deze zaak ook doorgedrongen tot kringen van bijbelgetrouwe christenen
2283105 taken opgepakt die nu te veel blijven liggen zoals toerusting van gemeenten en specifieke kennisontwikkeling
2283106 een sterkere band tussen het seminarium en de gemeenten ontstaat door de geleverde diensten en door de inzet van vrijwilligers
2283107 een nog klein aantal gemeenten neemt in aantal leden weer toe waarbij een brug geslagen is naar de jeugd buiten of anders kerkelijken veel gemeenten zijn bezig hun visie missie en centrale waarden opnieuw te formuleren of hebben dat al gedaan

2283110 echtparen die geen kinderen willen keren zich tegen gods wil en nemen geen verantwoordelijkheid voor de samenleving
2283111 we groeien op om kinderen te krijgen zonder deze verantwoordelijkheid blijven we een generatie van ouder wordende adolescenten
2283112 huwelijk seksualiteit en kinderen horen bij elkaar wie daar iets aan afdoet wijst gods scheppingsorde af het is een door god gegeven plicht kinderen groot te brengen
2283113 zie de kinderen zijn een erfdeel des heeren des buiks vrucht is een beloning
2283114 het is een grote vooruitgang dat vrouwen zelf kunnen bepalen of ze wel of geen kinderen willen ouderschap is geen plicht maar een optie

2283127 our data suggest that meditation practice can promote cortical plasticity in adults in areas important for cognitive and emotional processing and well being
2283128 these findings are consistent with other studies that demonstrated increased thickness of music areas in the brains of musicians and visual and motor areas in the brains of jugglers in other words the structure of an adult brain can change in response to repeated practice
2283129 the goal is to pay attention to sensory experience rather than to your thoughts about the sensory experience
2283130 for example if you suddenly hear a noise you just listen to it rather than thinking about it if your leg falls asleep you just notice the physical sensations if nothing is there you pay attention to your breathing
2283131 that the differences in brain structure were caused by the meditation rather than that differences in brain thickness got them into meditation in the first place
2283132 it reduces stress and increases my clarity of thought and my tolerance for staying focused in difficult situations
2283133 people who do it quickly realize that much of what goes on in their heads involves random thoughts that often have little substance
2283134 the goal is not so much to empty your head but to not get caught up in random thoughts that pop into consciousness
2283135 if instead you focus on the present moment on what needs to be done and what is happening right now then much of the feeling of stress goes away
2283136 these increases are proportional to the time a person has been meditating during their lives
2283137 this suggests that the thickness differences are acquired through extensive practice and not simply due to differences between meditators and nonmeditators
2283138 but further research needs to be done using a larger number of people and testing them multiple times we also need to examine their brains both before and after learning to meditate our group is currently planning to do this eventually such research should reveal more about the function of the thickening that is how it affects emotions and knowing in terms of both awareness and judgment

2283148 my confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science so in buddhism understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in buddhism to be false then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims
2283149 there is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized
2283150 we have to remember that what we observe is not nature herself but nature exposed to our method of questioning

2283158 even if cyclists who often wear helmets and fluorescent jackets appear omnipresent in good weather they account for only two percent of trips made in london compared to 28 percent in amsterdam or 20 percent in copenhagen

2283229 whoever looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart
2283230 well my invisible man in the sky will make you pay for not following the rules
2283231 if atheism is true then the universe has no explanation of its existence if the universe has an explanation of the universes existence then atheism is not true
2283232 most atheists would admit that the universe does indeed have a beginning hence most atheists are implicitly committed to god being the explanation of why the universe exists
2283233 some may deny this but in reality the universe cannot be infinite that is because it is physically impossible to have an actual infinite number of things or events preceding our today
2283234 i cannot conceive how matter could be eternal therefore the universe exists and therefore goddidit
2283235 i also believe in the existence of god because if god does not exist objective moral values and duties do not exist objective moral values and duties do exist therefore god exists
2283236 fact moral goodness and duty is based on gods character
2283237 this argument holds no weight for me sorry your god of the gaps shrinks every time we fill a gap
2283238 we could be at an arbitrary point in time that extends forever
2283239 the second law of thermodynamics hold i think the supreme position among the laws of nature if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics i can give you no hope there is nothing for it but collapse in deepest humiliation
2283240 what does need its origin explained is the concrete universe itself it does perform a version of the ultimate bootstrapping trick it creates itself ex nihilo
2283241 give me a break the universe is not finely tuned
2283242 i cannot even recall seeing anything else in physics whose accuracy is known to approach even remotely a figure like that
2283243 how can you assert that god is the only thing that can provide objective morality

2283251 i never received direction from george tenet cia director at the time or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2283252 in the next couple days the transcripts will be coming out
2283253 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter
2283254 further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
2283255 as excessive as that got it does take away from the work
2283256 now youre totally getting away from your technique and what youre trying to do as a football team but as far as the mixing it up and the physicality i think its great for both football teams your macho comes out and you see where you are there is some give and take there but we were able to settle those differences and finish up on a good note
2283257 we cant get to where we lose our cool out here its that time of year guys arent in very good moods out here weve just got to make sure we continue to get better its good to see us compete and those things well get rid of the extracurricular stuff it wasnt anything big a couple of little ones
2283258 brett favre media whore heads to media capital of the world
2283259 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2283260 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2283261 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2283262 i spoke to senator clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2283263 those stones wont tell you anything you didnt see just as clearly yesterday
2283264 about the cathedral being alive but youre very wrong about lost souls
2283265 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2283266 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2283267 the big media has tried to be responsible and handle this with kid gloves but its clearly getting ready to bust out
2283268 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2283269 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2283270 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2283271 the abc article noted that she is not ruling out having her name placed in nomination this is actually a pretty substantial bargaining chip to have in her back pocket if you look at the mechanics of having your name placed in nomination

2283326 efficiency is the only major source of 24 7 power that is far cheaper than current electricity prices and five times cheaper than new nuclear coal and natural gas plants
2283327 indeed new nuclear plants are so expensive they are likely to provide electricity at some fifteen cents per kilowatt hour or 50 higher than average retail electricity prices in this country said earlier this year that twin 1 100 megawatt plants it intends to build in triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago

2283335 ellie has undergone nine months of assessments and the clinicians at the cochlear implant centre in southampton support bilateral implants for her
2283336 i believe the pct only considered the extra cost of a second implant not how much less her education will cost if she has both ears operated on now
2283337 we believe that morally ellie should have the operation on the nhs
2283338 looking after ellie is a joy and a pleasure but battling to get what she needs has been the worst part of the last nine months
2283339 the current recommendations from nice support unilateral implants for children and adults with severe to profound deafness

2283343 i would estimate the cost of repairs to all the beach huts to be in the region of 2 000
2283344 i would like to speak to anyone who was at the beach yesterday evening or early this morning particularly anyone fishing or walking their dog
2283345 camping in england no longer equals flimsy tents and sleeping on lumps and bumps visitbritain now even runs a grading scheme for campsites
2283346 there are five star campsites now and more people will go there because you can plug in hair straighteners or watch tv
2283347 its a mix between being right in the countryside but you are also quite comfortable
2283348 there is a woodburner in each tent and running water
2283349 youve got these places that either have pre erected tents with everything in them that you need and perhaps they even provide a food hamper as well
2283350 i think its perhaps people visiting luxury sites that may have turned their noses up at camping a few years ago because they perceived it to be a bit basic or damp and miserable
2283351 but what these camping experiences have done is open up the option of camping to people who dont like to get too dirty or putting their own tent up
2283352 i think a lot of farmers are moving into tourism and they are finding it quite a successful way of diversifying
2283353 there are no signs of dead fish or environmental damage and initial indications are that it is harmless

2283357 i have a wife five kids eight grandkids in america and i have never been in jail in my life
2283358 put a plastic bag over my head grabbed me and i felt kicks and punches coming all over me from all different directions

2283379 i was saying all week long when i come to tennessee i have a strange feeling somebody is going to test me across the middle for whatever reason
2283380 i just kind of bounced right back up finished the play and came on back to the huddle
2283381 because you want to have a constructive practice and you want to have a good working relationship with the other team but at the same time you want your guys to back each others play back your brothers play
2283382 we have to be smart out here and all that stuff but were in training camp guys are fighting for their jobs fighting for their teammates
2283383 we dont back down to anybody thats how we always play ever since that day that former titan lance schulters gave us the name the tennessee tyrants thats what weve been living up to
2283384 i think thats a testament to how well were coached as a group our communication is great everybody knows what to do whats expected of us
2283385 we need to focus a little bit more and stop worrying about kicking peoples butts and stuff and actually do it between the whistles
2283386 i think we got a little more focused on the brawls than the actual play and we let some get by
2283387 but as far as the banging and guys testing us we needed that thats something were trying to build on is our toughness
2283388 we knew there was going to be some pushing and shoving thats cool its training camp theyve been practicing against each other for a while and weve been practicing against each other for a while so its new meat new booty is what we say everybody is sniffing something out

2283395 pressure on foreigners and the increasing reduction in their rights generates a feeling of humiliation anxiety and revolt
2283396 im afraid like all fathers are afraid for their children its like all other sports its more dangerous than playing chess if thats considered a sport but i dont think its more dangerous than horseback riding and riding competitions
2283397 he killed his first animal at 6 he already has scars you dont teach a child to kill at age 6 the role of a parent is to protect their child these parents are not protecting their child they are making him take risks

2283400 insisted that wertz change her report to indicate stable conditions so that the loan could be approved
2283401 ill trained unprofessional appraisers who were willing to knuckle under
2283402 they have threatened and taken so much business away from competent and ethical appraisers who refused to play their games that now we have nothing to lose we are going to fight and were going to tell everybody whats been going on
2283403 the products and underwriting that allowed people to buy houses they couldnt afford have disappeared
2283404 im really not sure that were going to be able to even qualify for a mortgage weve got a lot of graduate and dental school loan debt and i hear its a terrible time in the mortgage market
2283405 a lot of people think that the mortgage market is in much worse shape
2283406 other than subprime and high ltv loan to value ratio stated income

2283423 the direction is towards either a memorandum of understanding on their evacuation or a memorandum of understanding on a timetable for their withdrawal
2283424 the direction is towards either a memorandum of understanding on their evacuation or a memorandum of understanding on programming their presence
2283425 on substantive issues theres not much daylight between the two sides
2283426 the troops will leave when the iraqis are ready to take over but they iraqi leaders need to get what they need and to get cover for it it is politics how you package it how you sell it to your people they want our support but they also want to show that theres progress towards sovereignty

2283441 the colleges annual consumption of cardboard take out boxes has reached nearly 250 000 which to many of us is recognized as excessive
2283442 realizing that not all students professors and college staff have the ability to sit down in the evelyn young dining room for every meal and with a concern about cardboard waste and paper consumption we have spent a great deal of time during the past 18 months trying to put together a program that would meet the needs of our campus community meet sanitation codes from the department of health and save some trees in the process

2283450 when youre running routes for a young quarterback sometimes the balls going to be a little off target he can adjust and make the catch he did that all year
2283451 whether they gave up on me or not it didnt matter it was a chance for me to go somewhere and have a new start and thats just what i needed
2283452 i love his size and how aggressive he is to the ball hes just a playmaker
2283453 just getting the opportunity to go out there and make plays that was all i was asking for
2283454 i figured when i got the chance i could do something i feel like i learned a lot in my four years in chicago and then i got to translate that here on the field for the titans
2283455 justin made the most of an opportunity and we expect him to be a significant contributor to our offensive success
2283456 he should continue to grow as a receiver as he and vince play together more
2283457 just knowing the type of guy he is i knew his true ability would show and it has its always good to see somebody from mizzou do his thing
2283458 the sec always thinks theyre better than any other conference but the big 12 took it to them last year
2283459 im looking forward to what mizzou will do this year
2283460 now its just about going out and building on that using that season as a steppingstone and get better each year thats my ultimate goal
2283461 i am delighted to be able to return to manage once again to what had almost become a second home for me
2283462 over the past months an immense amount of prayer and goodwill has been given to the revitalisation of a totally ecumenical christian resource centre that had become a meeting place a platform for stimulating discussion and debate a peaceful and welcoming refuge for refreshment open to visitors of faith or none we thank god that we are now so close to bearing fruit
2283463 we have found that more customers than ever before want to jump in a car with the family and avoid the hassle and increased costs of an overseas break

2283469 they removed some of the requirements for xbla games but there are still a lot of requirements and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary

2283491 we see this as a pilot project that could explode across the city
2283492 prices have gone up so much now a kilo 2 2 lbs of tomatoes costs 17 pesos before it was 6
2283493 our hope is to cover our needs and if there is a little extra we will have something to sell to our friends
2283494 we started in the most vulnerable areas where people dont have steady jobs where there is high poverty
2283495 he has been out for a year and is not quite ready to start in our team just now
2283496 thisll enable him to get match games which are vital to his rehabilitation
2283497 if he goes there he will hopefully come back on the 1 january as a new player and ready to play a part for burnley football club he desperately needs games
2283498 more than 50 percent of our retail clients holdings in auction rate securities have been redeemed or auctioned at par since the crisis began

2283500 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2283501 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2283502 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2283503 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2283504 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2283505 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2283506 if we lost anywhere from two to five minutes thats potentially five to 10 points you could get on the test
2283507 if i were a person who did not pass and it was by five points and i was in a room that got a five minute disruption from the earthquake i would definitely protest it i would definitely make it an issue
2283508 the proctor did announce in our room that we would get an extra five minutes to finish the exam however promptly at the three hour mark he called time i asked the two gentlemen sitting next to me if we had gotten any extra time by their watches and they said no
2283509 and well take that into account when we do an evaluation of the exam
2283510 a lot of people come across on little things and they learn more and more and more and then before you know it they are seeing green traits in products
2283511 it could be something that they seek out because its less toxic its better for you it tastes better or the quality tends to be better
2283512 they will dispose of it for you in an environmentally responsible way so by being green you are actually making money

2283514 it can decrease your energy usage for light bulbs by nearly 75 percent
2283515 and if youre a little lazy like i am you never have to change them they never die i have light bulbs in my house that have been going for five years and i am used to pulling out my step ladder and changing bulbs but i havent had to do that for a very long time so they save you a lot of money over time
2283516 home electronics use a vast majority of power when they are turned off you have to unplug them because they kind of sip off the energy grid the whole time
2283517 and youre paying for that so if you go around unplugging things it can have a big impact on your utility bill
2283518 its a good idea to go low flow because particularly in the shower you are using water that gets heated by your heating system and youre paying for that twice
2283519 something thats a lot cheaper in the long run is to buy a reusable cloth like buy skoy clothes for 4 and reuse them as you clean the house
2283520 the payback for that is about three years sometimes four years
2283521 the life of the window film is around 15 years so you get 11 years of cost savings
2283522 you can get government tax discounts when you make home improvements that save you energy like new windows and doors
2283523 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly

2283534 my part comes when he joins us and we try to make him a better player
2283535 and anybody who joins us hopefully makes us a better team
2283536 we have had different challenges over the last three years
2283537 we recovered from being knocked out of europe and from the fact that 13 first team players had moved on to win the title back
2283538 we had to maintain that in the second year and retain the title which we did and in the third year we got pushed to the limit

2283569 ministers are not to be set up in competition with one another
2283570 all the ministers and all they are endowed with were all for the use and service of the church for their benefit and advantage wherefore it was very wrong to set up one above or against another or for any party to engross anyone minister when he belonged to them all and it is a great weakness to reject others when they had a common right and property in them

2283576 these characters are modern mythological characters that represent human emotion in a grand and somewhat operatic way
2283577 and if we can access that and combine it with some good action and some great cinematography and music and sound and so on then we could have an exciting emotional movie

2283618 i think theres always something to say women have more to b ch about girls b ch about men and women and guys seem to whine more about women i dont really want to call it b ch sessions with women more like a gossip fest
2283619 i think men have a lot less to say than females but they complain about different things guys seem to deal with their emotional stuff by doing something but girls need to talk about it with each other if i dont have a good talk with my girlfriends i miss it

2283646 i think it will be a regular occurrence and it will probably be what most teams do the college coaches ive talked to have pretty much all told me that everyone pretty much always defers when they win the toss in college its like 100 percent of the time my guess is that it will approach that in the nfl as well in time whether it does right off the bat i dont know it would take some type of extreme conditions or an unusual experience to not do that if you win the toss thats our approach going into it
2283647 hes a great player one of the best players in the last couple of decades he has just about every record you could have at the position he plays it speaks for itself its always a big challenge playing the jets even more so now they have a lot of talent and im sure well have our hands full every time we face them but right now thats not at the forefront of our concerns we have a lot of other things before it would come to that and thats what well focus on but hes a great player there is no question about that
2283648 we had several writers writing a lot of the political stuff

2283650 and i looked at the sketch about a year ago and its all completely accurate
2283651 you know it was actually easier for me if i would have died in iraq my neuropsychologist has told me my left side of my brain has been injured severely so that is your ability to multi task to handle problems so what i do i watch game shows or look at crossword puzzles and even though im in school or at the va learning these processes i do it on my own to try to speed up my healing process im trying to enhance my own ability because im a father i have two kids i have to show them that hey even though daddys not himself you still have to work hard to achieve something

2283657 in the soul of the russian people a struggle between east and west was waged and that struggle is continuing in the russian revolution we shall see that the russian intelligentsia was absolutely non western in type however much it swore by western theories

2283686 the governments policy statement on land transport funding released earlier this week is taking us down a dead end street
2283687 this document is a big disappointment it demonstrates a real lack of regard and concern for the average kiwi and steers away from the important decisions that will create a more sustainable future
2283688 on the one hand our decision makers continue to justify high road spending through ltnz calculations based upon an unrealistically low price for petrol however this policy statement also relies on high petrol prices to encourage more public transport use
2283689 investment bankers are clear that the short term dip in petrol prices cannot be sustained they believe oil may soon top us 200 if this is so according to government logic we seem embarked upon a road building programme that will end up being largely unnecessary
2283690 the policy statement seems both inconsistent and short sighted it also implies that cars are set to become the transport preference of the rich not only does this fail to reflect the true demographic of public transport but it also stigmatises it
2283691 i acknowledge the government has increased spending on public transport over the last ten years but my question is why should we settle for a transport policy with such low expectations
2283692 studies indicate that removing traffic from the street is consistently more economical than building new roads to accommodate it the economic and environmental importance of public transport is not being given sufficient priority and i challenge parties to specifically spell out their public transport plans to the public
2283693 we cant afford to be duped by huge amounts of money being poured into infrastructure if those plans dont give enough attention to public transport we shouldnt keep taking wrong turns its time we got into step with reality and research and time we put our money where our future really is

2283733 porque n o haviam sido instru dos nas tradi es e err neos costumes de seu tempo eram dotados de natural capacidade humildes e d ceis homens a quem podia educar para sua obra
2283734 o salvador os amava a todos mas jo o era o esp rito mais apto a receber lhe a influ ncia era mais jovem que os outros e com mais infantil confian a abria a cristo o cora o
2283735 todo verdadeiro disc pulo nasce no reino de deus como mission rio aquele que bebe da gua viva faz se fonte de vida o deposit rio torna se doador

2283740 as instru es transmitidas aos setenta eram id nticas s comunicadas aos doze mas a ordem dada aos doze de n o entrar em cidade de gentios ou de samaritanos n o foi repetida aos setenta embora cristo houvesse sido repelido pelos samaritanos permaneceu inalter vel seu amor para com eles quando os setenta se foram em seu nome visitaram antes de tudo as cidades de samaria

2283743 sua mensagem teve grande influ ncia em estabelecer o fato de que jesus o messias o redentor do mundo ningu m poderia duvidar de sua sinceridade e atrav s de seus ensinos muitos foram levados a deixar a incredulidade
2283744 com poder e eloq ncia a hist ria do salvador crucificado e ressurgido mantinha firmemente a f e de seus l bios brotava sempre a mesma alegre mensagem o que era desde o princ pio o que ouvimos o que vimos com os nossos olhos o que temos contemplado e as nossas m os tocaram da palavra da vida o que vimos e ouvimos isso vos anunciamos 1jo 1 1 3
2283745 aquele que mais ama a cristo maior soma de bem far
2283746 que jesus o cristo o filho de deus e para que crendo
2283747 dia a dia em contraste com seu pr prio esp rito violento ele contemplava a ternura e longanimidade de jesus e aprendia lhe as li es de humildade e paci ncia abriu o cora o divina influ ncia e se tornou n o somente ouvinte mas cumpridor das palavras do mestre contemplando a cristo transformou se no car ter
2283748 o perfume de nosso amor aos semelhantes o que revela nosso amor a deus

2283910 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2283911 the coalition further decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against general musharraf
2283912 we hope that 90 of the lawmakers will support us
2283913 we have backed him and voted for him so we are duty bound to support him we will oppose impeachment
2283914 as we have consistently said these are internal issues to be resolved by the pakistani people
2283915 and our expectation would be that this will be resolved in a manner consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
2283916 there is a strong likelihood but not certainty that the ruling coalition can impeach him
2283917 the army would be crazy for doing that the army needs to improve its reputation and image with the people of pakistan
2283918 mcdonalds clearly continues to be one of the few consistent performers in a challenging consumer sector
2283919 it is considered that the results indicate that the cautionary warning given on monday can now be lifted and that people should again be able to enjoy swimming and water sports at the main beaches including havelet and the bathing pools
2283920 samples taken on the east coast at bordeaux the victoria marina and fermain have shown somewhat poorer results but these were all within the criteria to pass the eu legal minimum standard
2283921 however whilst emergency discharge of sewage continues at the southside overflow the red lion outfall and the white rock outfall it would of course be sensible for people to exercise caution and avoid swimming or diving in these areas
2283922 i dont think there are any compensation issues here at all as far as the states of guernsey is concerned
2283923 i say that as my personal view primarily because the situation we had here was a force majeure situation
2283924 it was something which came out of the blue and we have a full investigation going on as far as my department is concerned
2283925 hes a very solid defender whether he plays in defence or in midfield
2283926 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2283927 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2283928 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2283929 i hope to play for another two or three years
2283930 i may be 38 in september but i played 47 games last season captained the club and long may that continue
2283931 i look at the results last season and we beat the likes of leeds twice in the big games we proved we could do it
2283932 our away form was awful and it needs to improve but this is a fortress here at whaddon road
2283933 if we continue that form and pick up a few more points away from home theres no reason why we cant be an established league one team and by that i mean a top 10 finish
2283934 i want to stay in the game and the shop will probably look after itself
2283935 i dont actually have to be around that much but i like to be i like to oversee things
2283936 we want all schools around the country to achieve the 1 2 computer to student ratio and this is particularly important for rural regional australia
2283937 round two applications close on october 9 im encouraging those schools in eden monaro that havent met the target to apply as soon as possible so they can be advised of the outcome before the end of the year
2283938 the idea is to provide shared infrastructure that is not met by existing facilities
2283939 collaboration also could involve other partners like local government businesses and community organisations

2283972 if one looks at most of the vital disclosures of the last seven years whereby concealed legally dubious behavior of one of the most secretive administrations of the modern era is exposed one finds that such exposure comes overwhelmingly from two sources 1 conscientious whistle blowers inside the government and 2 advocacy groups such as the aclu which have tirelessly waged one litigation battle after the next in order to unearth the bush administrations secret improper conduct
2283973 the record of the establishment press over the last seven years is one characterized far more by failure and complicity than by real journalism the function of the aclu and similar groups isnt really to uncover illegal behavior on the part of our government that is the intended function of the congress the media and the opposition party but those institutions havent done that as a result the aclu and similar groups with far fewer resources have been forced first to uncover what the government does to try methodically and incrementally to erode the governments wall of secrecy to perform real journalism in order then to engage in their real function of opposing government encroachments and defending the constitution basic privacy rights and civil liberties
2283974 the federal budget deficit was about 371 billion for the first 10 months of fiscal year 2008 cbo estimates 213 billion more than the shortfall recorded over the same period in 2007 revenues were about 1 percent lower than in the same period last year whereas outlays have grown by almost 9 percent cbo estimates that the federal government will end fiscal year 2008 with a deficit in the vicinity of 400 billion close to the amount the agency projected last march after accounting for proposed supplemental appropriations

2283984 although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment and clinical and patient opinion
2283985 nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs

2283989 in common with a lot of other young people i had a fairly disturbed war one way or another what with air raids evacuations and changing schools and it seems to me that the cut off at the age of 16 at the end of the war was rather high particularly bearing in mind that at that time many children left school at 14 and were in work

2284015 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2284016 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2284017 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave

2284022 experts agree that there is a high probability of another influenza pandemic occurring but it is impossible to forecast its exact timing or the precise nature of its impact
2284023 should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2284024 you might want to ask the question for example what happens if many of our heavy goods vehicle drivers fell victim to that influenza and werent able to perform their jobs
2284025 do we have enough back up to be able for example to deliver food to the supermarkets
2284026 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things

2284028 ive been building web sites for years and i felt that there needed to be an upgrade on what was available
2284029 in the big picture its an attempt to engage the health and medical communities with web technology something that is only beginning today
2284030 we have a vast repository of content created by faculty and peer reviewed internally
2284031 our goal is to distribute high quality health information to the general public and thats part of harvard medical schools educational mission
2284032 the aim of the site is just to push out information
2284033 its sort of amazing how many insights non health professionals who have personally experienced disease can provide about that disease
2284034 will enough people contribute enough time and energy to make medpedia what it aspires to become
2284035 we will be announcing our numbers when we launch the site

2284054 demonizaci n de la masoner a est fomentando la xenofobia y el desarrollando ideas fundamentalistas
2284055 bajo mi criterio veo una especie de miedo por parte de este medio el poder aceptar de forma relativa que uno de sus gobernantes es mas n
2284056 cu l ser a la base para creer que efectivamente el presidente del gobierno est afiliado a la masoner a
2284057 todas las grandes iniciativas del se or rodr guez zapatero tienen una especie de tufo mas nico que es clar simo

2284062 pero aunque la sospecha de la adscripci n mas nica de zapatero se fundamenta sobre todo en la tradici n familiar y en su propia gestualidad y lenguaje de la liason ya que hablamos de francmasones entre la pertenencia del abuelo juan rodr guez lozano a la logia emilio men ndez pallar s n mero 15 que funcion activamente en le n hasta la llegada de las tropas de franco y la fundaci n sierra pambley inaugurada por el nieto del capit n lozano no existe duda alguna
2284063 juan rodr guez garc a lozano padre del presidente del gobierno no existe constancia alguna de que pueda pertenecer a ninguna logia mas nica salvo su simpat a colaboradora con sierra pambley
2284064 diversas fuentes leonesas afirman en todo caso que al padre de rodr guez zapatero no se le conoce ni una sola insinuaci n sobre la masoner a ni siquiera se sabe que haya hablado de ella nunca en privado a su c rculo de amigos de siempre en las dos pe as a las que acude con asiduidad

2284077 as i started investigating the scriptures more deeply i came upon scriptures in jeremiah that said we needed to get back to the ancient paths splice and of course christianity comes right out of judaism so those are the ancient paths
2284078 what the messianic movement is is jews and gentiles together worshipping the messiah of israel in a hebraic way with davidic praise and worship as king david would have done with flags and banners
2284079 its very interesting all of what we call the moe din or appointed times
2284080 leviticus 23 i believe is the most important or i should say the most prophetic chapter in the entire word of god it tells about the 7 festivals that adonai has proclaimed to his people and of course the shabbat as well this is a prophetic timetable of what god is going to do in these end times
2284081 i thought wow that looks just like what the lord was talking about in the last days
2284082 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come
2284083 so i did a comparison i went to nasas website to see if there would be any total solar or lunar eclipses in the next 10 years said biltz
2284084 to my surprise in 2014 nasa has what it calls a tetrad 4 total lunar eclipses back to back
2284085 there was a total lunar eclipse on the 1st day of passover and a total lunar eclipse on the 1st day of tabernacles
2284086 the feast of trumpets theres a solar eclipse and theres also a total solar eclipse beginning the religious year
2284087 and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood
2284088 i see with whats going on in the world today with all the turmoil with earthquakes and famines hurricanes and floods i think its a wake up call to both jews and christians that we need to wake up and start looking for the messiah
2284089 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
2284090 actually its very very special because the only place in the entire solar system where you get a total solar eclipse is on the earth
2284091 i didnt know that people were trying to tie biblical prophecy with lunar eclipses and solar eclipses im not surprised that these lunar eclipses are falling on or near jewish holidays because they use a lunar calendar
2284092 its going to happen again in 2014 2015 so im sure well have some interest here at the planetarium
2284093 i noticed the last time this happened was in 1967 after jerusalem was recaptured by israel and it happened again in 1949 and 1950 which is right after israel became a nation in 1948
2284094 when the messiah came he fuflfilled the four spring feasts
2284095 and its believed by a lot of people that the feast of trumpets would be when the messiah comes back to take his bride to be with him for the marriage supper of the lamb
2284096 when it says we wont know the day or the hour what its actually referring to was the feast of trumpets the feast of trumpets was the feast day where no one knew the day or the hour that it would begin because it was based on the sighting of the new moon
2284097 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
2284098 our mission here is bring our city back to god we want to see our city changed positively
2284099 i think without a doubt we are living in the last days we can look at signs in the heavens scripture is very clear that it talks about those but theres also several other clear signs 30 that point to the fact that these are the end days were living in
2284100 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places
2284101 the event that the bible says will take place is basically a peace treaty that will be made with israel and its enemies around it
2284102 the scene is set the bible has never missed it prophetically
2284103 from a jewish eschatological point of view and a christian were both looking for a messiah and its like the times are upon us
2284104 i would say get ready i would say ask god what he would like you to do
2284105 i get excited i think we need to be on our toes or should i say on our knees we need to be looking to the lord

2284111 en casa los temas de inmigraci n siempre estuvieron muy presentes habl bamos de eso mientras cen bamos y aunque yo vivo ya tan lejos de la frontera
2284112 every now and then i get a little bit lonely like youre never coming round
2284113 this is my moment this is my perfect moment with youuuuu
2284114 poshly hi my name is matthew parker and i was just wondering where the location of the drinking water is
2284115 by the end of the day ill have a complete lego car
2284116 hi my name is matthew parker and the butter is that way
2284117 hi im matthew parker and i dont know whats funnier what dave just said or you two idiots laughing
2284118 high pitched voice god please make david come see me im awesome hes awesome yeah
2284119 high pitched voice god please make david go away from me im awesome hes a freak mehh
2284120 i hate shopping im fed up with walking it better not rain im going to have arguments with you god
2284121 hi my name is matthew parker and i think you smell good
2284122 hello how are you are you sad that were leaving today
2284123 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2284124 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2284125 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2284126 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2284127 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2284128 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2284129 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2284130 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2284131 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2284132 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2284133 shed new light on the best locations for turbines to be installed
2284134 wind speeds vary considerably and since speed is the key determinant of power the performance of small wind turbines is very sensitive to their location
2284135 turn the concerned individual in to an active citizen in the fight against climate change
2284136 is a low budget publication or was its no longer a publication im quitting after this
2284137 we have come to know that these kashmiri leaders have been included in the delegation therefore we doubt the integrity of this delegation since they are responsible for the present turmoil in the state
2284138 i hope in the remaining nine months we make up for the lost time and push through some legislature and some non legislature measures if we dont that will be tragic we lost time because of the left parties which said without their consent we could not move forward
2284139 i sincerely hope those political parties which support the legislature measures in the committees will also do so on the floor of the house if they dont that will be tragic those members who point out that we are losing time and recommend passage of bills in the committees should help in pushing the reforms agenda
2284140 a view from the outside why good economics works for everyone
2284141 i have nothing against the left parties we only disagreed in spite of depending on their support from outside though we were able to work together on various programmes in the social sector such as the national rural employment guarantee act the right to information act etc we could not work together in some other areas
2284142 because of the fractured polity there is very little we can do in a coalition government we can only lay out an agenda and try to implement as much as possible in five years there is no great by partisanship in this country as we have so many political parties chidambaram observed hence my appeal to the people is vote for your idea of india and to a political party which comes closest to that idea my pitch is for democracy in which people deserve a government that delivers the only way a government can deliver is to vote for a party that gets a working majority then you see things happen
2284143 we will continue our efforts on saturday for reaching a consensus
2284144 as the deadline set by the president for forming a coalition government expired today the new government will now be formed through voting in the constituent assembly said cpn uml general secretary jhalanath khanal
2284145 we failed to forge an agreement on the formation of new government as per the constitutional provision and appeal from the president but it doesnt mean that an agreement is not possible from now on
2284146 we could not agree on the common minimum programme and ministerial portfolios
2284147 the days of meetings could not even enter the issue of cmp power sharing ministerial allocation code of conduct and on who should lead the government cannot be finalise
2284148 if china has the policy of improving life style its alright if they improve the villages as well they always threaten tibet it is our right to protest why are they always intervening in tibetan affairs it is our right to protest
2284149 there is a feeling that there is discrimination against the people in jammu region and they have been taken for granted while the people in the kashmir valley have been pampered
2284150 though it is a one day trip it may take two days depending on the number of delegations which give representation to the all party team
2284151 so far we have detained nearly 600 tibetans for violating government orders
2284152 was wir bisher immer nur vermuten konnten wird jetzt durch zahlen untermauert

2284155 people are most definitely able to use this service as well
2284156 once upon a time exchanges were owned by the sell side so there was no reason to do this but as the prevailing economics of the industry come under pressure ex changes have to generate other sources of revenue
2284157 the idea that a client will go to a single dark pool just because an exchange runs it simply doesnt wash because liquidity is fragmenting and will continue to fragment and the role of the agent broker in all this is to source all the available liquidity from all the available venues
2284158 we are seeing innovation in terms of willingness to compete but the thing thats lacking is product innovation and differentiation
2284159 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2284160 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2284161 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2284162 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2284163 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2284164 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2284165 the community has been made aware of the plans to redevelop the site
2284166 its a shame to see a tree like that one fall in a big heap
2284167 how many trees like that have been in the town for so long
2284168 concrete boxes seem to be replacing tress all over the state these days

2284170 replacing one liberal with another doesnt help the cause at all to save the river murray
2284171 together with nick xenophon family first holds the balance of power in the senate
2284172 electing a lower house family first member in mayo gives tremendous clout towards securing the river
2284173 big business are investing in technology to reduce their workforce
2284174 while rbs does face the threat of further writedowns and or a uk recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on writedowns and has the benefit of diversification away from the uk
2284175 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2284176 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns
2284177 virtualization is now a key strategic theme for every it department
2284178 make clear that we are followers of jesus christ and are therefore to be defined theologically and not politically or culturally
2284179 believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved
2284180 it gives you much more to work with if youre filming in that world instead of a green screen
2284181 you have to bring a story to life in a movie in a way you dont have to in a book even a book as powerful as that
2284182 i think whats made this story so universally loved is because its really about protecting your child no matter what the circumstances
2284183 theres a small group of senior forwards who have made a pact and what has happened to sammy is part of their rules its a case of short sharp pain for long term gain youve got to send the right message to everyone the biggest penalty you can have when you are dropped from a team is to be stopped from playing footy
2284184 the new standard is more risk based and scalable which will better meet the needs of investors public companies and auditors alike
2284185 the new auditing standard by focusing the auditors attention on those matters that are most important to effective internal control presents another significant opportunity to strengthen the financial reporting process
2284186 the commissions direction to its staff will focus the remaining work in four areas aligning the pcaobs new auditing standard as 5 with the secs proposed new management guidance under section 404 particularly with regard to prescriptive requirements definitions and terms scaling the 404 audit to account for the particular facts and circumstances of companies particularly smaller companies encouraging auditors to use professional judgment in the 404 process particularly in using risk assessment and following a principles based approach to determining when and to what extent the auditor can use the work of others

2284216 countries like australia have always relied on imgs to provide medical services particularly to rural and remote regions once a country has established the need to recruit an img because they are unable to secure the services of a domestic graduate it has an ethical responsibility to ensure that they encounter a fair system
2284217 arguably australia also has a moral obligation to utilise the expertise of its own img citizens and permanent residents first rather than draw on the precious medical manpower resources of other countries particularly those from the developing world
2284218 the proposed national registration system is an exciting opportunity to explore these options and build a better system for australia in the future but the success of these reforms will largely depend on the ability of the individual stakeholders to put aside their differences and self interests to work together towards a common goal the establishment of a healthcare system that supports and respects all healthcare workers australian and internationally trained alike
2284219 the score cards arent about compliance or getting to a score its about results that agencies are producing

2284260 still getting paid after 62 years in coaching im trying to phase out i need to phase out
2284261 and shes with me all the time i dont want to be a distraction to the team i observe now more than i participate i sit on the sideline and sort of critique phil can take it and run with it or not
2284262 was my legacy now its pretty much phils it was mine to leave to him and he has the staff now that understands it and can teach it
2284263 for a coach to turn over his offense to an assistant and to say so publicly is extraordinary
2284264 evolve because opposing defenses are taking some options away because theyve played against it so much the last 20 plus years but that doesnt matter well find something else from reading the defense to use successfully
2284265 its not just the system there are flaws in the system its a jump shot offense it doesnt really allow for open court driving to the basket and there are a lot of coaches who have tried it and failed at it jim cleamons on jacksons staff in chicago and now in los angeles tried it in dallas and it didnt work cotton fitzsimmons tried it in phoenix one year and didnt get out of preseason he junked it in portland what we ran was similar the operation of the true triangle is that anybody can go into the post and i said no bill walton will go into the post when its going yes its so beautiful but so is any offense when its executed properly the thing is phil has always had a player that when youre not getting the shots you want from the triangle that player can get his own shot
2284266 the offense is very good but you have to have a guy who can generate his own shot late in the shot clock and thats the bailout tex doesnt like to hear that because youre not supposed to get to that point in the shot clock but if you do you have to have that guy who in a spread floor can get his own shot
2284267 danny ainge and kevin mchale dont you think they collaborated on all this
2284268 reds ghost swayed mchale to make the kevin garnett trade with boston last year rather than with someone else

2284272 was that after the fifth game after we had the game stolen away from us after a bad call out of bounds and gave the ball back to sacramento and they made a three point shot theres a lot of things going on in these games and theyre suspicious but i dont want to throw it back to there
2284273 you know the league needs a game 6 in this series so we never had a chance tonight
2284274 i just didnt ask those questions obviously its not a great injury to have
2284275 it does at times more than we would want i can tell you that but we have no choice so yeah
2284276 we didnt play with one until the second half the other night we were fortunate to win the game we absolutely have to play that way now from this point forward with the injuries theyre clearly mounting for us but our team has been pretty good at gathering themselves and covering up for each other
2284277 i felt the veteran players on our team responded really well to blowing a 24 point lead in game 4
2284278 if theyre aggressive and energized and playing the kind of basketball that we need to play then he can sit back and be a facilitator if they need him in attack mode with the ball then thats where hes going to take the bull by the horns and start playing ball the way he can and only he can
2284279 they were described as being more fundamentally sound able to outsmart the other teams all that bogus ludicrous stuff
2284280 not a single person in the media has asked me about it

2284283 i went from crying when bird stole the ball from isiah and rooting against everything associated with larry bird to having him as one of the biggest basketball influences in my life
2284284 birds as much a brotha as anybody we were from totally different worlds yet had so much in common it was awesome i came back with larry on his first trip back to boston as coach i get goose bumps thinking about it
2284285 i dont think enough people know that coach auerbach empowered bill russell hired him as head coach at a time when i dont think any owner in any sport was doing that kind of thing that was about 40 years ago you have to love that about him
2284286 my dads best friend was clifford ray who is black charles dudley charles johnson the warriors black players they were the guys who were around when i was a kid and i loved them but in cyo basketball we had no black guy on my team there was only one black kid in the league in northern california we went to oakland once in the sixth grade beat a predominantly black team there and had to have a police escort out of there sixth grade the thing is there are certain perceptions about players or teams but i think the bigger point to be made is most guys ive really gotten to know get past it all so quickly its not even a thought
2284287 probably hasnt even hit me yet because we havent slept in about four days going on five days now going to the finals im just hoping to get some sleep
2284288 it was the best fourth quarter we played all playoff long
2284289 we had it and we didnt get over the hump
2284290 it was probably the best thing because now we can say we have gone through some stuff and were still standing

2284303 the technology is there now to allow people to be connected and to be heard in ways that have never been done before
2284304 what were trying to do is use the power of technology to basically leverage peoples personal political power and make it that much stronger were not doing it from a party perspective were doing it from a people perspective
2284305 we had been thinking of this as a way to connect people to their politics in a normal way

2284323 russia launched a blunt and open invasion of georgia and has challenged the international community and its established democracy

2284330 we were trying for an emphasis in academics within a faith setting that would be open to anyone

2284337 the people of berlin experienced the full range of barack obamas charisma on thursday evening
2284338 contrary to my diplomatic advisors i never thought hillary clinton had a chance i always said obama would be chosen
2284339 but i am a world citizen and what you do will affect us if we see that the u s is changing its good for all of us
2284340 everything is moving he obama is a symbol of this new evolution

2284360 this new productivity data along with subdued wage increases indicate the fed may keep interest rates steady for the balance of 2008 and early 2009
2284361 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2284362 its not a bad report the fed has kept core inflation in check so we dont have a second round knock on effect
2284363 we are seeing weakening unit labor cost you have a weak labor market a weakening economy and good fed policy

2284370 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2284371 i think the actual olympics themselves the venues the guests the athletes are going to be safe
2284372 theres obviously significant numbers of uighurs with some sort of cause who have a grudge against chinese authority and are prepared to use violence to seek whatever objectives theyre seeking
2284373 the people of all ethnic groups in kashi will remember you forever
2284374 we need someone with good language skills and most uighurs cant speak chinese well we also have high standards for cleaning the rooms and uighurs just cant meet those standards
2284375 i dont like the chinese because they dont like uighurs we are muslims and they dislike islam we have different values were two different people
2284376 full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness and its all over much too quickly
2284377 there is a definite myth that happiness is something we have to search for and find through our circumstances and we either find it or we dont
2284378 people say ill be happy when i move to that city when we have more money when i get that job when i lose weight but the correlation between and happiness is smaller than youd expect because people adapt and return to their baseline happiness
2284379 its not that money doesnt make us happy it doesnt make us as happy as we expect or for as long as we think
2284380 many studies have found people do get happier following a salary raise but then get used to that income change their goals and aspirations accordingly and feel they need more to be happy
2284381 people would buy these beautiful homes and then adapt and want the new bath or the pool
2284382 then they would adapt to that and renovate again you have to keep consuming to get that high
2284383 europeans get this they live in little apartments and might not have cars but they spend money on food wine and travel as opposed to having a bigger tv set
2284384 we have very high expectations and part of that comes from our individualistic ethic in the u s
2284385 we believe we can be successful if we try hard enough and have the american dream but if we believe that our lives are under our control when things go wrong we only have ourselves to blame in more people dont blame themselves as much if things arent working out its not just about you
2284386 thats why theres an emphasis on science to look at what is effective what works how it works and why it works
2284387 just give me money and read my pointless articles and books and go to my seminars then you will be happy
2284388 how can you not know you have a volcano under your city
2284389 en estos momentos las fuerzas surosetas han conseguido imponer el control sobre gran parte de tsjinvali las tropas georgianas controlan parte del sur de la ciudad
2284390 las tropas gubernamentales controlan plenamente la ciudad de tsjinvali y casi toda osetia del sur
2284391 no se puede hablar de fuerzas surosetas en realidad son soldados y aviones de rusia aviones que acaban de bombardear las ciudades de senaki y poti

2284395 they have got a roof over their heads but they cant move on with their lives until they have a proper home
2284396 well im quite comfortable of being accused of carrying out a personal vendetta against child abusers i dont think i shall lose any sleep over that
2284397 i dont want to spend too much time talking about that small minority of politicians who have been criticising the inquiry at almost every opportunity most of it based on false information
2284398 and i was like well kind of like how it felt to be the first black assistant fire chief
2284399 twenty seven years ago the city hires me and at that time i am a lean mean 130 pound fire fighting machine
2284400 and im going to be honest with you because my family is here 30 pounds of it was an afro
2284401 obviously im extremely happy about it we worked together for years and he was on my staff and he took every opportunity to build his skills to go to the national fire academy and to put himself in the position where he could be a chief someday
2284402 im very happy for him and happy for the department
2284403 petrolatum or better known as petroleum jelly is sometimes blended with paraffin wax and used in medicines and in many toiletries and healing moisturizers paints lacquers and printing inks all have within them petroleum based solvents to make them flow better besides your automobile engine all machinery like the engine in your lawn mower need lubricating oils and grease made from petroleum to keep them running smoothly petroleum or paraffin wax is used in packaging candles matches shoe polish and even candy making asphalt we use to pave our driveways roads and airfields is a byproduct of petroleum asphalt also is used to surface canals dams and reservoirs we can find this in the linoleum we cover our floors with and in the shingles we put on our roofs petroleum coke is used as a raw material for many carbon and graphite products these products include furnace electrodes and liners and the anodes used in the production of aluminum aluminum is used in the construction of just about all of our everyday appliances

2284405 if its the ninth inning so be it i like being in that situation youve got a young guy in c j who got an opportunity and came down with some problems
2284406 ive been pitching this year like it was the ninth inning like i was the last man standing
2284407 thats given me an edge to get the job done pitching in the ninth thats pressure no doubt in the eighth you know theres someone behind you to pick you up if you fail in the ninth youve got to close the door
2284408 im going to leave my arm on the mound one day
2284409 im going to turn around pick it up and say lets go but thats what its all about when youre playing for something special you never know when youll get to that spot again
2284410 its in the past he apologized and we moved on he was upset that he gave up the grand slam upset that he put those men on the bags he reacted improper and he realized it
2284411 i told him thats disrespectful no doubt by throwing the ball thats not nice youve got to admit you messed up and didnt get the job done youve got to take your lumps like a man and walk off like a man
2284412 i think hes got a lot he can offer us
2284413 i think youve got to be a little bit more careful
2284414 im going to look at the guys that are available and piece together whatever the starter leaves to the best of my ability
2284415 there isnt anybody in that bullpen that couldnt pitch the ninth inning in my opinion
2284416 my slider thats the first thing thats going to go when you get three or four days off
2284417 they told me to throw a lot of sliders and get it back to where it was its back
2284418 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2284419 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2284420 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward

2284426 exports many of the procedure and syntax bindings that are traditionally associated with scheme
2284427 so programs cannot rely on the hash function being called for every lookup or update
2284428 the search for the hash entry for both the ref and set
2284429 this may be a little hairier in larceny because of the gc handling
2284430 exports many of the procedure and syntax bindings that are traditionally associated with scheme
2284431 a lack of sensitivity to some of the profound historical and racial issues we have to understand theres nothing funny about a noose theres a profound history that people have been dealing with and those memories are ones that cant be played with
2284432 should have come immediately and repeatedly not two days later
2284433 i dont want to hear that the golf industrys biggest problem is something kelly tilghman said if golfweek really wanted to examine racism as the editor said he did they would look at golf and country clubs excluding jews and black folks look at their restrictive policies and explain why the only black folks you see at most clubs are working in the kitchen just like it was 100 years ago
2284434 it was a bad choice of words but the guy from golfweek fired editor dave seanor let him get barbecued that was a major mistake on his part putting the noose on the cover was absolutely stupid that was throwing fuel on the fire why would you do that he knew better
2284435 unless tsvangirai has real executive power then the whole thing will break down almost immediately
2284436 there is no mechanism for this transition to be policed so who will tsvangirai appeal to if zanu pf break out of the deal once they have got their hands on some international finance
2284437 after several years of relatively flat achievement scores we are beginning to see a positive trend
2284438 schools now have three years of grade level data for grades 3 through 8 to inform the development of their programs over time
2284439 the meas are not about trying to show how well we are doing
2284440 they are a tool to help us assess how we are doing for better or worse we are working to assess why the results were inconsistent and how we can adjust the assessment in the future so that we can use it yearly to assess progress in writing
2284441 woo team edward i love the books and its a great way to see other kennebunk kids who are obsessed
2284442 its great for borders to throw a party for all the fans of the awesome twilight series
2284443 its a neat way to meet new people who love the same thing you do
2284444 coming from a generation where technology infiltrates so many aspects of our lives its really nice to see that enthusiasm for reading is still alive and well
2284445 i cant believe how many friends i have made just through this series
2284446 not to mention the friends i already had and converted to loving meyers books
2284447 its nice to know there are so many fans as dedicated to meyers clean creative and addictive treasures
2284448 we are going to be moving toward a much riskier job market for everyone especially people at top of the food chain
2284449 people need to batten down the hatches have their r sum s ready and be prepared for the worst
2284450 people need to be strategic and decide the three things to do that are most important
2284451 thats about as many things as you can do extremely well in your job if youre being asked to do twelve things extremely well this may not be a job at which you can be successful also position yourself so you are connected to revenue generating or cost reduction areas if its hard for someone to quantify what they do their job may be in jeopardy
2284452 you have to manage your reputation by networking internally and externally
2284453 as times get more difficult were going to find out a lot of organizations dont have
2284454 six to eight months ago he told the ceo that the company was overleveraged
2284455 stan oneal paid him back by firing him you have to assess whether youre in a culture where your values are aligned with the companys values
2284456 if im buying i want to be buying really soon here
2284457 interest rates are still low we dont know where the bottom will be but why wait until the last minute if youre going to stay in the home for a while whether you pay 200 000 or 211 000 over the next 30 years is not going to make much of a difference
2284458 part of it is because these projects require a smaller outlay of cash 10 000 to 20 000
2284459 the projects take a few days to a week or so and the financing is generally provided by the contractors
2284460 these projects involve low or no maintenance products such as vinyl siding or windows
2284461 theres also the energy efficiency component people have that on their minds with rising fuel costs
2284462 i ask people to recite their expenses and they know what their house utilities car and phone cost but vacations are a black hole they may be spending 4 000 to 5 000 a year and its not budgeted for its also not normal for clients to have a clothing budget
2284463 make sure you have sufficient liquidity to weather the storm so you dont have to sell a long term portfolio at the worst possible time
2284464 i always get nervous when people look at their long term portfolio and say i can always sell that
2284465 even though they sound stodgy cds are a good thing
2284466 they outperform the other alternatives like bonds in the short term
2284467 the simple advice that nobody follows is to keep buying
2284468 most people end up selling in a downturn they try to time the market and they miss the upturn if youre looking at a long term strategy it doesnt matter whats going on in two to five years whats important is whats going to happen in ten to twenty years
2284469 larger caps will tend to outperform smaller caps because in any recession people get nervous about small caps
2284470 you cant go wrong with basics and vices people will always eat and drink and smoke thirdly if you havent diversified out of the country now is as wonderful time to do so you can buy an or a good mutual fund that specializes in international investment
2284471 the stock market has always gained in the long run so why not buy as many shares as you can when the prices are at their lowest it may not be for 10 or 20 years when the prices go back up but when they do since you have bought in at lower prices you stand to gain more per share
2284472 people dont think of depreciation as an out of pocket cost but it is
2284473 theres a steep drop off in value in the first year and 30 percent depreciation by the end of the third year
2284474 the first year depreciation on the new car is 14 000 if you bought a two year old model the depreciation is 3 000 in the first year of ownership
2284475 i worked as a mechanic 30 years ago and it wasnt unusual to overhaul the engine at 75 000 to 80 000 miles
2284476 they dont make them like they used to and thats a good thing the line between best and worst is pretty thin these days
2284477 the vin can also let you know any outstanding recalls that need to be taken care of
2284478 thirty to forty percent of recalls announced never actually get fulfilled
2284479 you dont get the bargains in certified shopping because they try to turn used car buying into a new car experience
2284480 you dont need a mechanical inspection of a vehicle and they give you a guarantee that makes it simple but you will pay extra
2284481 theres quite a bit of flexibility to search for local cars and work with a seller in terms of inspecting it beforehand people are also buying cars and having them shipped without a whole lot of fuss there are usually provisions if the vehicle doesnt live up to the description
2284482 if the wheels arent turning youre on a platform skidding forward
2284483 with abs you can continue to steer its a huge development in safety
2284484 its appalling how little attention people pay to the pressure in tires
2284485 you begin to compromise safety at 5 percent below recommended pressure fuel economy is compromised immediately and the tire wear is increased
2284486 i dont want to get married ever to anyone you understand that i want to do what i want to do
2284487 you wouldnt mind living in the nicest house in town buying your wife a lot of fine clothes a couple of europe you wouldnt mind that would you george
2284488 most managers compensation packages depend on beating the s amp p 500 or some other large cap index
2284489 if youre in october and youre well ahead of the s amp p 500 you know if you can hold on youll get a nice year end bonus its incentive to make the portfolio look progressively more like the s amp p as the year goes on to preserve the margin by which youre ahead
2284490 there are countries around the world which do not have a so tax loss selling is not going to play a part in those countries stock markets and they too seem to have the january effect
2284491 youre not making a bet on the market but on relative performance and it has the least amount of commission
2284492 when youre talking about accelerating deductions you need to be sure you understand what your amt situation is
2284493 once youre into the amt additional deductions in those areas are of no benefit to you
2284494 its a nice way of avoiding income tax on your distribution
2284495 if someone is on track to make 1 000 a month in retirement that extra 1 percent means theyll end up with 800
2284496 that 200 is very meaningful to somebody who needs food or medicine
2284497 the complexity of the choices presented to participants when deciding to participate in a 401 k plan already represents a barrier to enrollment overwhelming participants with even more information could discourage participation further
2284498 one of the hallmarks of the current 401 k industry is to give people a perception of disclosure
2284499 they swamp people with colorful brochures and bells and whistles that get everyones attention but have nothing to do with providing a secure retirement its financial fast food it looks good but theres not a whole lot of substance
2284500 a plan sponsor can go into a bank and say we need a 3 million operating line of credit to survive this year
2284501 the smaller the plan is the more apt they are to be paying higher fees and possibly egregious fees
2284502 they usually arent as well serviced because of the asset base
2284503 you may have a small machine shop owner who will spend two hours a year looking at the plan
2284504 also there are a limited number of places you can go usually insurance companies are highly active in that marketplace and tend to have lot higher fees because of kinds of products they are offering
2284505 the law requires the participant to know if the return is sufficient to justify the cost
2284506 anyone can negotiate a firing you do not need an attorney
2284507 getting fired what to do if youre fired downsized laid off restructured discharged terminated or forced to resign
2284508 do not threaten scream or be sarcastic and do not admit anything
2284509 show that youre upset in a calm respectful way listen to what they tell you and then ask them to put it in writing
2284510 decisions are made by a person in a pocket of power or profit not hr
2284511 fired downsized or laid off what your employer doesnt want you to know about how to fight back
2284512 my boss was furious at me for having the gall to request these things because he felt he was giving me severance by allowing me to stay on for thirty days
2284513 but i stayed professional and i didnt walk away empty handed
2284514 i spoke to others who had been laid off in previous downsizings so i knew what they gave other people in senior management
2284515 i stressed what had been accomplished over my tenure appealed to the loyalty and commitment i had given to the company and discussed the length of time it takes for someone to get a senior level job in my field
2284516 i had an who had four deals in the works and the company didnt know why he structured them the way he did
2284517 or maybe youre a critical witness in an upcoming lawsuit
2284518 i like to take cases when people have been fired on january fifth and bonuses come out on the fifteenth
2284519 if you are a minority a woman pregnant over 40 had a disability or believe you were fired because of a religious conviction you can always use that as bargaining position
2284520 i had three clients in who had a combined seventy five years service with the company
2284521 they were marched out by an armed guard through the employee cafeteria during lunchtime if the way you are treated does harm to your reputation now is time to raise that
2284522 tell them if you have two kids in college a mortgage and a sick husband to take care of
2284523 i had a client who was going through several cancer operations and needed more time to convalesce and someone whose daughter was very ill
2284524 shoot for one month of pay and benefits per year plus payment for all accumulated sick days and vacation days and any outstanding bonuses and commissions
2284525 if you are close to vesting in a pension or profit sharing plan ask them to keep you on the payroll until you qualify
2284526 outplacement is useful for people who havent looked for job in a long time
2284527 i had a client who was a vice president for information technology at a university and hadnt looked for job in fourteen years he had to figure out his strategy how to market himself how to answer interview questions and the kind of culture he wanted to work in
2284528 severance should help you move on to a better place
2284529 i once got a seventy year old female publisher the tuition to get an mba because it fulfilled a dream and goal and put her in a better place in life
2284530 if you smell a pink slip coming ask for it now
2284531 its better to volunteer to leave because the early bird often gets the worm
2284532 i was just numb i couldnt believe this could happen
2284533 i told the bank you know nobody is supposed to take a government check but they did i couldnt sleep at night i couldnt eat i thought why are they doing this to me when i was trying to pay my debt
2284534 people can really bumble around for months trying to get their accounts unfrozen because the procedures they have to follow are so byzantine
2284535 they zapped both her savings and checking and she didnt have access to any funds
2284536 she came over from the pharmacy in an absolute panic
2284537 every time the first of month rolled by and chase couldnt debit its 45 cents they charged her another 30
2284538 the banks say they have the right to charge fees because its a deposit agreement
2284539 they say they are not acting through the legal process but through a contractual agreement so the regulatory exemption doesnt apply to them
2284540 creditors used to have to have some reason for thinking someone had an account at a specific bank
2284541 when a sells off a debt they dont sell it with a red flag that says we tried to collect and shes on its sold as part of a bundle of debt we have cases where the debt buyer froze the account three times in a row on a client who is homeless and mentally impaired a judge ordered them to stop and they still did it
2284542 that would simplify things for the banks and essentially effectuate the whole purpose of what congress wanted to accomplish with exemption laws
2284543 they keep trying but i wont bite i even got one from
2284544 many of our clients made payments for years until they couldnt do it anymore
2284545 some of them did pay them off if you looked at what they actually charged outside of late fees and interest 212 comments showing comments 1 5 of 212 mis out spoken sunday may 11 2008 11 31am et 5 5 this is good for our young people to read and actually think about their finances how important it is to learn how money work how to handle the money that god have allowed us to have as long as we put god first and follow his rules lean on god to guide and direct us we cant be guided in the wrong direction we need to become more educated and stop the maddness of those insensative spinless greedy creatures on start talking care of one another and gods kingdom as he commanded god bless yahoo finance user thursday february 14 2008 7 05pm et 5 5 i too am disabled and have my ssi check direct deposited i was managing to pay my credit card bill just fine until one month my bill came and it was almost 4 times the amount of my normal monthly payment upon inquiry i found that bank of america had taken 100 cash advance from my credit card to put in my checking account which i had accidently overdrawn by 3 12 this unauthorized event caused my credit card to go over limit which raised my interest rate from 6 to 31 9 and it was also called a cash advance
2284546 a lot of people like how easy they are you can give without having to set up a and give to many causes rather than writing a check to one particular cause
2284547 if you know you want to give 10 000 to your alma mater give directly it doesnt do any good to put the money in a donor advised fund
2284548 but lets say youre getting to the end of the year youve had big capital gains and you dont want to pay big taxes
2284549 but you have no idea what causes you want to support and you want the time to do research or you know that in the spring youll be asked for a big gift the donor advised fund allows you to get the tax deduction this year and have money in the account and use it next year or over the next several years
2284550 some require more of a payout or some might require that at least a small percentage of a gift go to the sponsoring institution
2284551 if you live in green bay wisconsin and want to find out whats going on in the area of childhood obesity you cant call up fidelity theyre not going to know but you could call the green bay community foundation
2284552 a lot of times people will opt to give 15 000 in cash as opposed to looking across all of their assets and considering appreciated securities that they have held for more than a year
2284553 they can avoid paying capital gains while still receiving the deduction for the full 15 000
2284554 connects with a company emotionally understands what they need to do to add value and is willing to put in the extra effort
2284555 its the connection between the company and an individuals head heart and hands
2284556 the rest of the time was spent on things they needed to do to prepare to do the work they like
2284557 what happens is you are chomping at the bit because you are not doing what you like to do
2284558 most people say the smart thing is to do a job with as little thinking and effort as possible to cut corners
2284559 but if thats the attitude you take youll get bored and frustrated
2284560 its kind of counter intuitive because it means working harder is what makes you feel good but after a while it doesnt feel like working hard it feels the same as an athlete trying to beat the record
2284561 people who see work as a calling generally have significantly higher job and life satisfaction
2284562 professions that involve helping teaching and mentoring others are the ones that are highest in satisfaction
2284563 researchers who have done in depth studies of clergy say it is not only the actual practice but that they see themselves as doing gods work
2284564 we found some people who were incredibly engaged and find it deeply meaningful
2284565 they see their work as very important to the healing of patients
2284566 they notice patients who seem to be upset as they are in the room cleaning and will finish their work and double back to have a conversation
2284567 they will pay attention to whats happening with the monitors of cardiac patients and pick up on things that they think need to be passed along to the medical staff
2284568 if you are not engaged think about something you could be doing differently so you can change the meaning of the work
2284569 even a trash collector can see what they are doing as beautifying the community or making the world work
2284570 without that job the health of the community would suffer its crucial work and everyone is the beneficiary
2284571 we measured engagement first and then looked at financial performance in the ensuing thirty six months
2284572 dont assume employees are interchangeable cogs that if one breaks you can go out and buy another one they focus on the development of their people
2284573 it declined to about 10 percent in 2005 meanwhile womens time spent in home production hovers at 18 percent

2284576 im irritated about this and it was very inappropriate but its kind of hard to convey that without being a total bitch
2284577 they will not be taking each other to the prom

2284586 maybe its just my perception but it seems that democrats are involved in scandals more often than republicans
2284587 just like senator ted stevens scandal will not affect john mccain
2284588 highlands and islands airports limited and dundee airport are committed to working with airlines to develop new scheduled routes for the city of dundee and surrounding regions

2284596 it was foreseen that man would have to have the oyster therefore the first preparation was made for the oyster very well you cannot make an oyster out of whole cloth you must make the oysters ancestor first
2284597 that it took a hundred million years to prepare the world for him is proof that that is what it was done for

2284603 we members of the turkestan islamic party have declared war against china we oppose chinas occupation of our homeland of east turkestan which is a part of the islamic world
2284604 we do not want to see any muslim brothers and sisters who believe in allah and his holy prophet muhammad who believe in the next life and the day of judgment get hurt by our fire targeted at china
2284605 particularly go to the central chinese cities and kill the top leaders soldiers police prison wardens and accomplices
2284606 this is a treacherous and malicious accusation i am not guilty
2284607 if it is consensual why am i the only one charged
2284608 it is the dirty politics of a man who has lost support and very soon will lose power
2284609 the olympics have finally come to china and i wont even be here
2284610 its a rough life but beijing has been good to us
2284611 i should be happy for the olympics but im angry
2284612 these bosses can be so evil i dont think i will be coming back
2284613 the doctors told us they were all too busy preparing for the olympics
2284614 its obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position
2284615 we need to refine our processes and our practices and that is now happening as a result of this case
2284616 really hes been convicted in the court of public opinion due to the actions of the police and the media
2284617 to me it speaks of the importance of our relations with china
2284618 it reflects the solid foundation underpinning our relations it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2284619 well continue to be candid about our mutual global responsibilities
2284620 we must work together to protect the environment and help people in the developing world continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2284621 and theyre actually running out of time to be able to rectify it but we continue to press them
2284622 the bicycles that used to dominate the roads have given way to more cars
2284623 and then when you come to this magnificent birds nest the national stadium and the other architectural features that now dominate the landscape here there can be no question that china has achieved something truly special in readying itself to host these games it is just simply remarkable
2284624 people really are selling their talent in a way that can make them money
2284625 they really know that if they work with the government theyll benefit
2284626 he went from being this renegade making films that were banned and an eyesore for the chinese government to kind of being the pet of the government in some peoples eyes

2284630 it has become imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
2284631 an elected government was meant to bring stability unfortunately it is destabilizing pakistan

2284637 its sad that we could not forge consensus on the given time
2284638 the parties could not build consensus on the issues of portfolio of the new government and its common minimum programme
2284639 there were three or four friends with us also suddenly a santro car screeched to a halt beside the park and its three burly occupants pulled me and anubhav into the car inside they kicked fisted and slapped us brutally we somehow managed to fight our way out and used narrow twists colony roads to avoid being recaptured

2284646 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2284647 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2284648 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2284649 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2284650 i call upon the people of jammu to maintain peace and communal harmony and hold peaceful protests
2284651 the protests have been registered at top quarters and the channels of dialogue have been opened now it is time to shun violence
2284652 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2284653 we are still in the process of studying the documents no decision has been taken yet
2284654 there are some problems with the deal as far as non proliferation is concerned but we are still looking at it
2284655 it creates between the iaea and a non state npt party a new relationship in the area of safeguards and does not take up certain components of the npt such as global non proliferation
2284656 and india has come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club
2284657 failed in their core mission to narrow the gap between the economic performance of englands regions
2284658 at a time when businesses are increasingly over regulated and over taxed rdas have become a symbol of wasteful bureaucratic excess

2284665 created a significant incentive for people to delay the purchase of a property in the hope of avoiding the payment of stamp duty on the transaction
2284666 the uncertainty can only undermine the market further reducing the volume of transactions when they are already at historic lows
2284667 indeed we now have the worst of both worlds a potential delay in property transactions but with no definite proposal on the table
2284668 this uncertainty is a very very dangerous thing just to make a comment without backing it up in what is a very delicate market
2284669 although we have called for a stamp duty holiday i wish he hadnt said it
2284670 recent news stories suggesting the government has put forward a proposal on stamp duty are simply wrong these stories are based on speculation
2284671 as has been said on many previous occasions the government has made clear that there are a number of options we will need to consider to help businesses and people get through what is undoubtedly a difficult time
2284672 we have recently installed a turning area on the island side of the causeway to allow drivers to turn back when the causeway ahead is covered with water
2284673 we have also put up photo montages that show how dangerous it is to attempt to cross the causeway outside of safe crossing times
2284674 in the light if recent events we may have to consider the need for signs in other languages to be placed in the vicinity of the causeway
2284675 they dont think of original ideas and they dont bring much culture to their product

2284679 this final issue is a regrettable concession to the economics of the newspaper business and the particular travails of this company
2284680 how can people believe they are free when something as intimate as childbirth is so heavily controlled by the corporate state
2284681 of course we need freedom for families to make their choice among hospitals and home birth options
2284682 the artificial process of bringing on contractions then giving pain relief then bringing on more contractions then resorting to cesareans when things dont go as smoothly and quickly as desired reminds me of the spiral of interventionism mises described

2284699 acting with some bravery or some might say recklessness he looked at the gun and believing it to be an imitation he tackled the gunman
2284700 for his trouble he was struck several times on the head with the weapon
2284701 you got hold of that handgun to terrify the unfortunate shopkeeper
2284702 it is a pretty frightening looking weapon and it is impressive that he was able to form the view that it was not real

2284708 eating home cooked meals from whole in season ingredients obtained from the most local source available is eating well in every sense good for the habitat good for the body

2284710 the farmers markets are so affordable that i cant really justify planting a large garden
2284711 even though what the kingsolvers did was drastic just to make some small changes in our lives would make a difference
2284712 i didnt realize how much gardening and eating overlap each other
2284713 i mean im not willing to not ever eat an orange because it doesnt grow in our climate
2284714 i dont think our parents ever thought so much about what we ate
2284715 our children are eating way more processed foods than we ever did even though the idea of only eating home or locally grown items seems highly unrealistic i appreciate kingsolvers enthusiasm for eating local
2284716 we were very conscious this year to plant things that we all will eat
2284717 my kids love the cucumbers i was amazed my kids pick them and eat them right off the vine because they taste so much better than store bought

2284722 they the public do not have the same confidence they once had but does that mean we can return the sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must
2284723 if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us because the public will desert any sport in time that they are not satisfied has integrity in the way in which it operates
2284724 we are smarter than we used to be and we believe that as each month goes by we are learning more and were targeting our investigations are becoming effective
2284725 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2284726 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2284727 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2284728 right here he must have been pointing to my name in his phone book keith elder
2284729 yes that it cost him and that was just in fees not his travel and everything and the dog has to travel too
2284730 i did hear a good joke about the westminster today
2284731 well you know how a beagle won for the first time
2284732 well it was proclaimed a victory in the war against terriers
2284733 i cant necessarily attack facebook or myspace but i can attack their users all day long
2284734 dont put anything on a facebook account that you dont consider public
2284735 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
2284736 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2284737 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2284738 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
2284739 we think you should make a profile for yourself before somebody else does
2284740 just dont put anything there that you dont consider public and trust but verify when people want to be your friend
2284741 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2284742 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2284743 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2284744 everything has changed since katrina even our neighbourhoods arent familiar anymore
2284745 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2284746 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2284747 were hoping that at noon on the 29th everyone will sing say or shout we shall not be moved
2284748 lol i has found fun e catz on za intraznetz
2284749 it really does change their behaviour if they are confronted with the consequences of their actions early on
2284750 the dangers of what the liberal democrats are talking about today is it might give the impression to some young people that they can commit a serious crime and get away with an apology if its a first offence
2284751 a refreshing dose of common sense in the youth crime debate
2284752 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2284753 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2284754 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2284755 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2284756 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2284757 i was only 10 and like most boys of that age i hadnt travelled much and didnt know much either
2284758 from my bedroom or lying on the hearthrug in front of the fire i went off on my travels again and again
2284759 i know ill never be an explorer or a great footballer but i am quite happy as a politician
2284760 this scheme would have turned a green glade of heroes into a vast blasted chewing gummed piazza
2284761 there is absolutely no sense in londoners paying 18m from their already stretched transport budget in order to reduce capacity on londons roads
2284762 the mayor remains fully committed to the development of hydrogen as a cleaner greener fuel in london as indicated by the continuation of the programme to deliver 10 hydrogen buses and a refuelling facility
2284763 mayor johnson has just scrapped the biggest hydrogen vehicle project in this country
2284764 it is one thing for the london mayor to talk green but he is clearly turning into a one man environmental disaster
2284765 getting to the theological base as well as doing the political work with young people is the way forward for us
2284766 wouldnt necessarily hold views on foreign policy that are not identical to the government
2284767 i think if you have got groups that are actively promoting violent extremism groups that are on record as saying israel should be wiped off the face of the map justifying suicide bombing then i dont think it is right for ministers to be engaging with them sharing platforms and giving them credibility
2284768 part of the challenge is how do we ensure that those young people who are angry about injustice about poverty about all of those things how do we ensure that they can channel some of that anger through democratic means
2284769 thats part of my task to try and build the voices of young muslims of women to make sure that they have more representation in public life and they actually do feel that the democratic systems work for them
2284770 kate ellis has challenged me that if australia win more medals then i would have to wear their shirt at a uk event and if we won more medals she would do similar in australia
2284771 there has been a great sporting rivalry with australia and that will continue in beijing
2284772 its good to see that kate ellis is showing the courage of her convictions by having a bet with gerry

2284790 they bumped us off spots and were more physical and aggressive all night
2284791 usually the winner is the team that was more aggressive
2284792 when youre down 2 1 youve got to be desperate
2284793 you only have so many opportunities and theyre limited especially for me
2284794 im at the end of my career and i just feel like leaving everything out on the floor
2284795 and noticing the sensations as they ripple and resonate coming and going as they naturally do in this scenario while the pain is still there your perception of its intensity is less and you dont suffer as much through the process this works the same for our emotional pain
2284796 this was the perfect game for them to come in and try to steal one
2284797 i mean really hurting paul was banged up we had to leave everything on the court to win that game
2284798 it could hurt you but too much time off destroys your rhythm
2284799 we just didnt seem to be in a good flow it might have had something to do with the six day layoff we were just a step slow
2284800 monday is a crucial game for us the biggest of the year
2284801 we took care of business getting our first win on the road
2284802 the chief called and told me that me and my family had been absolutely and completely cleared of any charges he also said that he did not apologize for any action or wrongdoing by the police department although he did express regret about what has happened to my family and me
2284803 the delegation has in it mehbooba mufti farooq abdullah and saifuddin soz congress who are root cause of the problem here we refuse to talk to a delegation which consists of these people
2284804 we had earlier given our consent for the talk as we were not aware of the composition of the delegation
2284805 is now able to destroy their opponents attack and defense systems
2284806 its a completely different approach we have video specialists as part of the team so now there is this culture of the video statistic
2284807 its not a videogame at the end the player is playing in the end you are alone in the court
2284808 this is a human game so you cant go too far in this software direction because the player is not a robot
2284809 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
2284810 losing sean the way we did his life changed a lot of other lives
2284811 out of a season you take the positives and the positives were you had a franchise grow together you had a team come together you had a bunch of guys build love for one another and appreciation for one another thats the best thing that can happen in sports because of teams always changing teammates with guys leaving and guys coming its hard to grow and its hard to get used to guys but i think as a team this organization turned from a team to a family you found a lot of guys who developed a lot of love for one another thats the best thing that can ever happen out of a season
2284812 i was sitting right there in that seat looking over at agent zero helpless to do anything while they swept us out of the playoffs its been driving me ever since
2284813 deadly theres not anything you dont like about caron butler
2284814 i had to be more aggressive immediately i was the other guy i could concentrate on fitting in after gilbert set the tone or being efficient now antawn and i have to take a different approach
2284815 i realize those are words you dont put together brendan and dominant but he was dominant
2284816 blocked shots making it difficult securing the paint he is getting into a rhythm offensively going into defenders instead of stepping away it opens things up for me and for caron
2284817 because with gil we could get away with a lot that we cant now we cant cheat we cant be careless gils a luxury a lot of teams dont have and for three months we dont have him
2284818 debe ser uno pobre para conocer el lujo de dar
2284819 everybody spent the offseason and the early season talking about defense and i understand that
2284820 i believe in defense to the bone i played on teams that played great defense i coached on a team in new jersey that went to the finals twice and played defense but we know the strengths and weaknesses of this personnel and how to play a certain way
2284821 yes we have to have a commitment to defense and in the preseason we talked defense thought defense everybody knows it was defense defense defense but at 0 5 it was time we got back to what we knew we could do well
2284822 i said to the guys wow is this a trend or are we ahead of the game
2284823 gt gt i will not deny that many students in the
2284824 secondly the two types of school differ in learning opportunities
2284825 thirdly elite schools largely have a better reputation than neighbourhood schools because their students achievements have made them so
2284826 with regards to the claim that elite schools contain students with richer parents than neighbourhood schools i strongly disagree
2284827 there is not much to distinguish elite schools from neighbour schools

2284832 truly malicious software is going to find a way to burrow deeper into the iphones operating system so that a simple mechanism like this wouldnt affect it so really the only type of applications this could effectively kill off are applications that are annoying to apple but not malicious that certainly calls for a lot more concern

2284837 fakt ist auch da dieser gro e teil der muslime f r uns in zukunft ein sehr wichtiger partner in der politik und der ausgestaltung unseres lebens sein wird
2284838 denn wir wissen genau da wir nat rlich insbesondere in den ballungsr umen weiterhin alle anstrengungen unternehmen m ssen um unsere mitb rgerinnen und mitb rger mit preiswertem wohnraum versorgen zu k nnen dies gilt insbesondere f r die migranten

2284841 tore them down and built them back up which is sort of risky this time of year
2284842 i read them the riot act showed all the things they did wrong and the next two days we told them how great they were
2284843 as soon as the crowd chanted overrated he jumped to the moon to get a dunk
2284844 we can be a good ball club without gil this is how we did it its sort of a microcosm of how the season went
2284845 they came out with the right mind set at halftime they had outscored us 30 12 on points in the paint they had 30 points off our bad turnovers their guys were getting up in our chests and being very aggressive
2284846 by referees calls or hard fouls we stayed focused and disciplined
2284847 some are born great some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them and then there are others
2284848 i think itll be as crazy and hostile an environment as i have ever played in ever in my career
2284849 and i dont know how much of it will be personal i think me coming back will have some impact on how they handle themselves itll be interesting to see i was just told that fridays game 3 will be one year to the date of the game that i came back to play in last year talk about not being able to plan everything in life theres no way thats an accident im sure there will be a lot of emotion in the building that night
2284850 are you gonna play and he said im gonna give it a go i think i owe it to the people in utah because when i arrived here they welcomed my family and me with open arms i owe it to them to go out and perform and he made that huge huge shot and he just played his heart out and now the first time we go back there these people have the nerve to boo him it just set me off
2284851 to think about it now a year removed from what we experienced and what tatum went through how much stronger we are as a family how much better shes doing its amazing that that can happen in one year
2284852 it was a difficult thing to grasp or understand in terms of what was it that the fans didnt quite understand about our story as a family there were plenty of articles and stories about what took place and why when you hear about a family experiencing cancer or any serious illness there is no point to judge any professional move or personal decision thats made in terms of improving the quality of life
2284853 i got a letter from a lady who was our real estate agent in salt lake city
2284854 she and her husband treated us like family the year we were there she attached a newspaper article from one of the local newspapers that basically said it was the wrong time for jazz fans to boo she wanted me to know from her husband as well as from the writer and other jazz fans that those fans that were booing are not speaking for everyone in that community so it was good to receive some of that feedback
2284855 this conference is the first one thats really had children on the agenda
2284856 there have been more than 300 presentations dealing with children and aids
2284857 one of the issues that has been insufficiently addressed here is the question of adolescents who are hiv positive who are now at risk themselves for transmitting the virus and who may be growing up not knowing theyre infected
2284858 the good news is they are alive as teenagers the difficult problem is that this creates a whole new set of issues that we havent dealt with before
2284859 my new parents had my brother and i tested for hiv
2284860 my brother tested negative i tested positive so i was born hiv positive
2284861 when one woman is raped in africa by 18 men why should it take up to 20 years for criminals to be brought to justice
2284862 it should be headlines in every newspaper to say this is abnormal
2284863 i think if the general public were to be at this conference one thing theyd appreciate is the dynamic of having scientists talking to activists talking to practitioners and implementers
2284864 part of the strength of the aids response now is that theres a conference that brings together all these constituencies to see what really works in practice
2284865 telling me 11 months ago that wed be here man id think you were crazy
2284866 his team sits atop the most competitive conference race weve probably had in our history
2284867 im going to do something i really dont want to do give credit to mitch kupchak
2284868 sounded like they had to drag it out of him
2284869 its nice to hear hes happy with the group of players surrounding him its even more profound to hear he wants to be a laker the rest of his career
2284870 when he finds trust in you you want to be a better player
2284871 i see growth as a man outside of basketball and i think thats where the change has really happened having two daughters now having a wife i think basketball has become in its proper position in life so now its easier for him to be part of a team part of a group i think it makes it easier that he likes us all he enjoys being with us all
2284872 the first thing i said to them is you guys are ready
2284873 theyve grown into this from getting into the gym by themselves and working out working out hard improving their games not only getting ready for the moment but wanting that moment and coming to me and saying kob im ready for you to kick it to me and im going to knock it down those are the things i wanted to see and that i needed to see theyve made me look good by doing all the things theyve done by coming through in clutch situations making the right plays now people are looking at me like ive done something miraculous when theyve done all the work
2284874 i thank people for responding to the call for observing a complete shutdown on august 6 now people should resume their normal activities from tomorrow
2284875 people should act upon the programme announced by the leadership and not to resort to the strikes on their own which give an impression that there is no leadership and discipline among the people

2284895 the last drop in price was eight cents at the time we had 46 000 litres in the ground and until its sold off we operate at zero profit on our fuel but i can afford to drop the price because we have several stations
2284896 i feel for the other sites in cooma who cannot afford to do the same
2284897 it is a little known fact that the higher the price of fuel the less our margin is the majority of our sales about 85 per cent are on credit card and stations dont charge extra on the about 2 5 per cent merchant card fees
2284898 at about 1 60 per litre the merchant fee could work out to be about four cents per litre which is about 50 per cent of our gross profit margin

2284924 last of all he came to the wine and having learnt their way of making it he drank a draught which greatly delighted him whereupon he asked what the persian king was wont to eat and to what age the longest lived of the persians had been known to attain
2284925 it did not surprise him if they fed on dirt that they died so soon indeed he was sure they never would have lived so long as eighty years except for the refreshment they got from that drink meaning the wine wherein he confessed the persians surpassed the ethiopians the icthyophagi then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life and diet of his people and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old while some even went beyond that age they ate boiled flesh and had for their drink nothing but milk

2284927 one of the earliest and most convincing studies of the better efficacy of unsaturated than of saturated fat in reducing cholesterol and heart disease is the finnish mental hospital study conducted in the 12 y between 1959 and 1971 in this study the usual high saturated fat institutional diet was compared with an equally high fat diet in which the saturated fat in dairy products was replaced with soybean oil and soft margarine and polyunsaturated fats were used in cooking each diet was provided for 6 y and then the alternate diet was provided for the next 6 y 3 after a comparison of the effects of the 2 diets in both men and women the incidence of coronary artery disease was lower by 50 and 65 after the consumption of polyunsaturated fat in the 2 hospitals

2284929 studies on normal adults have shown that a little more than a third have significant fat accumulations in their livers even worse 15 20 percent of children show the same thing
2284930 could it be that during our evolutionary past the only time we might over consume carbs would have been when there was no meat available and we needed the saturated fat sounds reasonable to me
2284931 double bonds make fats unstable these double bonds are the places that free radicals strike to convert unsaturated fats into peroxides or oxidized fats the more carbon carbon double bonds a fatty acid has the more susceptible it is to oxidation
2284932 the point on a fatty acid that is vulnerable to oxidation is the point located between two double bonds so the vulnerability of monounsaturated fats which have only one double bond seems to be minimal

2284995 according to suskind the administration had been in contact with the director of the iraqi intelligence service in the last years of husseins regime tahir jalil habbush al tikriti
2284996 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 suskind writes
2284997 the white house flatly denied suskinds account tony fratto deputy white house press secretary told politico the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd

2285002 the voices that should be heard at this time are the voices of the people who have suffered most the people of darfur
2285003 there are 27 000 people in this camp all of them have fled villages that were attacked and bombed women suffered terrible atrocities many many men have disappeared
2285004 i think its appropriate since beijing has chosen to underwrite genocide in darfur
2285005 history will long remember the genocide olympics as such for many many months now beijing has made excuses for their close business partner in khartoum and failed to persuade them to stop their attacks on civilians
2285006 one refugee said to me those attending the opening ceremonies are not hearing our cries
2285007 this was a deplorable decision he wasted an opportunity to stand strong with the most oppressed people in the world and to hold sacred the values of our own country
2285008 at little cost he could have just skipped the opening ceremonies
2285009 really for beijing darfur was a low hanging fruit burma is a difficult issue tibet is complicated their own internal human rights issues are tricky but for darfur there was hope they would act
2285010 theyve chosen not to do that and to defend the perpetrators of this violence
2285011 does mr spielberg really want to go down in history as the leni riefenstahl of the beijing games
2285012 my time and energy must be spent not on olympic ceremonies but on doing all i can to help bring an end to the unspeakable crimes against humanity that continue to be committed in darfur
2285013 i too celebrate athletes and cant wait to see them do their thing

2285015 the situation in lebanon is worrisome and we are communicating our concerns to everyone including the americans
2285016 you can turn it around and say that irans foothold in lebanon via hezbollah now threatens israel
2285017 right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
2285018 instead of disarming this terror organization whose name hezbollah everyone here is afraid to even whisper the lebanese government now officially approves its military status
2285019 israeli over flights of lebanese airspace are a violation of resolution 1701
2285020 overflights are a clear defensive and preventive measure meant to counter violations that include unprecedented arms transfers from iran and syria through the syrian border to hezbollah in lebanon including in southern lebanon
2285021 such violations present real danger to the north of israel since no one stops the violations israel has the right and duty to defend its citizens

2285042 oh i dont need that itll all be too easy for me
2285043 for the last couple of weeks people have been calling me saying are you coming back to l a theyre talking about you and kobe getting traded for each other and im like sounds nice not nothing against getting traded but that would be a dumb thing on the part of the team who is accepting me because dont they know im going to be a free agent to all my friends at home who want me to become a laker if you have nba live 08 you can fantasy draft me because otherwise i dont think thats happening anytime soon

2285045 much of the recovery of new orleans is built around the saints
2285046 and i played for the redskins so i know how loyal people in the washington area are to the redskins but thats nothing compared to what the saints mean to new orleans the passion is unreal when we took the field i could just feel the hope from last year they wanted to explode to celebrate something and they left without having much to celebrate
2285047 i came down here expecting things to be pretty much back to normal since it has been two years since katrina
2285048 but i found that wasnt the case at all you run up on people all the time who are still hurting who have no house no place to go the thing they have is they all love the saints theres a desperation about it i tell people in chicago and washington that this is different its another level of loyalty what happens here brings life and hope to the fans and to the city you realize that were not playing just for ourselves its deep man as much as nobody in here wants to be 0 3 losing three games is a drop in the bucket compared to losing your home theyre still fighting this is a strong community with some kind of human spirit okay were 0 3 weve got to fight and demonstrate spirit ourselves
2285049 there might be a little bit of that but not as much as last year

2285090 but much of safe investment wisdom doesnt smack of excitement and large profit
2285091 its a horror story that gets played out in many different contexts and not necessarily with people who have millions
2285092 its the concept that whatever success they experience they expect to continue and doing things more conservatively is not as much fun but they do so at their peril
2285093 your money and your brain how the new science of neuroeconomics can help make you rich
2285094 its very important for people to realize that this is not a study by very smart people of how stupid the rest of us are
2285095 if you talk to the researchers they make the exact same mistakes that they spend their careers documenting
2285096 youll have a strong preference for one of those images and not the other because one is your mirror image the other is the image that people see when they look at you
2285097 whenever a stock an industry a market a country or an investing theme is familiar youll like it better but familiarity is very dangerous
2285098 he did invest in chrysler after getting a minivan but he didnt invest only because he liked the minivan he researched the stock if he hadnt liked what he saw when he researched the company he wouldnt have bought the stock
2285099 a small streak of random luck looks to us like part of a longer pattern of reliable foresight
2285100 if you see something once then twice you automatically involuntarily expect it a third time
2285101 you associate a signal with a result when i listen to that guy on cnbc and i do what he tells me i make money if that happens to you twice and if you see him again on tv dopamine is released and youll buy what he recommends because just seeing him will give you a good feeling the intensity of expectation really gets you into trouble
2285102 as soon as a stock seems to conform to a pattern that has made money before an i got it effect kicks in making investors feel sure they know whats coming next regardless of whether theres any objective reason to believe they do
2285103 because if you see the price it automatically has some influence on you
2285104 if owning stocks is a long term project for you
2285105 following their changes constantly is a very very bad idea its the worst possible thing you can do because people are so sensitive to short term losses if you count your money every day youll be miserable

2285116 these guys winter hiked a lot while they were camping they heard the sound of someone crying and shrieking and didnt know what it was all they could imagine was that it was a bird but there were no birds to be found
2285117 their history is what makes those spirits alive the people who originally built these places and brought them to life their stories are already part of the land waiting to be rediscovered by families and children

2285143 ive been getting a few text messages asking who writes my scripts but i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can and im just playing the game that i love
2285144 ive been getting to know more about the players and how they operate and thats come on in leaps and bounds in the three or four days ive been in charge
2285145 its given me a really different perspective and now when they are batting i really want them to do well for me and for the team its more of a holistic type of thing which is great
2285146 more than me getting a hundred i really wanted steve to get a fifty today and an even bigger score
2285147 hes deserved it after being away from the game for six months to see him back and smiling and laughing the cynical little man that he is its great its lovely to see him back
2285148 another day of doing the simple things as best i can and doing them right
2285149 you just have to go and bat and make sure you try and score as many as you can all the nonsense that happened before the game the scrutiny and the attention youve got to get on with it but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday and knew the cricket was on the way
2285150 you have to do the press conferences and live the life but the cricket is what i love
2285151 before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work that i normally do i just have to give that extra time and responsibility to the other players to build their confidence and speak to them which i dont mind it just keeps me involved a little longer at training
2285152 if i am having a good day today or yesterday was a good day then it was a good day
2285153 ive had lots of bad days but ive had a lot more good days than bad days so far in my career so ill just keep doing what i normally do but its probably no surprise that i keep improving because i wake up every single morning trying to get better
2285154 i think we can learn a lot about how people respond to crisis and the sustainability of communities by studying ghost towns
2285155 i think they are important reminders that we are not invincible there are far more communities in canada that have collapsed throughout history than there are communities that have survived
2285156 many communities in b c were barely around for a single generation
2285157 these peaks indicate its not a random process which would also suggest that community sustainability cant just be determined by environmental factors there are likely major political or economic events contributing to community abandonment

2285212 jackie hated these films and vowed never to come back but he did and he established a great career
2285213 the bigger reason for rumbles success is that at the time hollywood action movies had become extremely boring and formulaic
2285214 good question i guess with bollywood the mix just wasnt right
2285215 the balletic action sequences of hong kong could just be used more readily to retool existing hollywood cinema
2285216 the other factor is the great mainland china art movie whose saturated colours and art direction i really admire
2285217 no it was just serendipitous we started work on this four years ago but very quickly thought about using the first emperor legend and the notion that under the great wall of china there was another army that had been buried an evil one that might come to life
2285218 jet and jackie are both getting old there needs to be a new generation of chinese movie stars and some new artistic influences
2285219 i look at some hong kong directors particularly people like stephen chow and see that they have a future in the us hollywood isnt done with china yet
2285220 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2285221 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then claimed he was just joking
2285222 it has created a great world base for basketball and you will see 16 years later this will be the most competitive olympics ever until the next one
2285223 its something very special for us but more so for our parents
2285224 but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2285225 its a provocative thing to get people to read our crime prevention information
2285226 for me its not just about creating a flavour but bringing out the culture behind a dish
2285227 for any one dish there may be hundreds of molecules that give it its defining taste and aroma i select the most essential of these molecules then decide how much of each to use
2285228 in class we had to memorise the characteristics of about 600 molecules
2285229 but in practice we usually use a palette of about 200 molecules to create different flavours
2285230 flavour creation is a blend of science and the arts we need to possess the scientific knowledge that allows us to understand how different molecules react but blending them to get a flavour thats true requires a certain artistic intuition
2285231 when my colleagues tried the flavour most of them said oh this is good but one of them said i can smell the snow and that really made my day
2285232 every time she had to cross a muddy patch on the ground her male friend had to carry her
2285233 now i just get them from a market on the mainland
2285234 its really satisfying when people tell me you were the best part of my stay in singapore
2285235 when kobayashi walked onstage and the camera flashes started going off i thought to myself i must try cannot lose face
2285236 i felt stressed looking at zak but when i turned to my right i ended up looking at kobayashi which was even worse
2285237 i just tried not to think about the food and just kept stuffing it in and drinking water
2285238 many years ago there were more garment factories here but retailers now prefer to outsource their manufacturing to china or indonesia so you wont find many businesses like mine now
2285239 i always feel a sense of accomplishment when designers invite me to their fashion shows and i see how they have turned the pleated fabrics into a work of art onstage
2285240 i have to be very accurate when measuring the distance between buttons especially when the customer has specific requirements
2285241 younger people may not be interested because the work that i do can get monotonous and you need a lot of concentration
2285242 the cat is strolling in a garden and having a relaxing time
2285243 the older things get the more fun they can be
2285244 performers and designers come to me when they want something brighter bigger and more elaborate that will stand out on stage
2285245 maybe they admire my skills because i always give additional advice on the designs that they already have in mind
2285246 the basic thing among singaporeans is to secure enough income to maintain a certain lifestyle
2285247 they agree with the message that r amp d is the way forward
2285248 in their minds they have certain perceptions that what singapore needs now is talent in that area it is a result of messages theyve received from the mass media and government sources
2285249 singapore has no culture of political activism it is limited among our young
2285250 it is not so much because they dont think talent is needed here
2285251 they just feel this is not an area where they can fully develop their own potential
2285252 if everybody shies away from policymaking and government affairs then it is worrying about what it says about the young of this country
2285253 if our young are not passionate about politics then we are not creating future leaders
2285254 the saf chooses for the overseas scholarship young singaporeans with outstanding all round credentials character academic record leadership commitment to serve the nation and puts them through a systematic grooming process
2285255 with international projects i can get involved in the secondary level of creation because of a more skilled talent pool
2285256 if freelance actors want to get more famous and draw a certain salary they have to take on many projects including modelling jobs and not just focus on projects with quality
2285257 about 10 years ago parents and the government did not encourage singaporeans to become entrepreneurs but engineers and lawyers
2285258 it is vital that the game takes a step back and concentrates on making the right choices
2285259 we have the strongest and the most entertaining league in the world we should celebrate that not denigrate it
2285260 last season proved once again that as well as being the hardest league in the world to win its also the best
2285261 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league this year with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
2285262 i did not start the final of the uefa champions league with six englishmen because i was making a political statement i did it because theyre good enough to win the european cup
2285263 it is nonsense to say that england does not have players capable of competing on the international stage
2285264 daniel has constantly been experimenting with new things and is always on a lookout for new challenges
2285265 we believe that daniels veteran radio experience and aptitude for the radio business will bring forth a different perspective to how 987fm is managed

2285274 indian sport tends to be focused on events that are not included in the olympics most importantly cricket
2285275 they told me stop fooling around youll never be a professional race car driver dont dream about it
2285276 i enjoyed myself in the us but was definitely happy to be home
2285277 when i realised this i made sure i got a competition licence from the singapore motor sports association so there would be no confusion
2285278 i just got a new sponsor in corum watches for the porsche carrera cup its the first sponsorship that i secured on the basis of being singaporean
2285279 with the singapore f1 race coming up they know theres a lot of interest in motorsport here and they like the fact that im a singaporean whos going to race in singapore
2285280 ive downloaded the singapore track and it looks like an amazing high speed street circuit
2285281 none of us has driven on the track so itll be new for everyone theres no database at all well be going in blindly
2285282 i pride myself on being singaporean and would like to lead by example
2285283 the government is serious about promoting motorsport and i think people need role models kids want to identify with someone and obviously itll be nice if theres a singaporean for them to identify with
2285284 im extremely honoured to share the same track with them
2285285 obviously i feel nervous going in but as a racer these emotions have to be locked out once youre on the track these races will be a learning experience for me and will hopefully lead to a full season in the wtcc
2285286 ive been on the top step of the podium six times this year but they didnt play the national anthem at any of them
2285287 believe the way we believe and youre in if you dont believe the way we believe youre out

2285345 citizens pay the salaries of the mcso and have the right to question conduct of deputies and the use of tasers and guns
2285346 the crb should also be empowered to investigate the sheriff and his top staff as well
2285347 it appears to me that these issues are all currently addressed by the current structure in place within the sheriffs office
2285348 another layer of administration does not need to be added
2285349 as sheriff i guarantee i will personally review all complaints and investigations before they are closed if any citizen feels the investigation or results are inadequate they would be free to speak to me personally
2285350 but i do not think one is needed at this time
2285351 a crb is usually created when there is a pervasive perception that a law enforcement agency is not properly handling complaints against the agency
2285352 i believe the sheriffs office has developed a reputation among most citizens and the media as being extremely open and responsive regarding complaints and concerns our internal investigations have consistently been handled quickly and appropriately
2285353 in fact a couple of years ago sheriff roth had to hire a private investigator to investigate a complaint against capt peryam because he couldnt turn it over to peryams wife
2285354 furthermore roth had to keep the investigation secret to keep cindy from leaking it to her husband
2285355 and another example crb from page 1 recently surfaced a report from the florida department of law enforcement indicates that capt peryam may have leaked information about an fdle investigation to one of his deputies being investigated for alleged sexual activity with a 13 year old girl

2285357 both the real life adventurers and the fictitious heroes were advocates for the romantic cult of the individual

2285417 the time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to abrahams side
2285418 but abraham replied son remember that in your lifetime you received your good things while lazarus received bad things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony

2285436 i would love to go home again but i can not not until i retire
2285437 but its too leftist when we hire workers for four hundred pesos a day we have to pay a government tax for each one that is more than the salary we pay the worker in my opinion even though that is their retirement medical coverage and other programs that is too far left

2285445 he dosent expect to find any messages in any bottles in any sea but the despairing juan carlos onetti refuses to be alone he would be alone of course if it werent for the inhabitants of the town of santa maria sad like himself invented by him to keep him company
2285446 onetti has lived in madrid since he came out of prison the military rulers of uruguay had jailed him because a story to which he had given a prize in a competition he was judging was not to their liking
2285447 hands clasped behind his neck the exile contemplates the damp stains on the ceiling of his room in santa maria or madrid or montevideo or who knows where from time to time he picks himself up and writes shouts that only seem like whispers
2285448 the basic teachings of shia islam are that every person should strive to be a manifestation of the mercy of god and should promote brotherhood among all people one of the most key teachings in all religions and in shia islam is
2285449 the only case when force is justified is defensively to repel aggression our basic obligation is to spread brotherhood mercy and justice and sometimes resisting obstacles requires force
2285450 each person should strive to be a manifestation of god and gods love for all human beings this is how you grow closer to god our obligation is to go to whatever lengths we can for the well being of others make yourself an expression of divine love in relation to all other beings
2285451 this is put into practice again and again in the history of shia islam

2285458 with one of the most extensive powertrain upgrades ever for ford by the end of 2010 nearly all of fords north american engines will be upgraded or replaced
2285459 the cost to do advanced gasoline engines is actually more reasonable from an investment standpoint than running willy nilly into hybrids hybrids still have an incredible price premium
2285460 its not been often in the past that weve been able to say that
2285461 this is without question the best ford lineup weve ever produced and it comes at a critically important time for the company
2285462 our product led transformation is well under way and there is much more to come
2285463 we are committed to being the best or among the best in fuel economy with every new ford product in its segment

2285473 muchas veces se tiene que pelear contra el estudio el tiempo y el dinero y en algunos casos esta presi n se lleva al set
2285474 creo que hellboy ii es autobiogr fico en muchas cosas estoy de acuerdo con el villano y su impresi n de la humanidad aunque desapruebo sus m todos creo que se est destruyendo a la imaginaci n y un mont n de cosas espiritualmente importantes a cambio de cosas materiales y desechables adem s la relaci n entre liz y hellboy est salpicada de momentos que me han sucedido evidentemente nunca he peleado contra un monstruo vegetal de cuatro pisos de altura pero si hay cosas tanto en la primera como en la segunda pel cula en las que creo firmemente
2285475 la mayor diferencia para m es que hellboy i es el estudio de un s per h roe de mente adolescente y con un acercamiento unidimensional a la pelea como medio de expresar su gusto por pelear m s que el deseo altruista de ayudar en la segunda liz y hellboy viven juntos y no les va bien as que durante el resto de la pel cula hellboy trata de comprometerse emocionalmente mientras sigue siendo un s per h roe este fue el verdadero reto de actuaci n agradezco trabajar con un director a quien le importan m s los peque os elementos humanos que otros aspectos que se ven en estas pel culas de alto presupuesto
2285476 seth macfarlane es un tipo muy ocupado tiene su propia productora de dibujos animados family guy y american dad no cre que aceptara participar el productor sugiri intentarlo y le mandamos el gui n le encant y vino a colaborar con nosotros durante varios d as que fueron divertid simos pude compartir muchas cosas con l como fan pienso que es un tipo con un talento vocal impresionante con danny elfman la idea fue similar la m sica de hellboy ii deb a ser un homenaje a las pel culas que vi cuando era ni o principalmente las de aventuras creadas por ray harryhausen la m sica de estas pel culas era de bernard herrmann y yo sab a que elfman era su fan pens que le atraer a la idea tuve una junta con l y fuimos afortunados de que aceptara es una de las personas con las que m s congenio a nivel de trabajo
2285477 me siento muy cercana a liz desde la primera pel cula tuve que crecer con ella y ahora es mucho m s fuerte sin embargo no puedo imaginarme traer el apocalipsis al mundo para salvar al hombre que amo por otro lado con gusto dar a mi vida para salvar al mundo pero no imagino poder dar la de quien amo si alguna vez lleg a sentir ese amor en mi vida espero no tener que tomar esa decisi n porque lo escoger a a l probablemente y entonces lo lamentar a mucho porque todos ustedes estar an muertos
2285478 es importante recordar la falibilidad de la humanidad o mejor dicho que todos la cagamos en alg n momento los actos de los personajes de hellboy no son infalibles y esos momentos son los que definen a las personas
2285479 me conecto mucho con abe y ahora tengo m s tiempo para explorar otras facetas de su personalidad especialmente mi parte favorita de la historia la rom ntica como cuando me enamor por primera vez y lo est pido que fui entonces de tanto interpretar personajes fant sticos ya me siento uno a muchos no los podr a interpretar con mi rostro as que he escogido ver las cinco horas diarias de maquillaje como una bendici n en vez de una carga viendo el resultado que se consigue finalmente
2285480 evaluation in eureka school the school does not believe in failing and grading children and so will not conduct exams to test the learning levels of children we will instead have activities that test in directly whether they know the concepts doing the activities will itself show what the children know and dont know some written activity worksheets will also be used for this purpose the purpose of the testing is not to grade the children or to tell them how poorly they have done it is rather to identify weak areas and to help them improve in these
2285481 i think this team should go down as one of the best teams in the history of college basketball
2285482 not as the most talented and not on style points but because they encompassed what the word team means they did it the first year with no expectations then they did it again with all the expectations
2285483 we believe the word team is overused in corporate america a team is more than a group of people working together to be a real team there must be a team spirit with each person genuinely caring about his or her teammates success teams that win have chemistry and synergy with members focusing on doing their own job well and assisting others whenever they can a successful team is consistently fighting and winning battles over selfishness a difficult and noble feat to achieve lets face it we all have our personal agendas to surrender our individual ego to the good of the team takes work sacrifice trust and courage
2285484 everyone knows that in most cases a lot of people are smarter than a few people

2285488 its an absolute offense to them and me when i read stories like that that are allowed to go to print absolutely unfounded and the newspapers have the liberty to take liberties with a man like me and call me racist when my entire life has proved exactly the opposite
2285489 it would be great if they would but as far as we know that is dead in the water

2285501 it sounds the best and the navigating system is the best
2285502 the fact there arent many blu ray players out there now doesnt meant that much to me because it is the future so i would rather focus on whats next
2285503 i think maybe there was even a sense that we would make a better album if we went out and hung out together first on the road
2285504 maybe even sowing some seeds musically that would get us more prepared to go in the studio rather than just going in cold it takes the pressure off from having to go in and make something cold
2285505 robert was really disappointed that he didnt merit a mention
2285506 the award was for the bands performance so he thought he should have at least been thanked
2285507 havent had the time because of the tour to concentrate on a whole album but we wanted something out that denotes the fact that the band is alive and taking this seriously
2285508 adding some of the brazilian rhythms to the soup to make the dish
2285509 the intention is to present the music like its never been presented before
2285510 i wanted to do it even better than done originally we have the worlds greatest players who studied every move the classic bands ever made
2285511 in a lot of ways yes weve advanced and a lot of ways no i got married to my lesbian partner how advanced is that in that sense its a very different world were not there yet but weve evolved enormously

2285522 arena is a definite return to riff oriented guitar rock
2285523 its supposed to make you reflexively pump your fist and wave a lighter in the air the concerts will be a straight ahead guitar rock extravaganza we cant afford the flamethrowers yet but well make up for it with aggression
2285524 no words can describe the emotions i feel all these talented loyal giving people

2285527 i was so sick as a child with asthma that i love to breathe i love to have my health because i fought for it constantly growing up
2285528 when i was finally able to get myself together in the 1980s with my first comeback crying thats when i really got my health together
2285529 some places where there are tall grasses where ill immediately have an asthmatic reaction so i have to be careful
2285530 i think about my songs like a movie conceptually and i build a song like a house so when i wrote about buddy holly i just let ideas flow out of me beginning with the line the day the music died that stayed in my mind for months then i imagined this whole rock dream several months later by the time we recorded american pie it was nine minutes long it became a hit because even at nine minutes it was well made
2285531 the smell of death still hangs on the honeysuckle vine
2285532 i could write a song about a bulgarian fan dancer if they give me an assignment
2285533 thats more about confronting an empty room with nothing in my head
2285534 i defy you to find me two italians as tight ass
2285535 before rap i always thought i was writing the roughest stuff around like rednecks
2285536 many acts will be original musical arab jewish ensembles and bands created especially for the festival in never before seen lineups
2285537 rocks from one end to the next that kind of attitude but with a different subject matter

2285542 his skin was peeling and he looks so thin and gaunt
2285543 he seemed too weak even to get out of the chair to cross the road himself he stayed in the store for two hours and wheeled himself around in the chair the whole time
2285544 it was not a film rooted in paddy chayefsky realism
2285545 were hoping to get together later this year to play and then we may have some news but i want it to happen badly
2285546 rod hasnt wanted to do it for a long time he didnt see the need in it but i think he really wants to now i mean were trying to get it together its just a question of schedules
2285547 i think that would be the way to go though not just to go out on tour itd be great to have an album
2285548 itll be great to see the guys and play and go back down that road again just for one night
2285549 protecting the legacy that we have built and cementing the rights to the trademark bad company for touring

2285552 we are happy to have resolved this issue working closely with state officials
2285553 we look forward to continuing a substantive conversation with minnesotans about senator obamas ideas to get america back on track
2285554 we will consider individual stories where they live and other factors to select a group that will reflect the enthusiastic supporters behind sen obamas campaign to change our country and get america back on track
2285555 in the past our advertising wasnt connecting with young people people werent clicking where we would like this way the kids can feel they arent doing what we want and still provide them with up to date information on presertive laden instant food products its pure genius

2285572 he hit the field running he was a full speed guy was a leadership guy from 6 a m conditioning if he picks up in the fall where he left off in the winter he could be a real difference maker for us
2285573 i think because of the evolution of the position our receivers may not be as productive as wed like them to be until about the third or the fourth game of the year
2285574 it may take them that long to really get in sync with curtis painter

2285757 1 no me preocupa que gane un retrasado mental sino los que por detr s lo sustenten suelen ser esos que se dedican al noble arte del manejo de marionetas
2285758 a tu amigo le preocupa que los lobbies o el gran capital presenten a un candidato suyo a presidente disfrazado de buen gobernante generalmente sucede al reves el gran capital se agrupa entorno al lider mas carismatico o entorno al que ha ganado las elecciones al dinero le interesa estar bien con el poder independientemente de quien mande
2285759 el apoyo de los medios de comunicaci n para ganar las elecciones se desvanece en la rc ya que la campanya electoral es corta gratuita y con igualdad de oportunidades para todos los candidatos

2285771 the last thing we want is a tenant that is not compatible or wont be successful
2285772 as the community around market street matures develops and and defines itself the tenant mix just changes
2285773 i think market street is still searching for its identity

2285786 we believe the word team is overused in corporate america a team is more than a group of people working together to be a real team there must be a team spirit with each person genuinely caring about his or her teammates success teams that win have chemistry and synergy with members focusing on doing their own job well and assisting others whenever they can a successful team is consistently fighting and winning battles over selfishness a difficult and noble feat to achieve lets face it we all have our personal agendas to surrender our individual ego to the good of the team takes work sacrifice trust and courage
2285787 everyone knows that in most cases a lot of people are smarter than a few people
2285788 o goed dan schrijf ik wel 10 uur op het maakt mij niet uit ik ben er toch niet
2285789 ik heb het doorgegeven hoor als het goed is komt het er zo aan
2285790 normalmente nuestro ritmo de carrera siempre es bueno pero hoy no ha sido as ya que he sufrido falta de adherencia nicamente al final la situaci n ha mejorado un poco pero no lo suficiente para ser competitivo
2285791 debemos intentar entender por qu este fin de semana no hemos podido estar a la altura de nuestros rivales
2285792 en ferrari siguen manteniendo la confianza en nosotros porque tienen la capacidad suficiente para salir de esta situaci n en la pr xima carrera
2285793 zie je me ik sta naast de tribune in de buurt van de rolstoelen
2285794 z gezellig dat ik zelfs te veel wijn heb gedronken
2285795 ik had er vandaag last van dat wil ik niet meer
2285796 kom eens hier je bent een beetje vies je hebt wat ei op je wang
2285797 wij willen niet dat uw kleine etterbak in onze showroom overal met zijn kleverige tengels aan gaat zitten met zijn ranzige poten op de meubels springt en zijn snot vrijelijk verspreidt over onze artikelen
2285798 waar ben je wil je zijn volgend jaar over 5 jaar
2285799 im sorry madam youre not happy so im not happy please shut the window
2285800 volgens mij heb je al in 6 jaar geen single meer gespeeld
2285801 ze hadden geen zin om netjes voor het kleine karretje te lopen waar een popje in zat
2285802 als ik gevat was zou ik nu een kwinkslag maken
2285803 je hoeft niet weg te gaan je bent toch haar moeder
2285804 uiteindelijk werd de redactie van het programma het zat dat ik alsmaar de peppers filmde hahaha
2285805 ik maakte toen een reeks documentaires voor de vpro ik had portretten van nick cave en john hiatt gemaakt en wilde ook een jong bandje via iemand van de amsterdamse platenwinkel get kwam ik bij de peppers uit het derde album was net verschenen en de band zou naar europa komen ik was niet echt kapot van hun muziek maar live waren ze geweldig ze waren energiek en hadden uitstraling
2285806 al die clips waren midden in de roos ze vonden het geweldig en waren zo verbaasd dat ze zich meteen van hun echte kant lieten zien flea vertelde later dat ze eigenlijk lol hadden willen trappen om mij in de maling te nemen maar dit werd een goed begin van de reis
2285807 ik had meteen een lang interview met hem in zijn bed eigenlijk nam hij me meteen in vertrouwen
2285808 afgelopen jaar op pinkpop liep kwam hij van verre aanlopen om mij te begroeten we mailen nog steeds maar ze hebben het tegenwoordig zo druk soms reageert hij niet eens
2285809 het vreemde is dat ik tijdens het filmen er nooit iets van gemerkt heb pas later toen je overal die drugsverhalen las kwam ik er achter dat het allemaal dealers waren die kwamen afrekenen bij de manager
2285810 het is wat ze in hollywood het all is lost moment noemen
2285811 in dat eerste interview vertelt flea dat de band moet groeien om te kunnen blijven bestaan dan gaat ook nog eens de gitarist dood vervolgens komt frusciante als reddende engel maar die stapt weer uit de band vervolgens stort de hele band in uiteindelijk zorgen vrienden dat frusciante naar een afkickkliniek gaat en hij keert terug bij de band het is een ontroerend verhaal
2285812 pas later hoorde ik van zanger kiedis dat hij kwaad was dat ik niet bij hem thuis had gefilmd maar in die periode kon je niet in contact met hem komen
2285813 nu pas zie ik dat de bandleden soms ruzie hadden tijdens de opnames
2285814 i know a twelfth one if i see up in a tree a dangling corpse in a noose i can so carve and colour the runes that the man walks and talks with me
2285815 you mustnt talk to the tribals or you will be blacklisted

2285817 when you go home tell them of us and that for your tomorrow we gave our today
2285818 at apple campbell is not just a board member hes also jobs friend and the two take regular sunday walks around the streets near their homes in palo alto where jobs says they discuss
2285819 john doerr partner at kleiner perkins caufield amp byers and one of googles vc investors suggested that schmidt google ceo might benefit from a session with campbell
2285820 for schmidt and others having a foulmouthed angel on their shoulder one who isnt on the payroll with no overt political agenda is a dream come true
2285821 it has been several months since i received your book and we exchanged emails i stated that i did not buy into the daily meetings i have since completed your book and am totally bought into the daily meetings we have implemented daily meetings for one of our dev teams with fantastic results we are now going to take them company wide with the full game plan as you outline it in your book daily weekly monthly quarterly and annual i was wrong
2285822 we implemented daily huddles following your sydney workshop in march we run a daily 848 a 12 minute stand up huddle every morning at 8 48 am the process ensures we align every day to achieving our weekly monthly quarterly 1 year 3 5 year and 10 year goals this alignment allowed us to dramatically improve our business strategy we no longer go around in circles as we have a direct flight path to commonly understood objectives finally we celebrate our wins something we never did previously
2285823 kijk naar de kiezer die ons in 2006 heeft gekozen
2285824 ik reed achter wim aantjes cda en deze had zijn linker knipperlicht aan om links af te slaan en wat dacht u dat wim aantjes deed hij sloeg rechts af
2285825 hee malou sorry maar ik kom vanavond niet daan belde me net of ik bij hem kom slapen want zijn ouders gaan ineens een weekend weg daar zeg ik natuurlijk geen nee tegen volgende keer kom ik weer naar jou en beloof ik je dat we gezellig een film gaan kijken oh malou nog wat mijn ouders mogen niet weten dat ik bij daan slaap dus ik vertel ze dat ik bij jou ga slapen dus mocht het nodig zijn kun je meespelen en zullen ze er niet achter komen dat ik bij daan ben geweest malou je bent een schat ik moet nu ophangen spreek je snel doeg
2285826 ja ik kom er zo aan even mn schooltas pakken
2285827 ja daar wil ik het nou net over hebben sita de laatste tijd ben je alleen maar met daan bezig je praat alleen maar over hem je verkiest hem boven mij door mij ineens af te bellen en je geeft mij niet eens de kans om te praten laat staan dat je naar me luistert je hebt me alleen maar nodig voor je leugentjes waar is onze vriendschap sita laat je die echt kapot gaan voor een jongen sorry sita maar als je je gedrag niet wilt veranderen kun je niet meer op me rekenen dan zoek je het maar uit met daan ik laat me niet langer aan de kant zetten
2285828 ben je jaloers of zo kun je het niet hebben dat ik een vriend heb en jij niet en het is zeker wel makkeiljk om mij de schuld te geven dat onze vriendschap is veranderd jij luistert anders nooit meer naar me je doet alsof dat heb ik heus wel in de gaten
2285829 vind je het gek dat ik niet meer luister je vertelt toch elke keer hetzelfde het is alleen maar daan daan daan en nog eens daan snap je niet dat ik daar gek van word ik krijg van jou niet eens de tijd om wat over mezelf te vertellen
2285830 je moet niet denken dat ik nu weer ga veranderen omdat jij dat van me vraagt
2285831 stomme ego st als het nog eens uit gaat met daan moet je niet denken dat ik er voor je ben

2285833 10 000 emails is equivalent in size to about 2 of moveons list when it first formed in 1998 and moveons list was built without help from partisan media
2285834 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum
2285835 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2285836 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2285837 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2285838 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2285839 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2285840 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2285841 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2285842 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2285843 la russie a bombard le port de poti sur la mer noire ainsi que la base militaire de senaki
2285844 nous pensons que les russes ont commenc bombarder les infrastructures civiles et conomiques

2285846 des v hicules blind s russes ont p n tr dans les faubourgs nord de tskhinvali
2285847 ce que la russie est en train de faire en g orgie constitue une agression ouverte et non dissimul e ainsi quun d fi lensemble de la communaut internationale
2285848 si le monde ne stoppe pas aujourdhui moscou les chars russes pourront entrer dans nimporte quelle autre capitale europ enne
2285849 nous demandons la russie de cesser ses attaques a riennes contre la g orgie de respecter son int grit territoriale et de retirer ses forces terrestres de ce pays
2285850 les russes ont commis une v ritable agression contre notre territoire
2285851 beaucoup d pendra de la r action des occidentaux resteront ils bronzer sur la plage ou donneront ils un signal clair la russie pour quelle ne franchisse pas certaines limites

2285854 debat over actuele stand van zaken rond project nieuw zaailand debatcentrum de bres organiseert een extra debat over het bouw en investeringsplan nieuw zaailand in het hart van leeuwarden het debat over de actuele stand van zaken wordt gehouden op dinsdag 15 april en begint om 20 30 uur
2285855 of course i have well you know its very interesting because at first im you know im unhappy about the way chinese are treating the tibetans because i dont think anyone should be unkind to anyone else
2285856 better condition than we hoped given the conditions at the crash site
2285857 monday night at home ready to do yardwork and priority private caller came up answered the phone and it was somebody soliciting on behalf of my deputies
2285858 i asked him where the split was coming from he assured me 100 percent of the money was going to fop 108
2285859 at this time the phone calls soliciting donations have been suspended
2285860 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident
2285861 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2285862 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2285863 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2285864 they were taking people out of there right and left
2285865 weve found a better suited location and no longer need city park
2285866 it will work out a lot better for them demonstrators
2285867 the potential for doing this kind of work is very exciting if we could try to re grow cartilage it would mean wed be able to help people with early arthritis of the knees and hips as a result of sporting trauma
2285868 most of the time you have to have a secondary operation on the hip bone and take some bone graft out and thats often more painful than the surgery for the actual fracture
2285869 enterprises are looking for application and data access in the mobile environment and its a natural progression of where business is going
2285870 we realized that as our own users have mobile requirements so do our customers
2285871 the mobile web presents one of the largest emerging market opportunities weve seen in a decade as billions of people look to access a wide range of services both for business and personal use
2285872 she has decided that she will need a few more weeks than originally planned to be ready for her return to the stage
2285873 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2285874 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2285875 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2285876 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2285877 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2285878 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2285879 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2285880 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2285881 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2285882 many motorists simply dont see their two wheeled brethren or when they do find them aggravating
2285883 a motorist and cyclist came to blows after the motorist berated the pedal pusher for ignoring a stop sign
2285884 the enraged cyclist used his bike to batter the motorists car until a bystander punched him
2285885 in los angeles it takes a special kind of road warrior to hop on a bike in the name of saving the planet and a little money
2285886 tensions between cyclists and motorists here have become dangerously combative
2285887 a lot of motorists think cyclists should get off the road
2285888 if they had been there they certainly could have died
2285889 i wanted me to feel that there was no hiding place it was a removal of layers rather than an adding of layers
2285890 between action and cut we were in a very protected private space in which we could be really vulnerable to each other
2285891 there were very gratifying moments when she would emerge from behind the camera in tears saying in a very quiet voice i dont want to do another take
2285892 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
2285893 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
2285894 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality
2285895 i did a film called sexy beast and i do know that that is my anger in the film you cant invent this i know that in schindlers list thats my revulsion an incomprehension that this could be happening to human beings i know that in house of sand and fog that is my perception of how a man should look after his family
2285896 the buck does have to stop here sooner or later
2285897 if i were really fortunate then i would be born into some mythology
2285898 but we can enter into shakespeares world and by his miracle and the language through him we can be back in ancient britain
2285899 i worry about cgi when it tries to replace the actors human experience
2285900 if i was to play napoleon and they said dont worry were going to cgi your army behind you id say no you wont
2285901 im rather fascinated by how greatness lets go how men let go kepesh lets go of the whole architectured existence and he demolishes it
2285902 the journey is what attracts me how a man changes
2285903 seriously folks dont burn your copies of the book return them
2285904 i think meyers fans would send a much more powerful message if instead of a book burning tour they staged a book returning tour
2285905 not only is this girl seriously melodramatic and clumsy shes the most weak willed and pathetic character ever written
2285906 she has said numerous times that she would simply die if edward ever left her its like her entire life revolves around him what are you trying to tell young women ms meyer dont girls have enough self esteem problems already should they really be reading books about a girl who has no life outside of her boyfriend a girl who readily admits that she would die if he were to ever leave her
2285907 i think most readers would have settled for maybe a surprise pregnancy at the end or something to that effect if meyer really wanted a baby in this story but the fact that it swallowed the whole plot just plain sucks
2285908 i was extremely disappointed with the fourth book i want my money back
2285909 this creepy anti abortion allegory quickly gets literal as the half vampire fetus starts killing bella from the inside out even as it breaks her ribs and sucked the life from her she proclaims i wont kill him but does she have to face the consequences of this choice no because vampire magic suddenly allows mother and father to hear the fetuss thoughts and to discover that it already loves them
2285910 as canadians we were able to play a role in initiating what is truly the modern petroleum age that has shaped our western life for the past 150 years
2285911 theres the drake oil well at the pennsylvania site that claims that and others that say theyre where the modern petroleum age began but we just happened to beat them to it
2285912 most people who do come through the door they say we had no idea what was here that there was even oil in this area
2285913 weve got an industry thats surviving as a cottage industry
2285914 the day may well come that we have to pump those wells and get every last bit of oil out of the ground it may not always be as liberally flowing as it has in the past and the oil has to be coaxed from oil wells of the planet and thats exactly what this system excels at
2285915 three tablespoons for instance is the work of a man for eight hours
2285916 if you look at oil in terms of the energy it has weve devalued it weve cheapened it so that we can commit the kind of folly we do in which we have a 4 000 pound carapace as a car which takes us to buy a quart of milk at the store
2285917 were the bunch that drilled the first well in the middle east for instance six people from petrolia drilled that well on may 26 one oclock in the morning 1908
2285918 i always kind of feel the most stressful race is the first race of the season and the first race of a regatta
2285919 the same holds true for the first race of the olympics its been some time since lausanne world championships crews get better its exciting to get that first race you know where you stand you know what to expect
2285920 when you get out on the water its very exciting
2285921 it bring it more to the front and centre you are here and you are racing
2285922 you train as best as you can to perform your best
2285923 you cant control how other teams do we come here to win medals but at the end of the day the best you can ask for is putting your best foot forward
2285924 for sure its a different atmosphere having no teammates here
2285925 i kind of miss that camaraderie but now that im here with all the different sports i feel a big part of team canada and once you get in the ring youre by yourself anyway so im used to that
2285926 i expect the climbers to make a lot of attacks but i feel confident and im looking forward to it
2285927 der goldene nazivampir von absam 2 das geheimnis von schlo kottlitz
2285928 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting those pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefit and pay in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation
2285929 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction
2285930 we couldnt be happier moving forward with our media rights with long time partner abc and now welcoming versus to the indycar series family
2285931 looking forward to 2009 and beyond we have the opportunity to team up with our media partners and really capitalise on unification and the three year indianapolis motor speedway centennial celebration
2285932 but sanaa hamni gets the chicks sorry mr a guy like me which pretty much prevents us from really getting the psyche of the target audience convincingly the original enjoyed some success but i expect the sequel will outdo the first it is simply the better film
2285933 though theres still enough ninny muggins in this particular vintage to call it a corked film
2285934 treads a lot of familiar ground while it explores the breadth of the leopards cant change their spots vs clothes make the man spectrum it seems that ive been screening of lot of films about disaffected youth but i may have enjoyed this one the most
2285935 by the time the horror setup is really in play
2285936 the film is well past half over and people arent dying near quick enough
2285937 my pipe business i created from scratch my media assets and bank i bought from the secondary market
2285938 you count all my assets and you never see any gift from kuchma the only gift i get from kuchma is my wife i am trying to be transparent but nobody likes rich people
2285939 i just want to participate in the building of my country

2285945 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2285946 its a great feeling to know that a song ive performed is on itunes
2285947 its great to hear kids come up to me at school and say hey that money in a card thing is really cool
2285948 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
2285949 many patients in india enter into clinical trials because they have no better option to receiving care
2285950 one of the major problems of clinical trials in india is that they are not publicized as clinical trials
2285951 physicians are attracted by inducements of foreign travel funds and fame of the four stakeholders the sponsor or drug company hospital investigator and patient three are on one side
2285952 why should we keep india behind everyone else why close our doors for business when we have the capabilities
2285953 since trials for foreign sponsors must follow international rules they actually help raise indian standards the experience with other outsourcing industries has also been that more business has brought better regulation and monitoring
2285954 companies spend resources to train people and bring in expensive equipment
2285955 over time as the overload from big institutes flows to smaller ones in second tier cities the benefits will spread farther
2285956 conducting clinical trials is not like landing a man on the moon
2285957 those who say it will enable india to develop cutting edge technology are talking nonsense
2285958 a little bit careful so as not to bring disrepute to the industry and country
2285959 dont you remember how the democrats and the media went after newt gingrich for doing the same thing as john edwards has now done now its not fair newt gingrich was put on the death row practically because he cheated on his wife who was sick with cancer and the woman he cheated with was much younger as is the case in the edwards saga
2285960 at least when democrats cheat they cheat with the opposite sex republicans usually have affairs or sex with members of the same sex
2285961 newt gingrich is perfect righteous and doesnt deserve any negative attention he slept with a woman too
2285962 theyre currently running a light hearted slice of life photo essay on a hamas terror training camp
2285963 it makes me sick to my stomach that someone actually is trying to glorify these cowards

2285975 we accepted the children based on appeals from their parents to have them placed on our scholarship scheme in monrovia
2285976 so it is unfortunate for the minister to term it as adoption
2285977 bank customers frequently and incorrectly equate significant drops in bank stock prices with safety of bank deposits
2285978 at a time when the economy is clearly under stress the commission has a responsibility to assure that destructive practices such as abusive naked short selling are stopped
2285979 based on what we are hearing from our members we suspect that the volume of fails to deliver has only continued to grow perhaps dramatically

2286024 the decline in the teenage pregnancy rate can be attributed to abstinence and abstinence education programs an april 2003 study in adolescent family and health found that 67 percent of the decrease in teen pregnancy rate among women between the ages of 15 and 19 can be attributed to abstinence
2286025 in 2005 the wisconsin state legislature passed a bill that requires all public schools that teach human growth and development to stress abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity and that abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases

2286071 dont change blogs now you idiot you think your fellow bloggers would have the time perhaps even the effort to change your goddamn url just for this blog yaya youre such a loser
2286072 my blackberry gives me the ability to fully stay in touch and be able to quickly respond which is fantastic
2286073 you dont have to go check your e mail at a computer you can be two states away and it still appears as though youre around the corner
2286074 not to mention the fact that this phone is so small that it fits in my shirt pocket easily so its very like carrying a stack of business cards
2286075 its where you get your calls voice mails e mails texts and you can respond all in one place
2286076 i started with the palm treo with windows and it was the slowest thing i ever worked on the ease of use with blackberry is far very intuitive
2286077 even though i was able to open lockboxes with the treo it was really cumbersome
2286078 it would sometimes take five to seven minutes which isnt so efficient
2286079 i can also use my blackberry to take fantastic photographs
2286080 any pictures i snap at a property can be immediately e mailed anywhere i even take pictures of my clients add them to my contacts and they become part of my caller display when they call me i see their picture and know exactly whos calling
2286081 or better yet when family calls i have their smiling faces looking at me which is a nice refresher
2286082 i start and end my day by that so in other words i have it programmed to automatically turn on at 7 in the morning and i have it automatically turn off at 10 at night
2286083 that helps me to go back and say im done for the day instead of a night of phone calls
2286084 the blackberry pearl is such a great not going back

2286087 whats great about china and whats shocking about china is that its the complete opposite of what we know were of europe were of latin america
2286088 youve got that culture shock going for you theres that honeymoon period of just being wow this is amazing then it sets in that you cant get things done
2286089 you feel sick your ears start ringing i have absolutely no lung issues and it was hard i dont know what the athletes are going to do
2286090 theres no way you can do it without an interpreter
2286091 in china theres a tradition called losing face so its very important that you never lose your composure and you never shed any bad light on the person youre dealing with
2286092 so if you have an issue with someone you always smile you never raise your voice and you try to resolve it impatience in china is seen as one of the most negative traits you can have
2286093 people dont stop for you they have crosswalks but cars dont adhere to them at all its just a suggestion get behind someone whos chinese who knows what theyre doing and just ride on their draft like lance armstrong
2286094 its so poorly serviced with public transportation i found beijing really frustrating because you would need to get into a cab to go anywhere but the traffic was so bad at all times across town would be an hour trip you get in a cab and you just wait
2286095 some people say that the airport system in china is only ok so if you can take the train you should one its cheaper plus you get to see the landscape its really wonderful to roll through those towns
2286096 beijing is probably where you could wing it because a lot of people are speaking english there and everything is written in english i remember walking into what i would consider was off the beaten path and there was english there too
2286097 i always bring a jar of peanut butter wherever i go and i brought cheerios because i knew i was going to have euphemism alert travelers dilemma there was going to be some stomach issue so whats the food you want to make you feel better i brought peanut butter and i brought cheerios you have to think about what foods going to bring you back
2286098 i was able to keep my composure about everything but this when you walk into a store in china a real bona fide store a clerk will just follow you the entire time shell be in your blind spot youre just looking and shell be right here as it was explained to me this is just good service it drove me crazy id try to lose them finally they would tire they understood dont take it personally but it drives you nuts its the one thing i couldnt be polite about
2286099 the commercialism is so in your face there its not my idea of communism whatever price they give you you want to knock it down at least a third i always have a problem with this but they expect you to bargain its part of their culture you never just walk away with that first price and then again always smile be patient be polite
2286100 this was one of my biggest disappointments and this happened to me a couple of times id be in a tea house not a touristy house at all and i was given lipton tea in a bag
2286101 the tea houses are where theyre enjoying life just be a part of that you can really sense how this culture which is thousands upon thousands of years old has evolved to what they are today
2286102 they stick this long skewer in your ear and youve never sat so still in your life

2286105 you have to work like a dog just to live like one now
2286106 protecting the environment in our daily lives also know as going green has become something that is on everyones radar these days even when it comes to kneeboarding
2286107 after checking out the credentials of carbonfund org and its verification certification process and finding out how easy it is to reduce our climate impact it was a no brainier i encourage individuals and all other sport disciplines to consider doing the same

2286114 this is really a slap in the face to all the people who put in small amounts of money to fund the advertisement and so i guess theres a range of options at this point
2286115 people are just totally disgusted that anybody would do that
2286116 its like taking a bucket of spray paint and spray painting the mona lisa youre destroying a work of art
2286117 they pulled them and bashed them they stomped on some they pushed them over to us it was just vandalism at its worst
2286118 people who are involved in this competition work too hard to ever want to see them destroyed in that way
2286119 weve been facing hardships now for two years we have almost folded several times
2286120 our gate take had just been picking up for the month of july and we thought oh my god were going to make it and then this happens to us
2286121 any time we can stop a criminal enterprise carrying on by taking away any of their assets is a good thing
2286122 you might as well paint a target right on them
2286123 what scavengers are doing is negligible in the grand scheme of our garbage program
2286124 we will not chase certain types of violations this is one of those situations
2286125 this kind of policy does not give the residents a lot of confidence that police will protect us
2286126 it kind of says were wide open the police cant chase you
2286127 we need to balance the safety of the community against a stolen tv
2286128 if its a safety issue that a car pursuit is dangerous to other traffic and residents then i can understand that
2286129 on the other hand weve had so many burglaries over here when you catch someone id think theyd have some foresight
2286130 given that there was a break in and police witnessed it i think police should have pursued
2286131 you dont want a high speed chase in the middle of the day
2286132 now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and id like to take a minute just sit right there let me tell you a story about how i became the prince of a town called bel air
2286133 we are pleased to have secured space in palo alto for up to 40 lawyers
2286134 the new office will expand our presence in the bay area and enhance our ability to serve our current and future silicon valley clients
2286135 listen this fight thing has been ok but heres how we take it to the next level during your fight with rashad evans im going to have one of the ring girls distract the official it should be easy because he is so unprofessional that the mere sight of a female in skimpy clothing will command 100 percent of his attention at that point im going to enter the octagon and hit evans in the face with a steel chair then after the fight im going to come in and raise your hand while people shower us with pop bottles and other garbage
2286136 how important is it for hockey to be played on ice is it important to keep the game on ice instead of on a field and played no sticks and a ball instead of a puck
2286137 but the project would also be environmentally friendly ensuring the color of palo alto would embody greenness even if it emerged as blue or yellow
2286138 if they felt they could have pursued the person easily and not develop into a high speed chase id say why not thats what we pay you guys to do
2286139 are we going to chase somebody thats driving evasively someone we cannot control we dont know what hes going to do we cant control his actions or any of that over a property crime
2286140 whats important is the acropolis steakhouse is an all nude bar they serve steak and naked women at the same time

2286154 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
2286155 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
2286156 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up

2286161 agri processors categorically denies the suggestion that it knowingly hired or retained minors as employees and it protests the issuance of a press release that has patently been motivated by a desire to ride the crest of the wave of current public opinion adverse to agri processors
2286162 notwithstanding the leisurely pace of its investigation the inability of even the governments expert to identify any employees in the plant as minors and the refusal to disclose the identities of any employees who the labor commissioner believed to be employed in violation of child labor laws the commissioner has now issued an inflammatory press release alleging that there were 57 cases and egregious violations
2286163 quite frankly it really loosened things up people were more willing to talk after the raid than they were before the raid
2286164 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2286165 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2286166 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2286167 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2286168 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2286169 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2286170 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on the ground

2286173 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting those pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefits and pay in recent years companies from intel corporation to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation
2286174 were dealing with a county that can really finance its own reconstruction
2286175 we havent had an upgrade to the american voting system since 1845

2286207 we never try to convert those who receive aid from missionaries of charity to christianity but in our work we bear witness to the love of gods presence and if catholics protestants buddhists or agnostics become for this better men simply better we will be satisfied it matters to the individual what church he belongs to if that individual thinks and believes that this is the only way to god for her or him this is the way god comes into their life his life if he does not know any other way and if he has no doubt so that he does not need to search then this is his way to salvation

2286316 for the peace corps the number of volunteers has always trumped the quality of their work perhaps because the agency fears that an objective assessment of its impact would reveal that while volunteers generate good will for the united states they do little or nothing to actually aid development in poor countries the agency has no comprehensive system for self evaluation but rather relies heavily on personal anecdote to demonstrate its worth

2286339 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive unrealistic
2286340 there is some impression and talk in the town and country that your administration seems to have lost its momentum and to be slowing down and to be moving on the defensive could you comment on this feeling in the country
2286341 i think we are making some progress so that if you ask me whether this was the winter of our discontent i would say no if you would ask me whether we were doing quite as well this winter as we were doing in the fall i would say no too
2286342 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive unrealistic
2286343 there is some impression and talk in the town and country that your administration seems to have lost its momentum and to be slowing down and to be moving on the defensive could you comment on this feeling in the country
2286344 i think we are making some progress so that if you ask me whether this was the winter of our discontent i would say no if you would ask me whether we were doing quite as well this winter as we were doing in the fall i would say no too
2286345 i am not going to keep the people who elected my husband away from him
2286346 the president is seriously ticked at you there is no rift between him and lyndon suggesting anything different just isnt true
2286347 well jack talked to lyndon and the vice president assured him he didnt mind staying in washington for clint hills funeral
2286348 the president will make everything clear at his press conference tonight
2286349 ive never looked forward to taking your questions so much before
2286350 before i do though id like to say a few words about what happened last friday in dallas i dont like to believe i was the target of an assassination not long before the shots were fired mrs connally said to me mr president you cant say dallas doesnt love you that is very obvious i told her
2286351 i want to go on believing that the accused assassin is in the hands of the law i am confident the truth will come out during the investigation and at his trial
2286352 political murder of any kind has no place in a civil democratic society political murder of an able caring public servant like john connally is particularly heinous he was young and bright and handsome and personable he had come a long way and he might have gone further still now hell never have the chance
2286353 as for special agent hill the bible says it better than i could greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends clint hill did just that and made himself a friend of the american people forever in the doing and officer tippit was gunned down in the line of duty investigating the governors murder chief curry has called him a very fine dedicated officer and he proved the truth of that on friday my heart goes out to his family and to agent hills and to john connallys we will see justice done on their killer
2286354 mr president do you believe lee harvey oswald was shooting at you rather than at governor connally
2286355 clearly though we cant dismiss the possibility sooner or later the truth will come out
2286356 i havent the faintest idea especially when im such a fine charming fellow
2286357 i dont mean to brag now i read it in the newspapers
2286358 mr president what do you think theyll do with oswald
2286359 if the evidence is strong enough theyll indict him hell go to trial if hes convicted hell suffer the appropriate penalties under the law
2286360 id have to consult with the justice department before i gave you a firm answer
2286361 the courts might also have to speak to that issue its an interesting question tim
2286362 is there any truth to reports of a conflict between you and the vice president sir
2286363 the only conflict is one of scheduling the way things worked out governor connallys funeral and agent hills are on the same day almost at the same time i was in the car with the governor and he was the most prominent person killed its only right that the highest ranking government official should attend his funeral and so i will its that simple
2286364 if thats true then why did the ledger run that story about how unhappy the vice president was
2286365 well i cant expect you to say anything else but believe me thats not the way it looks from here
2286366 and you wrote this while he was talking but even if he wants to argue about a word or two its plenty clear what his feelings are
2286367 if kennedy flying to austin means putting the screws to lyndon johnson that wont break the presidents heart they dont love each other way i hear it
2286368 johnson and bobby kennedy hate each others guts and they both have their eyes on 1968
2286369 i tell you something i dont know which one im more afraid of
2286370 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive unrealistic
2286371 there is some impression and talk in the town and country that your administration seems to have lost its momentum and to be slowing down and to be moving on the defensive could you comment on this feeling in the country
2286372 i think we are making some progress so that if you ask me whether this was the winter of our discontent i would say no if you would ask me whether we were doing quite as well this winter as we were doing in the fall i would say no too
2286373 why gentlemen do you know its not even a federal crime to assassinate the president of the united states or any other official of the government that is i say that is a shame and a disgrace
2286374 i am going to call for changes in legislation that will let the government of the united states protect and defend its own
2286375 and i am going to call for an inquiry into how this particular assassin mr oswald if he is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury of his peers succeeded in killing not only the governor of texas but a secret service agent and how he might also have attempted to murder president kennedy
2286376 wont the texas authorities be conducting the same kind of investigation senator
2286377 i say i expect they will but we can cast a broader net and one with finer meshes they may be good at finding out about what happened in dallas last friday but for what led up to it for what led oswald to do the deed if indeed he did a federal investigation seems more appropriate to me
2286378 i have no doubt we will if it can be shown that oswald acted at the behest of some foreign power and especially if it can be shown that he did try to assassinate the president that would be very serious indeed
2286379 well you know how the white house is any president naturally wishes congress would roll over on its belly and wave its legs in the air the executive branch believes that to be our proper role this administration seems no different so no they havent been very encouraging
2286380 that may be why they may think it touches them too closely or they may have some other reason altogether one they dont care to discuss with a mere senator
2286381 congress has got to keep its nose out of our business
2286382 they would dig up too many things wed rather not have them see
2286383 how do we stop them without making them wonder why were stopping them
2286384 whatever we have to do we go and do and take the fallout later
2286385 do you know the best way to kill a cat you drown it in cream
2286386 if they want an investigation by god well give them an investigation
2286387 the whole point of this is that we cant let those yahoos start poking their noses into things
2286388 when i heard what ev was up to i got on the phone myself
2286389 only ours will look at the true facts we need to make certain that if certain situations occur that could undermine national security well i took an oath to protect this country am i right here
2286390 thats the kind of investigation we need and thats the kind were going to get serious sensitive to our security concerns
2286391 and i found the perfect man to head it up
2286392 earl warren i asked him and he said yes he said he would be honored as a matter of fact
2286393 can we trust him not to go wandering off on his own
2286394 he is still the chief justice he made it plain to me that would be his first concern even if he took on this commission too i told him that was too bad but i understood and i was willing to go along with it
2286395 and with warren heading it were fireproof hes not just the chief justice of the supreme court hes a republican so nobody can say were being partisan
2286396 but dont forget he ran with dewey against truman in 48
2286397 but hes come left since then its the birchers who stick up impeach earl warren billboards now
2286398 its almost as good as having the communists go after you
2286399 and we can give this commission some bright young men from the justice department to help the distinguished members find what theyre looking for as long as we want them to look for it
2286400 and to help them not find it if we dont
2286401 does that include the statement that he intended to shoot the president
2286402 the only statement lee harvey oswald has made or will make for the record is that he is innocent in every particular and expects to be vindicated
2286403 look where we are ladies and gentlemen this is the buckle of the bible belt
2286404 its also one of the most conservative cities in america general billy walker lives here for instance and he was too conservative for the army for crying out loud
2286405 yeah and didnt oswalds wife say he took a shot at him too last spring
2286406 like her husband she reserves all her constitutional rights and i remind all of you that this is the first time she has been represented by proper legal counsel rendering any statements inadmissible in any case a wife cant be compelled to testify against her husband
2286407 if you want my opinion gentlemen i think you have to consider the possibility of a grand right wing conspiracy
2286408 the president is progressive and governor connally was well progressive for a texan plenty of people with a vested interest in nipping change in the bud oh my yes
2286409 conspiracy nothing district attorney wade says a bullet they got from connally matches oswalds gun what have you got to say about that
2286410 henry wade can say whatever he damn well pleases hes a state lackey and they pay him to get convictions he doesnt care that hes prejudicing the jury pool against my client
2286411 im not afraid to say truth to power and stand by it

2286413 there is some impression and talk in the town and country that your administration seems to have lost its momentum and to be slowing down and to be moving on the defensive could you comment on this feeling in the country
2286414 i think we are making some progress so that if you ask me whether this was the winter of our discontent i would say no if you would ask me whether we were doing quite as well this winter as we were doing in the fall i would say no too

2286416 skepticism is a tool that should always be used when questioning most things but when you are selling a ground breaking idea and youre doing it on a legal basis with the best of intentions skepticism can become a real problem
2286417 and now it is my great honor and distinct privilege to introduce the vice president of the united states mr lyndon baines johnson
2286418 all i have i would have given gladly not to be standing here today
2286419 a good man is dead three good men are dead because a miserable rotten coward picked up a rifle and pulled the trigger
2286420 clint hill knew there were dangers when he joined the secret service hed known there were dangers when he went into the army too and he came through those the way a man should no one made him jump up on the trunk of the car that carried the president and governor connally and their wives nobody would have thought less of him if he didnt do it because something like jumping up onto a moving automobile that is under fire is plainly above and beyond the call of duty but he did and because he did it he took a bullet meant for
2286421 now hes gone and if god ever needs a bodyguard up there in heaven he knows just where to look because clint hill proved he could do the job right he didnt think of his family first he thought of what hed signed up to do and he went and did it i hope thats some consolation to those he leaves behind chances are it isnt not yet but one day maybe youll be proud because clint hill made the whole country his family in dallas friday afternoon god bless him god bless you and god bless the united states
2286422 you did real well for me and for clint and i know youd rather be somewhere else right now
2286423 maam its nothing personal not as far as you and your husband are concerned
2286424 thank you for coming back to our state mr president
2286425 but this is the last chance ill ever have to pay my respects to governor connally and nothing could keep me away
2286426 but if theres some nut with a gun along the route we hope hell think it is and we didnt publicize which route wed use either so if there is a nut he may be waiting in the wrong place
2286427 i wouldnt tell any of you this shit if you could get it out fast enough to make a difference
2286428 do you think wed endanger the presidents life for a scoop
2286429 thats the only kind of tie old prestos got its his trademark like connally would drop dead all over again if he wore an ordinary one
2286430 well if you see him in one of those things you dont forget him
2286431 you may go whos the damn fool in the polka dots but you dont forget him a politician could do worse
2286432 i wanted to be governor one day but not like this john connally wasnt done using the job he was good at it too i learned from him every single day i wanted to go on doing that till john decided to turn his hand to something else then id take what i had learned and try my best with it well one of the things i learned in a hurry is that john connally would be a tough act to follow now i have to try and i feel horribly unprepared i wanted john around for many many years to come he should have been its a crying shame that he isnt and ill just have to carry on instead with gods help maybe i can do some of what he would have
2286433 he had much to live for much yet to do he would have gone far had he lived no one can doubt that hed already come a long way serving his state and his country with courage and with wisdom
2286434 why would anyone want to take the life of such a man
2286435 an assassin tries to lift himself to the level of the man he slays a little man thinks he can make himself big with the squeeze of a trigger
2286436 the harshest punishment we can give an assassin then is to forget him once governor connallys killer is tried and convicted and punished let us never speak his name again never the greek historian herodotus tells of a man who burned a great temple to win everlasting fame i know his name herodotus says but i will not set it down here and that man who wanted to be remembered forever has been forgotten for twenty five hundred years let us do the same today
2286437 let us forget the wretched assassin and recall the man he stole from us
2286438 as an attorney as a naval officer as a public servant as a husband and father john connally showed everything that was best about the united states of america let us remember him for what he was and for what he might have been let us mourn his loss to texas to the united states and to his wife and children and let us vow to do everything in our power to make sure such a tragedy does not cannot happen again may that too form part of governor connallys legacy
2286439 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive unrealistic
2286440 there is some impression and talk in the town and country that your administration seems to have lost its momentum and to be slowing down and to be moving on the defensive could you comment on this feeling in the country

2286442 latest gallup poll says kennedys approval rating is eighty seven percent
2286443 i dont think jesus had an eighty seven percent approval rating
2286444 nobodys tried to blow his head off lately and kennedys like a pig in clover right now what did churchill say
2286445 nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result
2286446 stylish horseshit is still horseshit its worse horseshit cause youre more likely to believe it what time have you got
2286447 somethings going on at the white house at eleven they just got the word out yesterday so they cooked it up in a hurry whatever it is
2286448 then ill make an introduction and after that there will be time for questions
2286449 this morning i signed executive order number 11130 creating a commission to investigate the assassination of governor john b
2286450 the subject of the commissions inquiry is a chain of events that saddened and shocked the people of the united states and indeed the world by my order establishing this commission i hope to avoid parallel investigations and to concentrate fact finding in a body having the broadest national mandate as chairman of the commission i have chosen earl warren chief justice of the supreme court and former attorney general and governor of california
2286451 we will conduct a thorough and independent investigation of these tragic events
2286452 we will cooperate with the dallas police department in any way we can obviously they have a criminal investigation and trial to conduct we do not want to interfere with mr oswalds right to a fair trial if he is found guilty we do hope to determine whether his sole purpose was the assassination of governor connally or whether as is now widely believed he intended to kill president kennedy too we will also examine all rumors or assertions relating to a possible conspiracy
2286453 the makeup of the warren commission is not yet complete
2286454 two other distinguished gentlemen who have agreed to serve are allen dulles former director of central intelligence and john j mccloy former u s high commissioner for germany and assistant secretary of war both are attorneys and have served administrations of both parties
2286455 can you have this commission do its job and still give oswald a fair trial
2286456 we hope so we believe so otherwise we wouldnt have formed it
2286457 how will this affect the congressional investigation senator dirksen has been talking about
2286458 it will do many of the same things i dont know that both ought to go forward but im not trying to tell senator dirksen what to do
2286459 it would take a bolder man than me to try any such thing
2286460 when do you expect this commission to finish its report
2286461 part of that will depend on the progress of mr oswalds trial and on whether any further arrests are made
2286462 in the absence of those i would expect it to take something on the order of a year
2286463 that means it would come out around the time of the next election
2286464 we will not delay it past the election if it is in any way unfavorable to the administration
2286465 nor will we move it forward if it shows the administration in a particularly good light we aim to keep it as far removed from national politics as we possibly can
2286466 this is one advantage an independent commission has over a congressional investigation
2286467 by the very nature of things a congressional investigation is bound to be partisan
2286468 lets see how ev finds a silver lining in this
2286469 i find myself today in the unpleasant position of the atheist in his coffin all dressed up with no place to go
2286470 many of you know i planned to announce a congressional investigation into the recent tragic events in dallas
2286471 the president has forestalled me there is no doubt he has chosen a very able and distinguished figure to head his commission while the one formed by congress would have been stuck with me
2286472 two of my illustrious colleagues senator john sherman cooper of kentucky and representative hale boggs of arkansas whom i had approached with an eye toward their serving as part of the congressional investigatory
2286473 did you also try to volunteer for the warren commission senator
2286474 they are trying to limit its size however in the hope that that will correspondingly increase its efficiency i believe its full membership is now set
2286475 the president impressed on me the importance of avoiding duplicative efforts
2286476 if however i see the warren commission faltering for any reason i reserve the right to revive our own inquiry
2286477 i dont anticipate this mind you even if it is my duty to mention the possibility
2286478 how disappointed are you that the president formed the warren commission
2286479 if it does its job as it should i have no reason to be disappointed
2286480 if for any reason it fails to be thorough and impartial that will be another matter but again i expect nothing of the sort
2286481 i think he needs to be tried and convicted if he is convicted before we speak of such things
2286482 much as i hate to mention it assertions made in the press are not always completely accurate i know none of you here would ever commit such a heinous sin as inexactitude but i cannot vouch for all your comrades
2286483 he was shocked to hear that connally was the victim
2286484 well then i suggest you take your observation directly to this new warren commission
2286485 surely they will want to take that information into consideration tell them i said you should call

2286487 there is some impression and talk in the town and country that your administration seems to have lost its momentum and to be slowing down and to be moving on the defensive could you comment on this feeling in the country
2286488 i think we are making some progress so that if you ask me whether this was the winter of our discontent i would say no if you would ask me whether we were doing quite as well this winter as we were doing in the fall i would say no too
2286489 its because there is a disillusionment with kennedy the election results in the major cities are a storm signal so there is the possibility that kennedy could be beaten and this is an increasing possibility as this possibility increases so does the interest in getting a republican who can win i find there is a correlation between kennedys failures and interest in me as he goes down the stock of any potential republican candidate goes up
2286490 if this viet war goes sour viet nam could be a hot issue next year if it goes well it wont be its strange to me when we are fawning over tito catering to kadar accommodating khrushchev we dont have the decency to express our sympathy to a family which was a real foe of communism

2286494 we are keeping all lines of communication open between the various law enforcement jurisdictions
2286495 at the same time the justice department working with mr hoovers fbi has begun its own internal investigation
2286496 what did you and the president discuss when you first talked
2286497 and his was that the american people should pray for governor connally and special agent hill and later of course officer tippit
2286498 we thank god and his son jesus christ and the glorious virgin that john and jacqueline kennedy are preserved alive today and came unharmed through the danger they faced friday in dallas
2286499 we rejoice for their sake and for the sake of the country the president leads while rejoicing we do not forget the tragic loss of governor connally of brave special agent hill and of officer j d tippit gunned down while attempting to question the assassin our hearts are heavy because of what they have suffered yet also glad because while the president and first lady walked through the valley of the shadow of death the lord saw fit to spare them for further service
2286500 that i was glad to be there to listen to all the nice things he was saying about me
2286501 bad enough if he wasnt worse if he was except for poor governor connally of course
2286502 and for agent hill as well my heart goes out to him and his loved ones well just have to find out thats all
2286503 move back boys move back no more questions no more photos

2286506 i am sadder than i know how to tell you
2286507 he was a friend ive known him since he was a very young man and liked him and admired him too he worked for me for a spell youll know that and he made a wonderful just a wonderful governor of texas i looked to see him on the national stage one day before too long i wouldnt have been surprised to see him run for president and i wouldnt have been surprised to see him win
2286508 his funeral is set for day after tomorrow i expect youll be there
2286509 ive know john connally since 1939 and hes going down to austin were you even born in 1939 mr leibowitz

2286512 ill be there ive got nothing against clint hill he was a good man a brave man but john connally was my
2286513 i sure as hell wish things couldve worked out different though
2286514 even if they scheduled the funerals at different times so they could both attend number one and number two wont be in the same place at the same time
2286515 you go 82 hours without sleep and see how funny you are
2286516 our problem is lbj wanted to talk there his witnesses are his wife and a few secret service agents on our side we got our man in city halls word on it
2286517 i dont care write it up the way it was leave out the bad language but get the point across blend your work together into a single piece of sunday services
2286518 he knew you were a reporter right he knew you were taking notes right he didnt say it was off the record right
2286519 white house will hate it and andy will love it
2286520 now sit down and type up your exact notes i want em on my desk before you leave today

2286537 lots of people theyre saying they believe you planned to shoot the president not the governor now mr oswald im asking you straight whats the truth in that
2286538 we have the statements of the police officers escorting that that was their interpretation
2286539 i was out of my head i thought people were going to kill me everybody was acting crazy
2286540 maybe it would be smart for you to come clean mr oswald maybe you dont understand how much trouble youre in
2286541 weve got witnesses who saw you shoot a police officer weve got strong evidence that you shot the governor and the secret service man too those are all capital crimes if youre convicted youll go to the electric chair
2286542 i didnt do any of that stuff so what can i say about it
2286543 why would you want to kill the president of the united states
2286544 i dont feel anything about the president one way or the other
2286545 i cant do anything right im nothing but a fuckup
2286546 why do you say that do you say it because you hit the governor and not the president
2286547 would i be in jail if it wasnt i should have stayed in russia
2286548 but youre making that kind of investigation yourself arent you
2286549 yes but we know which questions to ask and which ones not to
2286550 if one brother said it was okay i assumed he did it on the authority of the other
2286551 its got to disappear vanish go away it never existed you understand me
2286552 get rid of it then and i want all the tapes for safekeeping
2286553 when the presidents brother whos also the chief law enforcement official in the country tells you to hop you ask how high on the way up i figured anything bobby kennedy said came straight from jack and thats what the secret service is for taking care of the president and doing things that need doing for him
2286554 kennedy looked at me with the coldest expression in the world he said thats my worry mr bouck you can bet i didnt ask any more questions
2286555 the president is studying the situation in dallas when things there become clearer he will hold a press conference one day next week probably until then he doesnt see how he can have any comment except to repeat that he is shocked and saddened by the loss of governor connally and agent hill and also by the loss of officer tippit and if youll permit me so am i
2286556 its not easy for anyone to be around gunfire and bloodshed and unlike her husband she never saw combat this was the first time anything like that ever happened near her her thoughts and prayers are with the victims families
2286557 do you think this attack will increase support for gun control legislation
2286558 do i personally think so i wouldnt bet anything i care about losing
2286559 the president and the attorney general will probably sit down at some point and see if they think they can do anything within the limits of the constitution they respect the second amendment of course

2286563 come on chuck everybody needs another set of eyes on the big ones
2286564 facts are all in here does the job storys exciting enough to carry it
2286565 you think it buries the lead you think it needs more punch
2286566 even though its got to be the lead nobody really cares if he was the first governor murdered in office theres fifty of them theres one president and he was in the car
2286567 but the man a foot away from him is dead
2286568 your last sentence needs to come second the facts from the library are background not foreground where youve got them
2286569 they dont know that its got anything to do with the connally shooting but
2286570 i want the son of a bitch who tried to kill me
2286571 it was odd he acted so sure but he was standing there and the governor and that poor agent were dead or almost
2286572 people lose all sense in there they say things they dont mean ive heard it i dont know how many times
2286573 i want to know if sam giancana is behind it i need to know right now can you say yes or no
2286574 i honestly dont know but we have to consider all the possibilities
2286575 theyve arrested him for shooting connally and a secret service agent and a cop
2286576 theyre checking the president out but he wasnt hit at least thats the word now
2286577 lee harvey oswald ex marine lived in russia from 1959 to 1962 claimed to be a marxist tried to renounce citizenship but didnt came back in june of 62 with a russian wife marina
2286578 lived in new orleans earlier this year theres a photo of him passing out leaflets for something called the fair play for cuba committee thats it
2286579 connallys a democrat hes one of lbjs fair haired boys
2286580 sounds like the guys got a screw loose or maybe two or three fair play for castro
2286581 andy this paper cannot afford to not be in dallas now you can send duncan but he covers the president and the president is going to come back to washington and me im a city reporter i know how city bureaucracy works dallas is just another city i can be on the next flight out
2286582 cannot be dismissed as a successful assassination attempt on governor connally it may be a potential assassination attempt on the president of the united states
2286583 we need to separate the president from the vice president to assure continuity of authority in case of attack
2286584 you cant fly together one of you has to leave now
2286585 lyndon stay in texas i have to get back people will need to see that
2286586 this crime may or may not have national implications but it took place in dallas we know how to prosecute murder down here and i expect we can handle this case wherever the facts take us
2286587 the government is secure our prayers are with the connally hill and tippit families justice will be done on all guilty parties
2286588 mr president you said guilty parties does that mean you think someone besides this oswald was involved
2286589 no i simply meant that if this gunman this lone gunman apparently is guilty then a jury will make that decision pierre will talk to you at the white house soon

2286596 some persons spent dozens of hours going over details large and small many supplied us with contemporaneous notes and diaries all interviews were conducted on background meaning we could use the information if the identity of the source could be protected we did not accord equal weight to all sources in the course of nearly two and a half years of reporting on the fall of the kennedy administration we knew who could be trusted and who couldnt

2286600 this company is so incredibly cheap you shouldnt be here
2286601 no sweat but if he takes jackie back to paris im on that plane for sure
2286602 im not done its the garbage kickback piece but like i say im not done
2286603 everybody needs a new set of eyes on a big one
2286604 we have the president he is okay repeat he is okay
2286605 im alive and im the president of the united states that is an order
2286606 listen andy i can back chuck up on this one
2286607 you think you get the story because you ripped the wire copy
2286608 look i dont know where this storys gonna go but for now drop the garbage kickbacks and watch his back
2286609 my girlfriend has a friend in the white house i think she said there was a lot of talk about not going to texas in the first place guess they had reason to be worried huh
2286610 but you ask the bosses questions and she hears stuff while shes working shes a solid source
2286611 while were thinking about that we need to make a run on the morgue
2286612 for starters when was the last time we had a governor shot
2286613 what if the guy was aiming for jfk instead of uh
2286614 right right but whens the last time a president got shot
2286615 no 1901 thats what made teddy roosevelt president but kennedys alive so it doesnt matter
2286616 we have three teams sir the governor is in the care of doctor carrico and agent hill has already gone straight to the or you may have been shot i need you to lie down and let me examine you
2286617 well doctor i can assure you i would like very much to lie down on that gurney but i cant right now
2286618 tore a muscle shoveling dirt in canada this month i can barely move
2286619 both of these were right around the turn of the century
2286620 one was william goebel who was elected governor of kentucky in 1900 or the democrats said he was the election was disputed to put it mildly he got shot they administered the oath and then he died the other one was frank steunenberg the governor of idaho some labor union radicals blew him up with a bomb in 1905 but that was after he was out of office
2286621 so if connally dies hes the first no doubt about it governor to get murdered while hes governor right
2286622 when they know for sure president kennedy is okay call me okay
2286623 but pull everything you can find on attempts on the president too

2286628 in the ancient olympic games the element of cultural and mental activity was present
2286629 in the olympic games until the second world war there were competitions that rewarded the mental efforts of people in the same manner they rewarded physical efforts
2286630 today the missing element of the intellectual competition can be reintroduced by the involvement of chess and perhaps bridge

2286653 statistics show that young people arent getting enough exercise and nows the time to make that happen
2286654 we have treadmills but we also have the avenue to help students make some important decisions with their health
2286655 the grants theme is the development of curricula in three interdisciplinary fields neuroscience chemical biology and computational biology
2286656 the summer undergraduate research program will mimic the colleges surf program in that it provides student stipends and research supply money for student faculty pairs

2286659 it is an unsatisfactory replacement for face to face interaction
2286660 the object is not just to talk at your class
2286661 any way that you can get feedback during class will maximize learning
2286662 professors cant respond to needs of their audience you dont know whether your students are understanding the material or engaged in the material
2286663 we saw this as a way of helping a lot of students
2286664 to some extent theres no replacement for being in class
2286665 it really helps for incidental absences but our primary concern was to give students another tool to keep up with classwork
2286666 theres a whole host of students who can benefit if they can revisit aspects of class that confused them
2286667 having someone show you their city and open their home to you truly adds to the experience i have been fortunate enough to travel and experience a place through the eyes of someone who knows it best building an international community and meeting new people through couch surfing has helped me to learn and appreciate other cultures

2286678 heres a guy who was very quick on the political trigger by joining bloombergs coalition of gun grabbing municipal chief executives
2286679 but he really misfired when he violated his bond agreement and crossed the border into canada last month without telling the court in advance the behavior that got him into this legal quagmire suggests that kilpatrick considers himself above the law
2286680 new yorks mayor is lucky hes not facing charges for that vigilante gun shop sting operation he mounted two years ago because it interfered with legitimate federal investigations did kilpatrick think that he would also avoid trouble even though he lied under oath about a relationship he had with his former chief of staff
2286681 is hardly the face id want representing any group of mayors if i were michael bloomberg
2286682 mayors against illegal guns has been campaigning against a constitutionally protected fundamental civil right under the guise of crime control

2286687 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
2286688 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
2286689 if airports think guns should not be allowed they should have the right to modify their security plan to reflect that
2286690 there is no justification for permitting firearms at any airport
2286691 you might like to have a gun in your car because you come home on an 11 30 p m flight
2286692 as the official outfitter of the u s olympic and paralympic teams ralph lauren will have a greater presence at the games than any other designer members of the u s teams will wear apparel from his collection during the opening and closing ceremonies the opening ceremony outfits are reminiscent of the classics reflected in the 1920s and 30s while the closing ceremony outfits have a much sportier feel and edge

2286710 if an assailant is bent on picking out a victim and the victim happens to be permitted to carry a concealed weapon and introduces it early enough it prevents a crime without a bullet being fired

2286722 each time a man stands for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring these ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance for the fortunate among us there is the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who enjoy the privilege of education but that is not the road that history has marked out for us like it or not we live in times of danger and uncertainty but they are more open to the creative energy of men than any other time in history the future does not belong to those who are content with today apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike timid and fearful in the face of new ideas and bold projects rather it will belong to those who can blend vision reason and courage in a personal commitment to the ideas and great enterprises of american society

2286743 come together he had once asked them in a song and now they came tens of thousands of them to share their grief and shock at the news john lennon once the cheeky wit and sardonic soul of the beatles whose music had touched a generation and enchanted the world had been slain on his doorstep by a confused suicidal young man who had apparently idolized him along new yorks central park west and west 72nd street in front of the building where lennon had lived and died they stood for hours in tearful vigil looking to each other and his music for comfort
2286744 the killing stunned the nation and much of the world as nothing had since the political assassinations of the 1960s
2286745 lennon semiconscious and bleeding profusely was placed in the back seat of officer james morans patrol car do you know who you are moran asked him lennon couldnt speak he moaned and nodded his head as if to say yes moran said though doctors pronounced lennon dead on arrival at roosevelt hospital a team of seven surgeons labored desperately to revive him but his wounds were too severe there were three holes in his chest two in his back and two in his left shoulder it wasnt possible to resuscitate him by any means said dr stephen lynn the hospitals director of emergency services hed lost 3 to 4 quarts of blood from the gun wounds about 80 percent of his blood volume
2286746 these are great songs if they are pop then clearly pop is capable of greatness in expressing the pathos of mass society
2286747 some people are saying this is the end of an era but what we said before still stands the 80s will be a beautiful decade john loved and prayed for the human race please tell people to pray the same for him please remember that he had deep faith and love for life and that though he has now joined the greater force he is still with us
2286748 its like theres only so much room in the national cultural hard drive so as you continue to add more stuff you dont remember everything about everything anymore
2286749 john lennon as a solo artist has been reduced to imagine and as a cultural icon hes been somewhat reduced to the give peace a chance guy
2286750 a nation of pained hearts americans black and white may be able to use the o j verdict as a chance to embark on a pilgrimage toward and candor and charity
2286751 at least there was one moment of visible black and white unity last week it occurred on tuesday shortly after 10 a m pacific time when crowds of citizens gathered together in the streets like extras in a war of the worlds movie of the 1950s stood staring up at outdoor television screens waiting for the word they were united briefly in an anxious silence of the heart as soon as the verdict was read however they split apart they could watch themselves do it on the split screens on one side jubilation on the other dismay afterward it was said that america should have seen it coming that the division of the races cut so deep it ought to have been obvious that two nations had always been hiding in one

2286765 when avoidable financial hardships force hospitals to shut their doors new jerseyans in need are forced to travel longer distances to receive immediate medical care
2286766 we cannot allow fiscal issues to cause another hospital to close its doors and further jeopardize the quality and availability of health care in new jersey
2286767 hospital trustees must be trained in their role and responsibilities to ensure that a hospitalis operating efficiently and managing its finances responsibly
2286768 appropriate education and training are key to ensuring that hospital boards are staffed with the most capable and knowledgeable individuals to prevent mismanagement of precious hospital resources
2286769 it is imperative that new jersey communities are part of the decision making process regarding the delivery of health care services to ensure that hospitals are providing quality care to the communities that rely on its services the most
2286770 decisions regarding how health care is delivered should not be made in a vacuum the local community deserves to have a voice in the process
2286771 hospital officials need to ensure an open public dialogue regarding programs and services that can ensure the communitys health care needs are being met
2286772 closer scrutiny of how health care dollars are spent at hospitals in dire financial straits can help turn around poor management and prevent a hospital from shutting its doors for good
2286773 audits and monitoring by state officials will bring accountability and transparency to new jerseys healthcare industry
2286774 the state has a responsibility to step in and hold hospitals accountable for how health care dollars are spent and managed
2286775 giving state officials the power to intervene at the first sign of financial distress can help prevent the closing of yet another new jersey health care facility
2286776 we must do everything to ensure that hospitals already operating in the red are being doubly responsible with their finances

2286780 the glitch was we had to come up with a new parent company name so in brilliant and strategic fashion we came up with yellow roadway corporation and brought the two names together
2286781 we tripled in size in 30 months and we started to look for more international growth
2286782 the name yellow didnt translate in a lot of markets very effectively
2286783 interestingly enough once we introduced yellow roadway corporation people started to abbreviate it as yrc and that acronym was more easily translated into other languages
2286784 if the roadway name went away along with the yellow name we had some latitude to make the change without offending anyone

2286798 forget about everything you have become accustomed to during the last 20 years because things are going to be very different going forward

2286800 even if the housing market comes back from the deep depression it has been in for the last 2 plus years and it will come back the economic environment will remain very weak

2286820 ideally they would like it that the only thing the new entrants can pick up is people who already dont have cellphones which is a lot tougher sell
2286821 its going to be tougher for the new entrants especially if they see most of the subscribers when they move into the market already locked into three year contracts
2286822 i suspect that what some of the carriers might be trying to do is to get folks to sign up for extended contracts over the next year
2286823 theres going to be lots of choice out there lots of opportunities to get really good deals and find all sorts of devices and i would imagine there are all sorts of services that i havent even begun to think of i think back to school next year there are going to be come exciting offers
2286824 since those phones are normally quite expensive they will heavily subsidize them in order to get people to come in and get longer term contracts
2286825 i would do it if i were them i would try to make sure that my customer base is more secure and offer something in advance of a new entrant such as a globalive being out there its going to take time to build our network so they might as well get a jump on us
2286826 a highly competitive wireless landscape is business as usual for rogers
2286827 we have always operated and thrived in a highly competitive environment providing high value plans and services to an increasing customer base
2286828 offer the ability to have parents turn off text messaging or block specific numbers time and days or phone based purchases
2286829 family oriented services are garnering a huge interest in the wireless industry today as carriers are looking to tap the capacity of this potential gold mine
2286830 theres not an incredible lot of growth left in the teen market 13 to 17 year olds because the overall wireless market in the u s has been slowing down during the past few years
2286831 so there has been a lot of focus on targeting teens through the family plans that carriers offer verizon and at amp t in particular have very strong market share with their family plans its basically a bucket of minutes that can be shared across all of the members of your family for an add on cost of 10 for each line it has been an incredibly successful way to target the teen market so much so that 85 percent of teens are on family plans
2286832 what becomes a bit more of a struggle with the tween market is that obviously the tweens arent going to buy the cell phones themselves the decision making process is virtually 100 percent in their parents hands so its a matter of do parents think their child needs a cell phone
2286833 the other question beyond that is parents have a fear of overage charges and ask if i get my child a cell phone is my cell phone bill going to be 500 a month
2286834 manage the number of phone calls text messages picture messages
2286835 what they want is the knobs and dials that they can turn and adjust as the needs of their families change
2286836 on all phones incoming text messages from specific numbers can be blocked by logging into the customers online my sprint account and entering the numbers to be blocked
2286837 text messaging capability can also be completely disabled on all phones by calling sprint customer care there is no charge for either service
2286838 share photos that could embarrass me or others now or in the future
2286839 technology isnt the total solution kids have so many workarounds they can use their friends phones if parents arent vigilant or dont have rules kids can be texting with their friends all night long with their phone under the pillow
2286840 it can be something like im a little concerned about your grades or that youre not getting enough sleep at night so i think were going to need to have a new rule and that is that the phone goes off and in my hands at 9 p m or something like that
2286841 one day we had them and one day we didnt and then they were gone

2286844 murchison refused at which point chief coleman told her she was under arrest murchison stood up and the chief grabbed her to place her under arrest
2286845 from what youre telling me that would be acting in the capacity of a police officer shes not certified so she shouldnt be acting in the capacity of a police officer
2286846 is there a reason why you cant talk to me about this chief
2286847 she did not just arrest me but she destroyed my life she destroyed my business she hurt my kids
2286848 i could not believe how someone thats not certified could legally take my freedom and my business from me
2286849 chief coleman said lock him up too and i asked why are you locking me up why are you arresting me you already did my wife in why are you arresting me they didnt give me a reason for it

2286863 nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
2286864 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions

2286955 these are the blogs that i read daily and have inspired me to start my own blog if you havent checked any of them out before then give them a try youll end up adding them to your rss feed i almost guarantee it his blog is updated regularly at least once a day during the week often times more the best bit of this blog is the way he presents new ideas often to do with marketing but rather than giving you the full idea hell give you 99 and let you figure out the rest for yourself while this sounds annoying its not by leaving out the 1 he forces you to think it through yourself this not only makes you feel as if the idea is yours you figured out the 1 he didnt it also helps to reinforce the idea in your head if youve never read a marketing blog before this is the place to start i got his book small is the new big and 183 other riffs rants and remarkable business ideas from my aunt and uncle for christmas and since then ive read his whole back catalogue of blog posts and all his this is the first blog i ever read by somebody in the vc industry while fred is in one of the most interesting industries in the world he rarely blogs about it thankfully his taste in music more than makes up for it his play list often reads something like this while our music tastes are extremely similar those are some of my favorite bands at the moment he has a lot of interesting things to say about the vc community vc itself and even products services he has invested in dont worry he is very clear when he has a vested interest in something he also has a knack of posting things which ive been looking for an example of this was a video explanation of what at freds site once youve watched that see if you can subscribe to my rss feed yay my first shameless self promotion i am so proud darren rowse this blog is all about how to make your blog better and how to monetize it with other 19 000 rss subscribers i am thinking this guy knows what he is talking about his subscriber base really helps darren because of it he can post about new technology or old and undoubtedly one of his readers will have used the product service and will be able to provide some statistics for you he also road tests a lot of the products services himself then invites readers to compare results but the site isnt solely concerned about making money its about making your blog better for readers which in the end will increase your ad revenue so i guess it is all about the money ive gotten a lot of my ideas from him and look forward to testing out more of what he has to say if you are thinking about starting a blog yourself you should check it out another blog by a vc he probably posts less about vc than fred but he is my go to guy when i want a book to read he recommended founders at work stories of startups early days
2286956 we have retained counsel and we did file an opposition to a request to certify this bargaining unit

2287003 i am delighted to announce the completion of this exciting merger between sirius and xm
2287004 we have worked diligently to close this transaction and we look forward to integrating our best in class management teams and operations so we can begin delivering on our promise of more choices and lower prices for subscribers
2287005 every one of our constituencies is a winner combined sirius xm radio will deliver superior value to our shareholders by offering more compelling packages and the best content in audio entertainment we are well positioned for increased subscriber growth our laser focus on subscribers will continue and listeners can be assured that there will be no disruption in service we also believe that the completion of the merger will eliminate any confusion that has been lingering in the marketplace
2287006 one of the most exciting benefits of this transaction is the ability to offer subscribers the option of expanding their subscriptions to include the best of both services given the respective popularity of exclusive programming on both sirius and xm we expect many subscribers will upgrade their current subscription
2287007 the upside potential for both consumers and shareholders is huge consumers have the ease of adding premier programming without purchasing a new device for shareholders this kind of organic growth is a key part of the companys future and the success we expect to see
2287008 in addition to realizing significant potential revenue growth the management team will move quickly to capitalize on the synergies that many analysts have predicted for this combination we expect to begin achieving those synergies without sacrificing any of the world class programming and marketing we are known for
2287009 we have all the tools necessary to begin executing as a combined company with high aspirations for subscriber growth and greater financial performance in part from the significant synergies that we begin realizing literally today on day one we are moving quickly to integrate the operations

2287048 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2287049 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2287050 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2287051 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2287052 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2287053 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2287054 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2287055 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2287056 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2287057 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2287058 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2287059 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2287060 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2287061 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2287062 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2287063 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2287064 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2287065 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2287066 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2287067 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2287068 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2287069 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2287070 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2287071 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2287072 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2287073 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2287074 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2287075 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2287076 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2287077 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2287078 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2287079 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2287080 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2287081 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2287082 a word to the wise aint necessary its the stupid ones who need the advice
2287083 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2287084 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2287085 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2287086 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2287087 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2287088 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2287090 gillian darling its cora four out of five women surveyed say that nerds are amazing in bed you simply must go on this cruise wiht me kiss kiss
2287091 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2287092 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2287093 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2287094 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2287095 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2287096 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2287097 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2287098 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2287099 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2287100 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2287101 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2287102 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2287103 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2287104 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2287105 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2287106 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2287107 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2287111 i hadnt even noticed that i had my iphone in my hand as i stretched and yawned and stuck it right in your face
2287112 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2287113 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2287114 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2287115 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2287116 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2287123 is no longer selling the offending product the harm to a patent holder may seem esoteric
2287124 t he negative effects of the plaintiffs emory and microbe guard potential loss in goodwill market share and prestige are real
2287125 on the other hand denying the injunction could expose the plaintiffs to the danger that the defendant might infringe upon the patent again an injunction gives the plaintiffs certainty that the defendant will no longer infringe upon its patents
2287126 a very clear statement of an obligation to respond in a timely fashion under the local rules
2287127 this order specifically relies on novas failure to respond under the local rules as creating admissions that justify summary judgment
2287128 from our perspective the judges approach is interesting he chose to rely on the local rules with a very clear holding that if you fail to comply with the local rules it will result in defaults that can trigger summary judgment
2287129 has not responded to the infringement contentions in 19 months nor even responded to these motions for summary judgment likewise the court finds that the defendants complete disregard for the patent local rules at this late stage will preclude it from introducing any evidence to challenge the patents validity
2287130 big wig did i see the valet driving a c class mercedes for you
2287131 you know we at mega law just added an executive sauna for partners with a swedish masseuse and we have a special relationship with mercedes benz plus we have just hired some oil and gas experts to beef up our practice we can help you provide oil co with more legal services than your current firm could hope to provide of course we would make sure you were getting a larger piece of the pie than those less industrious than you we know how to reward rain makers
2287132 hey now that youre playing hardball i want my fair share from all the years you denied me my full compensation and you never reimbursed me for that 600 bottle of champagne i sprung for at the client dinner after we completed their merger in 02 i am going to tally it all up and sue
2287133 our partner of 20 years big wig has announced his decision to leave those of us who stood by him when he was a wee cog he inherited oil co as a client from one of our original named partners mr big big wig is now seeking to sever not only a long term relationship with our firm but also to take from us a long term institutional client it saddens us but we will seek compensation for this loss we are not completely surprised in recent years big wig has demonstrated an increasing lack of good judgment coupled with some dangerous indulgences his departure is probably for the best we just hope oil co will return home after realizing it was big law and not big wig who was providing the legal services that kept it making record profits in a time of economic crisis we will chug forward with our loyal partners and clients and build a bigger and better tomorrow

2287141 well if i have to find my own doll does that mean i get it for free i should get it for free because youre not very good at this
2287142 no you wont get it for free you have to pay for it but if you continue to give me gip ill charge you double and sell you the clothes separately

2287153 i had a conversation with faye bowdoin this morning andy is in miami at a law firm all day today they have been advised to retain about 4 6 lawyers and firms to contest the allegations made in speaking with faye you can tell that they are just heart broken over this they are sorrowful for all the people that this is hurting right now she said they think the secret service was shocked when they came in and didnt find stacks of money hidden and records with other bank accounts where they have tried to hide money nothing was found they took pictures of their clothes and gathered receipts of things they had recently purchased they followed them to the bathroom and when andy fixed his breakfast she said that they would just appreciate prayers but to know that they have 4 attorney firms that say asd is not a ponzi scheme this is the biggest allegation against andy and asd all of the money was accounted for at bank of america and there is nothing hidden i think that is what will shock the investigators all the money they said came in to asd is at the asd bank accounts they froze the agency would not even let the 85 employees have their paychecks and that was something else that hurt andy and faye they accused them of buying 50k worth of jewelry not true faye said an agent followed them around in miami when she was going through jewelry stores but she doesnt remember buying anything and if she did it might have been a pair of earrings for a buck or so i could hear the tone in her voice as being a hurt person and compassion for all the people that this is hurting she asked that we just stay in prayer over this and depend on the lord to bring them and asd through is the gov protecting the people from asd or should we work at the people protecting ourselves against the government everyone needs to write your congressman and let them know you do not appreciate your tax dollars being spent on shutting down a free enterprise company that was helping a lot of people we dont need to stand for this mess if they get thousands of letters that will make someone listen here is a link to find your congressman https forms house gov wyr welcome shtml please dont call and ask me to go over the conversation again this is all the updated information i have i have catch up work to do for my own company and dont have time to spend with everyone i think it would be appropriate for everyone to write andy amp faye a note of encouragement andy amp faye bowdoin 8 gilcrease lane quincy fl 32351 in his grip thanks john james ps here is another link that may be helpful notice at the top of the website a link to email claims to help fight the gov against closing asd http www thejoyluckclub com asd latest news htm
2287154 the sides of the conflict have been playing a kind of cat and mouse game for a couple of years now and theyve always kind of pushed each other to the brink but then pulled back
2287155 unfortunately thats not what happened in the past 24 hours and what weve seen is a large scale military offensive throughout south ossetia
2287156 a unhcr staff member in that area has reported that many buildings and houses have been destroyed and that only military personnel are moving in the streets

2287158 russia has about 100 000 troops in the region just because its so heavily militarized from chechnya and the other insurgencies that are going on next door
2287159 if this is a long war georgia will be in a considerable amount of trouble just because its forces are so much smaller it only has about 27 000 soldiers and it would rely also on these militia groups that it is starting to reactivate as well but in a long war georgia would be in trouble

2287176 he has decided to stop playing rugby league and start playing the 15 a side game to realise a new dream of playing for the all blacks and learning about rugby union with tana umaga
2287177 he does not want to and is no longer capable of playing in the 13 a side game he is under contract for another three years with the canterbury bulldogs without a performance clause meaning the club have to pay him regardless of his level of play
2287178 but he has decided not to take money from a club for which he does not want to play for and to give the best of himself
2287179 the bulldogs problem is not that a player has a contract with another club but that they have a contract with a player who is not capable of honouring it psychologically a rugby player is not merchandise
2287180 i would only recognise a french court and i only take my orders from the international rugby board and the french rugby federation
2287181 if there is no request for an exit letter there is no recognition of a former contract
2287182 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2287183 the bulldogs will continue to stand up for whats right for the club and continue to stand up for the principle and sanctity of the contract
2287184 im no coward you know i stood up for myself and i stood up for player rights
2287185 thats not a coward act thats showing some balls to really stand up and show that we dont have to cop that we can get what we deserve
2287186 this merger has lasted so long that there has been real buyer fatigue
2287187 the challenge for companies is how to continue to invest in that while cutting costs in the near term

2287193 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2287194 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2287195 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks

2287212 therefore while the settlement offer is well above the citys original appraisal the figure is not outside the potential exposure of the city when considering the value set by the court appointed commissioners and the citys exposure for costs and attorneys fees if a jury awards a value of at least 880 000 the property owners had filed to have their property platted and they allege their potential profit was between 3 4 million if this property completely developed

2287261 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength

2287267 the injunction is relatively simple he has a contract with the bulldogs he is one year into a five year deal
2287268 the expectation was always that hed honour that commitment and this ensures that he cant play for anything other than whats in his contract
2287269 it is however a victory for the sanctity of a contract
2287270 its a victory for the commitment that one person makes to another its as simple as that
2287271 orders of court arent like referees telling players to stay onside orders of the court are serious matters and people who are responsible comply with them
2287272 he is a player of great talent and my client wishes he would play for them
2287273 we are prepared to continue during the course of an interlocutory argument to pay mr williams as per his payments to date 100 per cent of his contract
2287274 in other words even if he keeps playing rugby in toulon he is going to get a salary from the bulldogs
2287275 at the very least reasonable cause for apprehension that williams does not intend to play for the bulldogs although he has agreed to until 31 october 2012
2287276 the evidence before the court satisfies that williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2287277 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2287278 its been an enormous year for telecom and were really pleased to have come in in line with full guidance
2287279 clearly what happens with a stock like this is when future dividends are seen as more likely to be lower than higher the share price will adjust down and thats whats happening
2287280 in an ideal world when companies are reinvesting significant sums they are growing their earnings to at least maintain their return on capital but what were seeing with telecom is earnings decreasing and capex increasing which is about the worst combination
2287281 a lot of us feel that this is actually more of a structural change than a cyclical one

2287317 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys summers or stewarts copeland
2287318 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2287319 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2287387 its about making connections and working with what you already have our principal trusted us and allowed us to take that risk
2287388 you wont know about a technology until you start using it just go and do it
2287389 we cant wait until every condition is met to get started with technology
2287390 you have to jump in with what you have but at the same time the community needs to keep working on getting equitable access building a vision advocating for professional development funding and meeting the other essential conditions
2287391 a common language about student learning and has accelerated our use of instructional technology
2287392 you cant do that if teachers are working in isolation behind closed doors
2287393 create rituals have teachers bring examples of something cool that their kids have done build a community of practice get teachers more comfortable talking together it doesnt cost anything yet this seems to be hard for schools to do
2287394 find someone to learn with a study group or buddy in your own building or in another school
2287395 take a unit you love and talk about how you can infuse technology to enhance learning and go even deeper
2287396 show them something thats immediately accessible it needs to fit their objectives so that it validates and enhances what they are already doing
2287397 you want to start with something familiar and close to what they are already doing but so different that it can be a portal to new possibilities its about paradigm shifting
2287398 find some that relate to what you are already teaching
2287399 weve been trying to talk teachers into integrating technology into the classroom for thirty maybe forty years its not working
2287400 can we teach students to help teachers use technology more effectively in the classroom weve got twelve years of data that says we can
2287401 say to kids here are the things we imagine could happen with this technology
2287402 you should let people see the evidence that its working
2287403 i know that we all have different standards but i see shit like that and sometimes i have to think its unfair that my blog friends and i have to work so hard to have kids when this chick doesnt even want hers

2287419 kawg has a great history of serving the wheat grower from its inception through this current year
2287420 there have been many challenges as well as opportunities while engaging state and national legislators on issues that matter to kansas wheat producers
2287421 i am excited about the future for the kansas wheat industry as we assist all stakeholders through effective policy work and providing the framework for advancements in wheat research that is beneficial for the kansas wheat producer
2287422 there were some pitfalls but overall i have never seen the students more engaged the students actually wanted to come to school and stay after to film they managed themselves and i looked on in amazement and wondered why i hadnt done this sooner
2287423 the excitement for the project is increasing we are beginning to see the impact the project can have on the students and the team our abilities as educators are increasing and our students will be all the better for it

2287426 small business plays a key role in providing jobs for local communities so its vital that decision makers understand how the laws and regulations they create impact upon businesses
2287427 from pulling a beer to making sandwiches serving coffee planting trees or working in a mechanics shop well make them roll up their sleeves and get to work
2287428 its a terrific way for mps to see a small business first hand
2287429 pollies for small business puts mps at the coalface and gives business owners the chance to raise their concerns directly with their local mp
2287430 last year 83 state and federal mps took part from the major parties greens and independents including the premier and nsw opposition leader
2287431 it helps businesspeople and mps understand each other better and we should encourage and support any measures that can help achieve that
2287432 councils needs to try to get the applicant to do some work around the place
2287433 mr muir said that while the aesthetics of the centre would be stressed in considering the da the main objection remained the economic impact on the cbd and the frustration over the presentation of the building and the car park

2287438 we want real jobs and real outcomes for aboriginal people

2287532 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2287533 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2287534 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2287538 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2287539 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2287540 what happens is that the more powerful the vision of some increasingly total system or logic the foucault of the prisons book is the obvious example the more powerless the reader comes to feel insofar as the theorist wins therefore by constructing an increasingly closed and terrifying machine to that very degree he loses since the critical capacity of his work is thereby paralyzed and the impulses of negation and revolt not to speak of those of social transformation are increasingly perceived as vain and trivial in the face o the model itself
2287541 i dont want to look at him proclaims a drug free feldman whose big screen partnership with haim turned teen flicks like

2287544 when were onscreen theres no stopping us sobs feldmen his one time cohort who lives perpetually in the past
2287545 one line of defence i can suggest is to argue for genealogy as a plausible method of immanent social criticism one that can work without presupposing an independent utopian standpoint as a genealogist foucault is able to diagnose the organizing trends of our culture only because he too is subjected to them if he is then so are others borrowing from nietzsche his method is not to construct an alternative model but to get us to recognize his frustration and resentment and thereby the motivation for criticism of the present in ourselves as well foucault paints the picture of a totally normalized society not because he believes our present society is one but because he hopes we will find the picture threatening he could hope for this effect on us only if we have not been completely normalized
2287546 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms

2287560 his point is therefore that if counterfactually it could be said that the social normalizaiton were total there would be no grounds for social criticism there would be no way that the members of such a society could see themselves any differently from the way they were their perspective might seem distinguishable from that of real historical groups who show no understanding for and toleration of social differences
2287561 he knows full well that his dissenting voice is a counterexample to his own suggestion that the entire social body has become subjected to carcenal techniques and normalizing tendencies
2287562 there is also much much in our sexual selfunderstanding that is not voluntary even though to call it involuntary would miss the extent to which we form our identities by conforming ourselves over time to tacitly understood norms and generally accepted practices
2287563 as a historian he wants to point to a level below the explicit moral precepts or other factors that are for the most part reflectively available to individual agents his investigation of the underlying background of selfunderstanding is an exercise in the history of thought but thought for foucault means more than what the agents might have said explicitly about themselves
2287564 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy

2287578 scotts a great guy and did a great job but a lot of time it comes down to personalities and management style
2287579 for instance in 1961 foucault described his project in madness and civilization as an analysis of experience we must try to return in history to that zero point in the course of madness at which madness is an undifferentiated experience a not yet divided experience of division itself by the end of 1960s foucault was decrying any such attempt to recapture a zero point of human experience a search for origins smacks of anthropologism the empirical belief in a conceptual abstraction called man
2287580 they spy on each other sometimes one man says something about himself that he didnt aim to let slip and one of his buddies at the table where he said it yawns and gets up and sidles over to the big log book by the nurses station and writes down the piece of information he heard of therapeutic interest to the whole ward is what the big nurse says the book is for but i know shes just waiting to get enough evidence to have some guy reconditioned at the main building overhauled in the head to strengthen out the trouble the guy that wrote the piece of information in the log book he gets a star by his name on the roll and gets to sleep late the next day

2287582 foucaults texts often call for resistence to the exercise of power and genealogy as a method should be used to disrupt the complacent tendency to assume that the generally progressive character of present society justifies its shortcomings or at least makes its dangers less urgent
2287583 if foucaults project is to do social criticism without appealing to a utopian teleological philosophy of history his use of the rhetoric of negative or dystopian functionalism is paradoxical while dystopian stories can be told to counter the belief in utopias they are equally as mistaken as the utopian stories if the goal is to avoid all stories about where history as a whole is going

2287618 for the first time we will be able to identify the family of king tut

2287620 the use of functional rather than causal explanation standardly leads to consequences foucault himself would not accept foucaults model for analysing systems of thought seems to borrow from sociological functionalism which sees social life as systematically interconnected such that change in any part effects every other part and reconfigures the whole since each part of the social system thus appears indispensable functionalism can lead to political conservatism functionalist explanations may imply either that the whole is so powerful that attempts to bring about social improvements by particular reforms will inevitably fail or that the existent social institutions must be preserved since they are at least better than the social chaos that might result from efforts at social transformation

2287633 i m sure transcanada and conocophillips have the technical angle duly covered
2287634 it s not in their interest to have leaks on the pipeline because it impacts shipper economics and shipper confidence and therefore their returns
2287635 as far as i can see all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions these hints consit largely in saying do not look for progress or meaning in history do not see the history of a given activity of any segment of cultures as the development of rationality or of freedom do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past such purely negative maxims neither spring from a theory nor constitute a method
2287636 that has a lot to do with the pullback in commodity prices which improves the outlook for the u s economy a little bit
2287637 it is getting hit a little more so than some other currencies in recent weeks
2287638 we had the horrible employment report that cast doubt on the sustainability of canada s economic expansion
2287639 the general sense is the canadian dollar will weaken over the next year alongside moderating commodity prices
2287640 we re looking for it to get to about 90 cents us by the end of next year
2287641 we think it will stay around there maybe even weaken a bit further
2287642 we ve seen a lot of the commodity based currencies suffer during this period of the sharp reverse of fortunes in the price of many sensitive commodity prices mainly oil and natural gas
2287643 there s always volatility and this volatility is virtually unprecedented
2287644 more and more investors are coming to the conclusion that this could be a much more protracted economic downturn than had originally been thought
2287645 at least temporarily this dollar decline is a commodity play our currency is viewed as a proxy for commodity prices and oil is the bellwether here
2287646 suggests the canadian dollar should be somewhere in the mid to higher 80s cent range
2287647 sure not many people are going to be weeping about it maybe a lot of importers and cross border shoppers are sort of crying today
2287648 look at whats happened this is our god we waited for him and he showed up and saved us this god the one we waited for lets celebrate sing the joys of his salvation gods hand rests on this mountain

2287656 i wanted me to feel that there was no hiding place it was a removal of layers rather than an adding of layers
2287657 between action and cut we were in a very protected private space in which we could be really vulnerable to each other
2287658 there were very gratifying moments when she would emerge from behind the camera in tears saying in a very quiet voice i dont want to do another take
2287659 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
2287660 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
2287661 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality

2287667 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2287668 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2287669 when we envision what boston looked like one hundred or two hundred years ago we generally neglect to add in the topographical features that have been obscured by development numerous waterways some large some small drained into boston harbor or the neponset and charles rivers for the most part these waterways have been filled in paved over or diverted into sewers being diverted into a sewer was the fate of the stony brook
2287670 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2287671 the response includes information on the national cyber security center how privacy will be protected under the cnci how success of the initiative will be measured and how the department views the private sectors role in the initiative
2287672 the department chose to redact information relating to contracting at the national cyber security division the senators have asked dhs explain their reasons for the redactions
2287673 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
2287674 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
2287675 prior to this announcement committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the ncsc was itself classified
2287676 their letter to dhs in may asked for a detailed account of the departments role in the comprehensive national cyber security initiative noting a lack of information from the department in spite of the fact that the administration had claimed that cybersecurity was one of chertoffs top four priorities for 08
2287677 rod beckstrom the director of the national cyber security center in dhs continued the pattern of providing few details during his keynote at the black hat security conference thursday in las vegas
2287678 instead of getting into specifics both examples of real threats and what the government is trying to do about it he mainly talked in general terms about how businesses need to understand better the economics of security and the need to improve collaboration between people and governments throughout the world he also talked at length about abraham lincoln and george washington and how those two would have approached tech security
2287679 beckstrom started in march so hes still pretty new plus this administration has gone through cyber chiefs like spinal tap goes through drummers
2287680 so we should cut him a little slack still we couldnt help but feel disappointed by what we consider another missed opportunity
2287681 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2287682 something pretty significant exploded south and west of goderich and kincardine
2287683 if you had been in london and it was really quiet outside you should just have been able to hear the low rumble from these explosions
2287684 we have already looked during the time interval of interest
2287685 based on frequency content and the phenomenology of the signals these are not consistent from what we would expect from a meteor at all
2287686 they are not all that consistent with shock waves you would see with supersonic aircraft

2287688 robbie coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2287689 he is 16 years old lives locally travels by bicycle and burgles houses in your street
2287690 he will break windows to gain entry and ransack the property targeting electronic items cash and jewellery
2287691 because of the children and young persons act 1989 police cannot show you a picture of the 16 year old burglar operating in your neighbourhood
2287692 i always kind of feel the most stressful race is the first race of the season and the first race of a regatta
2287693 the same holds true for the first race of the olympics its been some time since lausanne world championships crews get better its exciting to get that first race you know where you stand you know what to expect
2287694 when you get out on the water its very exciting
2287695 it bring it more to the front and centre you are here and you are racing
2287696 you train as best as you can to perform your best
2287697 you cant control how other teams do we come here to win medals but at the end of the day the best you can ask for is putting your best foot forward
2287698 for sure its a different atmosphere having no teammates here
2287699 i kind of miss that camaraderie but now that im here with all the different sports i feel a big part of team canada and once you get in the ring youre by yourself anyway so im used to that
2287700 i expect the climbers to make a lot of attacks but i feel confident and im looking forward to it
2287701 fraud and a waste of resources however others including law enforcement officials say they are only enforcing u s immigration law and want to slow the tidal wave of illegals entering the united states

2287707 the flames are as high as the trees went back down and kicked back up again
2287708 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2287709 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2287710 ik kan de vader niet zijn want toen zij zwanger raakte was de affaire al voorbij

2287715 conspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name and title of the commonwealth
2287716 there is a phenomenal arrogance like a fog that has clouded peoples thinking and ability to see what is real
2287717 we have to go down in history as some of the worst messengers and president bush has been horrible everything he does deems calculated and insincere the same was true with bill clinton but he at least had the ability to seem sincere with bush people are throwing stones and tomatoes at him and he hasnt changed
2287718 to hold high us officials accountable in courts of law and if guilt is found to obtain appropriate punishments otherwise
2287719 the future will be threatened by additional examples of executive lawlessness by leaders who need fear no personal consequences
2287720 the possibility of more viet nams more iraqs and more repression
2287721 the bush administration has gotten away with thousands and thousands of murders
2287722 that will prove shocking to most of you folks in this chamber
2287723 whether democrat or republican all americans should be outraged by what the bush administration has done how dare they do what they did
2287724 with this increase the number of those using a search engine on a typical day is pulling ever closer to the 60 percent of internet users who use e mail arguably the internets all time killer app on a typical day

2287727 this guy said do you have a picture of her
2287728 tsk tsk her father must have many sheep and goats
2287729 dont ever tell me that grandpa had to walk three miles to school when he was a kid
2287730 howards theatrical experiences had been limited to playing a tree in his fourth grade play
2287731 i wanted to try out so i dragged howard along
2287732 they took one look at him he was a hunk and had that voice and they cast him and me that was the beginning of it
2287733 i was only going to stay two years while howard completed graduate school but i fell in love with the town and the people
2287734 it was shirley rominger who has since died linda glick our current theater group president jeannie vaughn germaines brother wayne germain and i who decided to form a group
2287735 the kitchen floor was still unpaved just dirt and there were no stalls in the bathroom so it was a unique experience
2287736 when i was in high school i had no desire to do theater
2287737 i was really shy and didnt like performing in front of people but i had a girlfriend at the time who was the city clerk in winters they were doing a melodrama and she said there was a role for a butler and that i would only have two lines i said it scared me to be on stage but she dared me and i went out delivered my two lines and ive been doing it ever since 27 years now
2287738 howard was more than just a director he was like a surrogate father i learned so much from him his demeanor and attitude i even learned how to tie a tie i was 28 years old at the time it was always that family atmosphere always a family group
2287739 howard and germaine are just delightful people and it reflects on their whole theater experience what loved about doing shows in winters was that it made theater fun again
2287740 i didnt know shakespeare i didnt even like shakespeare but i agreed to do the role
2287741 both howard and germaine have this love of shakespeare and of teaching and they let people explore characters now i do love shakespeare
2287742 by the time we put on our 25th play which was something like 20 years ago more than 600 people had participated
2287743 now weve done more than 100 productions and it must be up to about 1500 in terms of either acting or helping to build sets or being spear carriers or helping with costumes and this kind of thing which is pretty amazing for a town that size
2287744 were pretty much non threatening and we welcome new people without any hesitation if theres a part for them and we think theyll do well well put them on stage
2287745 they get a talent pool from within the community thats pretty consistent
2287746 we dont have a very large pool to draw from that a lot of the other local theater companies do
2287747 i attribute that to the fact that their venues are a little bit more sophisticated than the community center and there is the added distance particularly during the winter months that additional 12 miles in the fog and the rain is enough to dissuade some people
2287748 it really has a good diverse representation of community members
2287749 one of my favorites is larry justice who was the sheriff for the town for years he is a sheriff but hes so funny on stage
2287750 howard asked me if i would be interested in being on the board and i agreed
2287751 its fun but my husband might not agree since i spend a lot of time doing publicity
2287752 costuming in that play was a killer because we double cast
2287753 we tried to get the most talented kids and generally hoped theyd fit the costumes but they didnt always so i ended up making 13 matching capes for the final scene where they perform at the concert and then take the trek across the alps into switzerland
2287754 i did not sew i came from a family of beautiful seamstresses whenever i needed something i just said mom can you fix it
2287755 they were nothing but papier mache but they looked wonderful and i bought em all for 10 and weve used them many times i knew if we ever did a period play we could use them or a modern play set in an old castle weve used them for that too
2287756 one of our goals right now is to try to work with the city to come up with a performing arts center not just for us but the high school needs it the elementary school needs it parks amp rec needs it something that can be theirs and they can work with where they have graduated seating and things like that i think it will eventually come to fruition in winters because i think the town wants it and the city is behind it its just a matter of finding a suitable venue and finding enough money and getting the grants
2287757 one of our supporters arranged for an auctioneer and we raised several thousand dollars on that auction which was actually attended by a lot of dealers
2287758 were hoping to catch up with the rest of the world
2287759 i think what theyre doing is really wonderful it gives people the opportunity to do really great plays it gives people a chance to try out some of these roles so many people have this opportunity to be part of this family theyve created
2287760 performing for howard who directed all of my 25 shows there taught me some valuable life and work lessons as well as theater etiquette the confidence i gained the ability to stay calm amid chaos the ability to engage and hold an audience the importance of humor to respect others as you wish to be respected all have made me a better person and i seriously owe all of that to howard
2287761 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2287762 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2287763 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2287764 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2287765 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2287766 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2287767 as he said yesterday theres going to be a lot of good bills that come down that hell have to veto
2287768 why arent we trying to connect suburbs with urban areas the central valley with the bay area
2287769 that rail is much more achievable sooner than looking at a 30 year investment that is relying on the hope of the private sector to come in
2287770 though this might be a step in the right direction in oversight i think its the wrong direction for the needs of the state today
2287771 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2287772 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2287773 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2287774 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2287775 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2287776 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2287777 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2287778 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know

2287787 what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition
2287788 to put it out as news just two days after the lambeth conference appears to be trying to scupper the whole lambeth process we are insisting that the lambeth process was a good process and we do not want it to be damaged
2287789 at this stage it is very important that we focus on what lambeth did and not what what happened eight years ago
2287790 people can make political capital out of anything lambeth was a great achievement and we must build on that
2287791 he did not refer to the uniqueness of jesuss universal salvific significance this is the key issue in a religiously plural world if jesus is uniquely the son of god how does this relate to the salvation of those who believe in him and those who do not
2287792 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2287793 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2287794 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2287795 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2287796 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2287797 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument
2287798 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse
2287799 however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down

2287808 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2287809 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2287810 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2287811 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2287812 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2287813 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2287814 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2287815 david brooks gets high and then answers oh man does he answer this question which he actually wrote to himself after getting high too
2287816 you must remember that there have been three epochs of intellectual affectation the first lasting from approximately 1400 to 1965 was the great age of snobbery cultural artifacts existed in a hierarchy with opera and fine art at the top and stripping at the bottom the social climbing pseud merely had to familiarize himself with the forms at the top of the hierarchy and febrile acolytes would perch at his feet
2287817 in 1960 for example he merely had to follow the code of high modernism he would master some impenetrably difficult work of art from t s eliot or ezra pound and then brood contemplatively at parties about lionel trillings misinterpretation of it a successful date might consist of going to a reading of the waste land contemplating the hollowness of the human condition and then going home to drink russian vodka and suck on the gas pipe
2287818 but on or about june 29 2007 human character changed that of course was the release date of the first iphone
2287819 this transition has produced some new status rules in the first place prestige has shifted from the producer of art to the aggregator and the appraiser inventors artists and writers come and go but buzz is forever maximum status goes to the gladwellian heroes who occupy the convergence points of the internet infosystem web sites like pitchfork for music gizmodo for gadgets bookforum for ideas etc
2287820 when you first come across some obscure cultural artifact an unknown indie band organic skate sneakers or wireless headphones from finland you will want to erupt with ecstatic enthusiasm this will highlight the importance of your cultural discovery the fineness of your discerning taste and your early adopter insiderness for having found it before anyone else
2287821 maximum status goes to the gladwellian heroes who occupy the convergence points of the internet infosystem
2287822 why are folks like david brooks and richard cohen so transfixed on the idea that there cannot be any intelligent young people in our world who read books and arent generally speaking complete douchebags

2287850 jeff has already laughed a lot so hes ok i think his pride was bruised

2287854 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it
2287855 for the intention of mans heart is evil from his youth
2287856 well at least they might be teaching the children the bible
2287857 since 95 of the time people behind these ministries are evangelical or liberal christian humanists who have put the glory of god in eighth place and have put
2287858 do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen
2287859 he who began a good work in us will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus
2287860 the pagans did this type of stuff before christians therefore the church musto have copied it from the pagans
2287861 so and so had a celebration on that day and so its obvious that christians just took it and so its really pagan
2287862 we are drowning in teaching tapes we dont need anymore
2287863 aside from being one of the most poorly researched books weve run across
2287864 whoever is to become the greatest among you must become a servant of all
2287865 i read that scolari is more experienced than me what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
2287866 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
2287867 it will not be easy you expect arsenal and liverpool to improve and you would think chelsea with their experience will be there but i have to feel this team can defend its title
2287868 i have exactly the same squad as last season and i have to be confident it is not deteriorating i cannot see how that can possibly be the case
2287869 i would have concerns if my team was full of players the same age as ryan giggs but it is not
2287870 in people like anderson nani and carlos tevez we will see a lot of improvement
2287871 and the older ones have looked after themselves their concentration levels are still good and so is their desire
2287872 if you are sent back to the reserves six months after returning thats harsh
2287873 in some ways it has made things more difficult because the expectations became so high
2287874 then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the premier league title
2287875 but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way
2287876 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner
2287877 after four years and more than 200 entries to the jewelboxing blog we realized that the archives had grown a bit unruly and it was time to do some organizing
2287878 im not writing it down to remember it later im writing it down to remember it now
2287879 weve got a big job to do to get rooney ready for next week
2287880 with seven or eight days training we might make it he is doing much better the medical reports are good and we feel that hes clear of the virus
2287881 our engineers carry out all the tasks required to keep our systems running as
2287882 mark van bommel is predestined for the role since training resumed at the end of june i have been able to assess the excellent way in which he leads the team to the point that he enjoys considerable respect from all the players from the youngsters to the older ones
2287883 looking into the crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
2287884 we dont have an approved budget use the payroll system to cut your pay to minimum wage
2287885 but sir its 30 years old and written in cobol no one knows how to do that
2287886 macs in the enterprise top ten assumptions myths and misconceptions
2287887 how can people who had demanded or worked to revoke the land diversion order to the shrine board be expected to be neutral
2287888 we have come to know that these kashmiri leaders have been included in the delegation therefore we doubt the integrity of this delegation since they are responsible for the present turmoil in the state
2287889 lemon law resale notice of nonconformity or serious safety defect
2287890 there are times when the pressures on members of parliament and for that matter other people in public life do become very intense

2287893 in mice pre treated with the sirna cocktail and then infected with hiv we could not find any signs of virus for a long period of time
2287894 and when we treated mice whose immune systems had been reconstituted with t cells from an hiv infected individuals they were totally able to block expansion of the virus
2287895 you get a mouse with the immune system of a human
2287896 it would give me much more information on the effectiveness and toxicity of treatments and save time in human clinical trials
2287897 this sirna is a very interesting molecule that is actually programming cells to deal with the virus
2287898 miles de amigos de los senadores y sus simpatizantes han puesto su fe y confianza en l y l los ha decepcionado
2287899 no puedes mentir en la pol tica y pretender ganar la confianza de la gente
2287900 these people draw near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me and in vain they worship me teaching as doctrines the commandments of men
2287901 you didnt write back in christian love chadm but i love you as a christian even when you write angry things thanks to god who made me so rational and loving and self controlled unlike those angry hate spewing sinners who happen to disagree with me
2287902 im saying for every true example of heresy or apostasy on this site there are usually two or three of chriss pet peeves
2287903 the bible tells us to test things this is true
2287904 jesus ate with sinners who knew and acknowledged that they were sinners
2287905 do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who practice homosexuality nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god
2287906 for i know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh for i have the desire to do what is right but not the ability to carry it out for i do not do the good i want but the evil i do not want is what i keep on doing now if i do what i do not want it is no longer i who do it but sin that dwells within me wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this body of death thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then i myself serve the law of god with my mind but with my flesh i serve the law of sin
2287907 i refuse to accept that what gods law says about me is true
2287908 i know that what i am doing is evil but i dont care im going to do it anyway
2287909 i never said we should accept sister paula or her theology hook line and sinker
2287910 so compassion is something a person has to earn what do you want us to do gospelizer stone her
2287911 i said that the fact that we disagree with her is no excuse to treat her as less of a human being
2287912 im not that aggressive if im not hitting it that well
2287913 we want two things the lifting of the suspension and for the club to state clearly what they want
2287914 to say sorry would be to publicly admit he was at fault but he was not at fault
2287915 this is no longer a footballing issue it has become personal

2287921 isnt it a real joy to have friends from afar
2287922 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream comes true congratulations beijing
2287923 you have chosen as the theme of these games one world one dream that is what we are tonight as one world we grieved with you over the tragic earthquake in sichuan province we were moved by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people as one dream may these olympic games bring you joy hope and pride
2287924 dear athletes remember that you are role models for the youth of the world reject doping and cheating make us proud of your achievements and your conduct
2287925 the beijing olympic games is a grand celebration of sport for the world people including 1 3 billion chinese citizens the chinese government and people together with our friends from all over the world and the ioc will stage a high level olympic games with distinguishing features
2287926 our joint efforts will bring the olympic movement to new heights and make contributions to the noble cause of the development of mankind and world peace
2287927 i can see tremendous confidence in these boxers they are not worried about the draw or anything they are ready to take on anybody in the world it is a healthy sign and not overconfidence
2287928 it maybe because of the china clay that is being used it is not easy to get into a rhythm you easily miss one or two
2287929 if you see a light trace of powder you are supposed to get the kill but the referees have to be extremely sharp for that they may give one and not give another if they are not alert
2287930 we will be posting alternate designs that have been proposed shortly
2287931 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2287932 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2287933 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2287934 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than senator mccain
2287935 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2287936 which is why senator obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2287937 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2287938 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2287939 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2287940 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2287941 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2287942 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2287943 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2287944 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2287945 this movie will get you the most bang for your buck

2287949 rangarajan has submitted his resignation papers and orders have been issued to appoint suresh tendulkar to head the council
2287950 there are certain factors both domestic and external which may add to the slowdown of the growth rate but we still think that the growth rate could be 7 5 to eight per cent
2287951 there is no power since 6 p m and traffic has been held up at azampura and yakutpura due to the heavy downpour
2287952 i was held up in the traffic for almost an hour it was a total gridlock and adding to the trouble some of the vehicles got stranded on the main road itself
2287953 i hit a couple out there that might have got close to 400 today
2287954 that was the goal at the beginning of the year to make the ryder cup team
2287955 ive put myself in a situation where i have a chance you can play for your country and to do it in your home state that would be a dream come true
2287956 i really felt like i almost shot the highest score i could have shot today
2287957 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2287958 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much but if every time you hit it you hit it right where youre looking then whale away
2287959 its something we think about its a goal we want to reach but at the same time we have a lot of other stuff we are focusing on
2287960 having a successful season no matter if its a bcs game or not and winning a conference championship representing our faith and our institution the way it should be if we get a shot to play in a bcs game thats awesome and well give it our all but its the home victories and conference championships that define our program
2287961 our main focus is staying humble working hard and making sure we are doing all the right things to have a successful season
2287962 at byu we are competitors we want to be the best and succeed so its talked about but we still know we have to put in the work take every practice and every game before we can even think about getting there
2287963 start or switch to an inferior shell process in a smart way if a buffer with a running shell process exists simply switch to that buffer if a shell buffer exists but the shell process is not running restart the shell if already in an active shell buffer switch to the next one if any with prefix argument create always start a new shell
2287964 these are the times that try mens souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women
2287965 volunteering to continue to serve our nation while deployed is both noble and inspiring it is as award citations often state in keeping with the finest traditions of our military services
2287966 for i have the desire to do what is right but not the ability to carry it out for i do not do the good i want but the evil i do not want is what i keep on doing for i delight in the law of god in my inner being but i see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this body of death thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then i myself serve the law of god with my mind but with my flesh i serve the law of sin
2287967 and you were dead in the trespasses and sins and were by nature children of wrath but god being rich in mercy made us alive together with christ for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god
2287968 let us do do good to all people especially to those who belong to the family of believers
2287969 do not marvel that i said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit
2287970 i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
2287971 why does he still find fault for who can resist his will
2287972 in everything that you do do it to the glory of god
2287973 the subject was whether christians are called solely to evangelize or whether they are also called to show love and charity in the world present christianity in a positive light and do what they can to relieve suffering and misery in the here and now in addition to spreading the gospel
2287974 oh the christians have been here they left a sign
2287975 chadm did have gods permission to rebuke everyone who is not in agreement with him and it was so and where chadm is so shall barb be also and it was so
2287976 a warning on the medical sequelae resulting from the unclean habit of self abuse to wit hairy palms mental insanity and sundry other evils
2287977 none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one
2287978 something big is about to happen because of all the battles
2287979 this is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states
2287980 what we learned is that among adults with active epilepsy more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their epilepsy and thats really unacceptable
2287981 its not possible to get state of the art care
2287982 there are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder
2287983 in my own personal practice id say that i can manage at least half if not more of the patients that have seizure disorder
2287984 theres only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the neurologist
2287985 if you cant afford to buy it which is what i run into with a lot of the seizure medicine it doesnt really matter
2287986 many people with epilepsy do lead normal productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder
2287987 when you have a head injury its common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period it could be a couple of months or it could be years
2287988 we asked ourselves then what we needed to do to make us the electric power supplier of choice in northeast georgia
2287989 we came to the conclusion that customer service excellence would make us stand out
2287990 we gave employees ownership of that and we gave them all the credit for whatever recognition we received
2287991 first she loses a child then she has cancer and now her
2287992 and i dont need you and guess what im having more fun and now that were done im gonna show you tonight im all right im just fine and youre a tool so so what
2287993 glad you likeys and dont worry carey likeys too we are insane
2287994 a major step forward in our commitment to become the greenest technology company on the planet and establishes our leadership position for others in the industry and all other industries across the globe
2287995 the way energy costs are they are just not sustainable so for business to be competitive in the future we need constant supplies of green energy and so we are trying to enable that everywhere we can globally
2287996 it really worries me when companies claim they have achieved carbon neutrality when its really not possible
2287997 you have to question whether they have taken all their workers commuting into consideration and the materials involved in making a computer going all the way back to zinc mining
2287998 carbon neutrality is a large amount of greenwash computer companies should be focusing on the developments made in recent years in the reduction of harmful material inside the computers and

2288005 from a security standpoint there is a lot of opportunity for misunderstandings
2288006 for millennials there is more blurring of the lines between work and home
2288007 they tend to use what they have at home while at work and this is really forcing corporations to rethink it risk management
2288008 it was just time yesterday it looked like he was moving a little slow ive given him some time to work out of it now the last thing i want to do is leave him in there and let him get frustrated this is just a chance to get a mental break more than anything else

2288010 the kindle amazons electronic book reader and online service represents a major commitment emphasis ours by its chief executive jeff bezos to help shape the future of books so it stands to reason that there will be both software upgrades and new versions of the device
2288011 the first new model wouldnt be a big enough upgrade
2288012 but now there is a figure who has come to town who is claiming to be labrazio
2288013 theres some ambiguity as to whether or not its actually him and hes causing a lot of problems
2288014 its the point where the war really happens where the war really starts building steam
2288015 if it was possible to take that much time to do every story i would definitely choose to do it that way
2288016 and thats something i could never get away with in the comic i mean 5 pages is pretty precious in a 22 page comic
2288017 using an entire comic for setup for the next issues seems counterproductive to me
2288018 if your story is that big then maybe you should just make it a graphic novel or make it a double sized issue or something i always try to with the single issues tell a story there definitely needs to be some kind of conflict and some type of resolution to the conflict within the issue i just feel kind of cheated when i dont get that in a single issue
2288019 i think if someone picked up the first issue that i drew and then took a look at chinatown its like wow thats not even the same person
2288020 its pretty much night and day as far as my writing ability and the art has evolved so much over the 10 year span its a lot different
2288021 and the monthly storyline that im doing for this year pretty much wraps everything up that i started from the very beginning
2288022 going to be something completely different as far as the continuity of the book goes its kind of a major year
2288023 sometimes the stories are a little bit more dramatic sometimes theyre a little more on the funny side sometimes i do straight out sci fi kind of stuff and theres lots of horror and crime elements
2288024 so if i have the feeling i want to draw a giant robot then well draw a giant robot in this story i just want to keep it fresh for myself so it stays interesting and i dont get bored with it and i also think it helps the reader if they dont know what to expect i always think its more entertaining for them

2288028 fortunately the existing seismic networks on nearby volcanoes picked up the activity at kasatochi volcano
2288029 they were installed with funding from the federal aviation administration to reduce the hazard to aviation from volcanic ash these networks were crucial in recognizing that this volcano had entered the first stage of a major eruption
2288030 our hope is to have monitoring equipment on all volcanoes that pose the greatest threats to public safety
2288031 satellite imagery is useful to see the big picture of what is happening and what is going into the atmosphere but direct instrumentation such as placing seismic monitors around a volcano will help give an early warning and give people more time to plan for hazardous events
2288032 thats really good news the heating isnt normally on at this time of the year and the boiler do sweat

2288041 hes working hard again its just a steep learning curve for him
2288042 so its hard but i think hes a competitor and he can run around and hes a smart guy i think its just a question of getting the timing together and everything right now
2288043 for me its just about doing what the coaches tell me and controlling what i can control
2288044 they still practice very much the same way and ive sort of learned over the years that you need to be careful that first day of pads guys get all amped up and smack each other around and people can get hurt

2288127 i can well understand that where we are at the present time is far from satisfactory for people from england perhaps less from a northern ireland point of view and more from scotland point of view if scottish members can stop things happening in england that they enjoy in scotland then that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs
2288128 we will do what anybody would expect a mature political party to do we will look at what is in the interests of the united kingdom as a whole we will look at what is in the interests of northern ireland and we will make a decision based on that and that alone

2288163 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2288164 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2288165 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2288166 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2288190 because her supervisors denied her access to shade and water as she pruned white wine grapevines for more than nine hours in nearly triple digit heat at a central valley vineyard
2288191 while not much has been done to study the long term effects of pesticides on farm workers the research that has been done is alarming according to the american journal of industrial medicine 2001 california farm workers have elevated levels of leukemia and stomach uterine and brain cancer according to studies done in washington state by the fred hutchinson center and the university of washington 2002 2004 toxic pesticides are showing up in the bodies of farm workers who thin fruit 92 of those tested as well as their children 88 of those tested pesticide residue is moving from field to home what is so disconcerting is the fact that an estimated 1 2 billion pounds of highly toxic pesticides are sprayed on our food annually in the u s and only four states collect data about which pesticides are used where when and in what amounts farm workers are at grave risk
2288192 these hardworking youth labor under more dangerous conditions than their contemporaries working in nonagricultural settings they are routinely exposed to dangerous pesticides sometimes working in fields still wet with poison often given no opportunity to wash their hands before eating lunch they risk heat exhaustion and dehydration as their employers fail to provide enough water or any at all they suffer injuries from sharp knives accidents with heavy equipment falls from ladders repetitive motions in awkward and punishing poses can interfere with the proper growth of their bodies lack of sleep because they are working too many hours interferes with their schooling and increases their chances of injury depression affects them more often than other minors a reflection of the cumulative stresses and burdens in their young lives only 55 percent of them will graduate from high school incredibly these juvenile workers are protected less under united states law than are juveniles working in safer occupations
2288193 agriculture is consistently ranked as one of the three most dangerous occupations in the united states pesticide risks farmworkers suffer from the highest rate of toxic chemical injuries and skin disorders of any workers in the country as well as significant rates of eye injuries health concerns farmworkers face higher incidences than other wage earners of heat stress dermatitis urinary tract infections parasitic infections and tuberculosis poor health of children children of migrant farmworkers have higher rates of pesticide exposure malnutrition and dental disease than the general population children of migrant farmworkers are also less likely to be fully immunized than other children housing effects poor migrant housing conditions lead to increased prevalence of lead poisoning respiratory illnesses ear infections and diarrhea limited insurance only ten percent of farmworkers report having employer provided health insurance obstacles to health care barriers to receiving health care include lack of transportation limited hours of clinic service cost of health care limited or no interpreter service and frequent relocation in search of farm work farm workers are not protected by sick leave and risk losing their jobs if they miss work

2288195 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men

2288197 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events

2288200 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2288201 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2288202 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2288203 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2288204 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2288205 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
2288206 should the idea be introduced it will be confined to non tourist routes and flights
2288207 as long as airlines like ryanair think that the stupid ideas of gombeens regarding their body weight or whether they want to bring a reasonable piece of luggage to bring a change of clothes while on a trip is acceptable then we all better get used to travelling by ferry again and leave aircraft to skinny people who dont change their clothes

2288213 we always act as a government on the basis of our legal advice and our legal obligations the previous government took all of the information into account when they made their decision on how to proceed with the khadr case

2288217 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2288218 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2288219 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2288220 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

2288222 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions

2288262 i guess just to work hard in high school to get grants and scholarships through hard work
2288263 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2288264 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2288265 vital health care and social services are being put at risk by people who think we can balance our states budget with a cuts only approach
2288266 we need to invest in these important programs to ensure the health of seniors the disabled and other residents in our community a balanced approach of cuts closing tax loopholes and raising revenue will enable the state to put its finances in order without severely jeopardizing access to health care higher education and social services
2288267 the vast majority of emergency medical technicians are responsible hard working people who provide critical services to californians
2288268 we depend on them to respond to life threatening situations such as heart attacks gunshot wounds and car accidents but right now there is no statewide standard for background checks and before they are sent into public service we should review their history more closely given the reports of criminal history and unqualified emts who fell through the cracks
2288269 no one cares so im not writing you today im off to read kyras blog

2288278 paris barclay who directed a couple episodes of the shield was working at cold case at the time
2288279 he asked me to come in and meet with him to pitch this idea of kathryn morris character lilly rush having a boyfriend that might be on going a guy that would be good for her so in the episode of joseph he gets introduced as this guy who had taken on his brothers identity and of whom had been hiding for a year yet ends up falling in love with lilly given it was lilly who was assigned to investigate his case and that was really my first time getting to play alongside a leading lady or play a love interest because i had always played the rebellious guy who had a lot of girls but never really had a serious girlfriend
2288280 i was so up for cold case kathryn and i had really cool chemistry when we first met we used to have the same acting teacher in the early 1990s larry moss and apparently we were in class at the same time though i dont remember
2288281 we have a lot of mutual friends and we know a lot of the same people
2288282 she was also on a tv series called pensacola wings of gold for a year with james brolin
2288283 even though that whole cast got replaced by myself sandra hess and michael trucco for season two we still knew each other from that time so when we met for cold case we already had a lot in common and we just sort of clicked we played off each other really well i had no idea how it was going to come out on screen but i could feel a chemistry with her i remember the producers saying look you know weve had a lot of people with kathryn that didnt have that energy but you do so they were really happy at first and they originally had me for about 13 episodes and although i had always thought it was a really really cool show at the same time i kept thinking how am i going to fit in there what are they going to do i didnt know how far or how deep they were going to take my character and i didnt want to just be that guy the guy that every once in a while just shows up to have these little scenes together with kathryn i kind of wanted it to be a little more in depth and because i dont think they could commit to that idea given they themselves didnt know where it was going to go we kind of cut it short in five episodes
2288284 when i left the shield i wanted to be smart and whatever i was going to do next had to be equally as powerful to me in some way shape or form as it was on the shield it had to really say something one of the scripts i read was for saving grace i thought the pilot was great and of course holly hunter was attached to it i really dug the energy it spoke to me kind of like when i read the pilot for the shield i thought saving grace was different from anything i had seen and if a show like that was willing to take a chance to go down a certain road to bring up things that will make people think i wanted to be a part of it
2288285 the audition didnt come for almost a month and half to two months
2288286 i didnt hear anything about it so i went on to
2288287 it was sooo meant to be you know my manager was home sick and i thought maybe she was delusional when she called to tell me about the offer
2288288 holly had been looking for the guy and couldnt find him
2288289 i had been a fan of hers forever i loved her in the coen brothers movies raising arizona o brother where art thou to always with steven spielberg i just remember thinking man one day i would love to play opposite of that woman because she has such a beautiful energy and presence on screen so in reading for the role of ham i was totally thinking i could play this but then when i was also supposed be the love interest i was like completely having panic attacks before i met her
2288290 you never know how peoples energy are going to be together but the first time i met her to rehearse shes just got this thing that sort of melts you i remember looking into her eyes and i felt so completely safe it was just this thing where i knew it was going to be a great experience
2288291 during that first rehearsal we read through the whole script without the directors or writers even saying anything to us they just watched
2288292 and when we got done with our first read of all of the ham and grace scenes put together she looked at me and said this is not easy stuff but youre making it seem like its actually simple we obviously didnt know how it was going to go but i think there was something right away that we had with each other kind of a trusting got each other kind of thing that in turn showed up on the screen
2288293 that whole best friend testosterone thing on the shield is definitely a different bond than the one you build in a male female partnership whereby you are secretly in love with that person its actually really hard theres a lot of work put into the layers and the subtleties you know the job the partner how you feel about that person being married yet knowing that person isnt right for you not being able to confess your love to the person youre with every day even though you have sort of that unspoken understanding for me all of that has been definitely a huge shift almost like night and day with the way i approach everything
2288294 nancy miller wrote a pretty wonderful arc that includes my brother in afghanistan my other brother is in town running an art gallery and happens to be gay there are also going to be some things coming up that happen to ham that turn him into a complete basket case that really kind of find him taking the opposite role from what hes been doing especially with grace you know hes been trying to be there for her through everything trying to understand where she comes from now their roles are going to get reversed because of some things that happen to him and the places he goes both emotionally and psychologically it gets extremely dark episodes five six and seven pretty much go as dark as theyd allow on television
2288295 and how you deal or not deal with obstacle and life changing events just when you think youre ok with things or you think that youre making all the right choices in your life for the right reasons something can come and hit you in the face like a baseball bat and you cant recover things that seem solid go away and its on many different levels its not one particular event so its been interesting to see all that play out for my character
2288296 nancy miller is really beautiful about saying where do you feel you want it to go where do you feel we can improve with the characters with the show with the stories she is so open i definitely expressed a lot of things to her that she took to heart and its just pretty awesome to see it come to fruition
2288297 ham is married yet hes cheating on his wife and in complete denial about it i had a hard time talking to nancy about that saying how do i justify this without be a complete schmuck for me personally it would never happen so because its very opposite its been a challenge not personally judge myself as the character yet still try to find reasons why ham is who he is why hes caught up being in love and acting out even though hes a married man
2288298 he likes to be the best that he can be at what he does like his work you know if other parts of your life arent going well what do you fall back on if you can obsess on one thing that you become great at it takes your mind off other things where you might be lacking or definitely having problems so for me as a person i like to put my energy into being the best i can be and ham does the same thing with his work he wants to be great at what he does be helpful at what he does and contribute hes also got a sense of humor and he tries to make light of things when theyre really heavy so theres definitely human similarities that kind of crossover and then there are other ones that become deep moral choices at which point you know were two different people
2288299 my conversation with him would be like man what are you doin
2288300 no actually my conversation would go back to the loyalty thing like dude you got married to somebody if youre not happy get out of it before you go off and do your thing im personally a big believer in commitment so he needs to man up and get out thatd probably be my conversation but id also want to ask him how do you continue to have an affair without having a conscience about it or do you id want to know how a person does that how are you still married not being held accountable for an affair and simultaneously justifying that affair not that hes a schmuck or that hes even acting like a schmuck but he is acting out i understand why grace does what she does but why doesnt ham choose to clean up that other part of his life first in order to try and make it work with her id be curious to know that
2288301 oh man i know what happens and i was there for a couple of those last episodes its going to be a pretty shocking ending in a lot of ways its not going to be what people expect at all i was pretty blown away when i was told i mean i was on the episode where one thing happened and i thought they were lying to me i was like no and they were like yeah and i was like no way and they were like yeah way its pretty unbelievable and as much as people that have been following the show got affected by shane killing my character lem i think theyre going to feel as much probably more of an impact with how the shield ends creator shawn ryan is pretty genius its going to be great i think people are just going to be blown away by how it unfolds
2288302 you know these stories saying that america is preparing to go to war with iran that were going to bomb them that secret military units are running all over iran that were supporting killer fanatics that sort of thing
2288303 has increased clandestine activities inside iran and intensified planning for a possible major air attack teams of american combat troops have been ordered into iran under cover to collect targeting data and to establish contact with anti government ethnic minority groups hershs sources say that president bush is determined to deny the iranian regime the opportunity to begin a pilot program planned for this spring to enrich uranium
2288304 this summer the white house requested that the joint chiefs of staff redraw long standing plans for a possible attack on iran the focus of the plans had been a broad bombing attack with targets including irans known and suspected nuclear facilities and other military and infrastructure sites
2288305 well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america
2288306 for which the president sought up to four hundred million dollars
2288307 the new task force will work with the m e k the administration is desperate for results
2288308 attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice
2288309 too many people believe you have to be either for or against the iranians
2288310 lets get serious eighty million people live there and everyones an individual the idea that theyre only one way or another is nonsense
2288311 just because lebanon iraq and pakistan have ethnic problems it does not mean that iran is suffering from the same issue
2288312 iran is an old country like france and germany and its citizens are just as nationalistic
2288313 well mr hersh it seems youre an obsessive compulsive neurotic doesnt it you keep writing the same story over and over again with minor variations year after year
2288314 you need to stop what you are doing on the web
2288315 what the who do you think you are telling me what i can do

2288319 molybdenum is trading at around us 33 85 lb but we see it moving up into the us 40 lb range in 2009 because there is a stranglehold on molybdenum supply
2288320 stainless steel demand is huge particularly in the natural resources field for pipelines natural gas anything that requires anticorrosive material needs molybdenum in it
2288321 once a lot more of these molybdenum projects get on line in 2011 12 then youll probably see the price come back down to the us 25 30 lb range but in the interim theres a lot of potential molybdenum producers that just arent getting permits and that wont be online as quickly as they thought

2288327 the small weights wrestled first so i had some time i wanted to be all by myself i said im going up to the top bleachers i went up up up until i reached the last row if i stood on my toes i could touch the ceiling i was all alone just the way i wanted
2288328 while i was going down these steps i said oh my god all of these guys that i have seen in my weight i can beat every one of them
2288329 i told myself that i was going to wrestle this turk so hard that he will run out of gas and wont be able to keep up with me energy wise

2288386 before a series of ufo reports in france in 1954 we rarely received reports of sightings from people driving along in cars it was from people flying in airplanes
2288387 if people see something they cant explain they try to fit it into existing patterns even something reported by others they dont have the mental discipline to look at something and not commit to what it is
2288388 the basic belief behind a car stop is that an electromagnetic em field dampens the cars electrical system and the engine effectively stops when reports began to come in about these encounters we find that people driving cars with diesel engines didnt report car stoppages while people with regular car engines did that supports the idea that something is happening because people just making up stories wouldnt originally make a distinction between diesel and non diesel engines

2288451 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

2288454 differences in the attitude respectively of apolitical middle class prisoners mostly jews and prisoners with a genuine political conviction or religious conviction or both demonstrate that the values and convictions of prisoners do make a critical difference in the reaction to conditions of the concentration camp that are common to all of them
2288455 contradicts the behaviorist thesis haney et al tried to prove with their experiment
2288456 but this does not imply that their reaction is only a function of their character and not one of their environment
2288457 first the fact that the spe can be critiqued at all is evidence for its significance as karl popper argued a statement is scientific if it can be falsified
2288458 zimbardo did select his subjects young white male stanford students so he cannot claim that his results apply to all people
2288459 many studies have small sample sizes so this is relatively unimportant
2288460 if a replication of the original experiment shows different results the original experiment might not have measures what we thought we were measuring
2288461 it takes more than the situation to create what was observed in the spe and abu ghraib
2288462 given the limitations of a cross sectional study with a small sample size the results from this survey suggest a demonstration rather than a conclusive test of the validity of this model
2288463 have we learned something from zimbardos spe of course we have but this does not mean that it is valid as a scientific experiment that is used in the course of theory building of course experiments can be used to explore areas of knowledge to expand our knowledge base but you cannot use the results of one badly designed experiment to support your theory as zimbardo does

2288512 americans have been crying out asking us to act to lower high gas prices and they just heard the official response from the democrat leadership in congress a few new guidelines for the energy futures market is enough we dont need to do anything other than that thats it
2288513 the american people have been telling us for months that the house is on fire and the democrats just showed up at the scene with a squirt gun
2288514 the vote we just took was their response to 4 a gallon gasoline thats what a few of our friends on the other side are doing for all those people out there who are standing at the gas pump hopping mad at what it just cost them to fill up their tank
2288515 to drive down gas prices we could be lifting the ban on the development of vast oil shale deposits in western states that sit on three times the reserves of saudi arabia the democrat leadership says no we cant
2288516 to drive down gas prices we could have voted to open up untapped american oil today but the democrat leadership says no we cant
2288517 to drive down gas prices we could have voted today for new clean nuclear technology but the democrat leadership says no we cant
2288518 nearly eight in 10 americans say we should do these things but the democrat leadership and their presidential nominee has the same simple response to every one of them no we wont
2288519 i know my colleagues across the aisle are stuck between the no we cant position of their presidential candidate and the democrat leadership stuck between them on the one side and the guy at the gas pump with smoke coming out his ears but for me that decisions an easy one im with the guy at the pump
2288520 to drive down gas prices we could have approved new coal to liquid technology today but the democrat leadership says no we cant
2288521 i mentioned yesterday that i recently received a letter from a dialysis center in kentucky
2288522 and so i ask my friends on the other side the same simple question i asked them yesterday if you wont act now with dialysis patients cutting back on treatments because of high gas prices when will you what is it going to take
2288523 americans are insisting we do more they want us to do something to cut the price of gas and lessen our dependence on middle east oil they dont want us to quit working until the job is done and leaving this issue is what the democrat leadership just voted to do
2288524 a majority in the senate wants america to be self reliant and to find more american energy but the democrat leadership says no we cant
2288525 to drive down gas prices we could have approved incentives for battery powered electric cars and trucks today the democrat leadership says no we cant
2288526 americans are insisting we do more they want us to do something to cut the price of gas and lessen our dependence on middle east oil they dont want us to quit working until the job is done and leaving this issue is what the democrat leadership just voted to do

2288589 alte waffen f r die junge demokratie bereiten die usa georgien auf einen krieg vor
2288590 betrug das wachstum des georgischen milit rhaushalts 2005 mehr als 90 prozent und erreichte 250 millionen us dollar der umfang der milit rischen hilfe von seiten der usa stieg um mehr als das doppelte auf 74 millionen us dollar an
2288591 einige nato mitgliedsl nder die heute mit dem modewort junges europa bezeichnet werden liefern waffen an georgien die seinerzeit von der sowjetunion an diese l nder mit dem verbot ihres reexports geliefert worden waren
2288592 besser ist bankrott zu werden als die hasser russlands zu bewaffnen
2288593 von wem georgien waffen erwerben oder diese waffen geschenkt bekommen wird
2288594 mir ist unbekannt dass irgendwelche diesbez glichen sanktionen gegen georgien verh ngt wurden
2288595 es ist absolut korrekt und richtig den l ndern der neuen demokratie waffen zu bergeben ein teil der waffen wurde im vorigen jahrzehnt auch litauen geschenkt
2288596 es ist offensichtlich dass saakaschwili die absicht hat gegen jemanden krieg zu f hren
2288597 eine analyse der bilanz der u eren und inneren bedrohungen georgiens zeigt dass die georgische f hrung darauf aus ist die gekauften offensivwaffen keinesfalls gegen die t rkei armenien oder aserbaidschan einzusetzen au er s dossetien abchasien und russland hat es niemanden gegen den es einen krieg f hren k nnte dabei bereitet sich georgien auf diesen krieg mit mitteln der usa und mit stillschweigender billigung durch die nato vor das kann man wohl kaum f r einen freundschaftlichen schritt gegen ber russland halten
2288598 wenn man den erkl rungen saakaschwilis glauben schenkt dass er ausschlie lich friedliebend eingestimmt sei so muss man schlussfolgern dass all diese k ufe aus dem fenster geworfenes geld sind denn die panzer granatwerfer und jagdflugzeuge haben keine andere bestimmung au er der hauptbestimmung
2288599 sich die situation in georgien in richtung auf ein m gliches blutvergie en entwickelt und die georgische f hrung die wiederherstellung der territorialen integrit t auf milit rischem wege anstrebt

2288662 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar said ashraf laidi a currency strategist at cmc markets
2288663 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in us fundamentals

2288674 but as happened with the rtc the public cost could be minimised

2288683 i held out so i missed the first preseason game and didnt actually play until the second one jags head coach tom coughlin didnt like that too much i picked off a pass i dont know who it was from but it was to joe horn
2288684 thats right 1 0 but its 1 0 in the preseason does it count
2288685 either way it was neat to see a football team flying around
2288686 weve got a bunch of competitors i knew that about the ravens and now to see it and all the coaches in there competing thats for a head coach thats strong
2288687 i never played in an nfl stadium and i never played in an nfl game it felt pretty good i got the jitters out and got the first one out of the way but you do catch yourself looking around and checking out the situation it was like theyre the patriots you have always got to look at them and say were playing the patriots whether its the preseason or the regular season they are the patriots
2288688 just the fact that you are about to play against nfl players was on my mind
2288689 thats just cool thats a cool thing for me you have to realize that youre one of them now and that you belong here thats what ive been trying to tell myself throughout this whole process i belong here this is football and im going to go out and do my job
2288690 i have no apprehension at all insisted delhomme who underwent months of grueling rehabilitation following ligament replacement surgery
2288691 i dont know if im being naive but i dont feel that way
2288692 i have done a bunch of interviews and they are like were you nervous to throw the ball or let it loose
2288693 when we started throwing nobody was around it wasnt like it was april and guys are working out or may and we have minicamp and im trying to push it i didnt have to push it because nobody was there so that worked in my favor
2288694 it always hurt to practice but it just didnt feel right delhomme said
2288695 i remember vividly talking to my wife on a friday afternoon and she asked how was practice and how is the arm i said it was miserable this week i dont know it was just miserable this week your body just tells you sometimes
2288696 i didnt have the pain during the night or waking up in the morning i didnt have the pain of when i would grab certain things i didnt have that anymore that was more mentally refreshing than anything else
2288697 i think most players ive seen as you get older you realize your years might be numbered tackle jordan gross said
2288698 im not saying jake is done anytime soon but i think he knows hes comfortable here hes enjoying it his elbow feels good and hes definitely having a lot of fun
2288699 this is my 12th nfl camp and im not going to 12 more delhomme said
2288700 i enjoy it i like the guys on this team and i like the coaches i think most of the guys as they get older tend to enjoy it because you realize how blessed you are to play this game
2288701 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2288702 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2288703 franchise player would sign with another team for 2009 agr announced the 33 year old brazilian has signed a five year contract extension through 2013

2288705 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2288706 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2288707 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had he said
2288708 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2288709 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year the elder andretti said
2288710 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2288711 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders green said
2288712 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2288713 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page andretti said friday
2288714 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes
2288715 but i would say most of the races we have worked together and those were where we had our best races thats constantly a challenge obviously you have four drivers that want to win sometimes youve got to remind them that if they all work together that all four can get better
2288716 es war eine gro e herausforderung mit so vielen menschen zu arbeiten und es ist eine gro e befriedigung das alles so gut geklappt hat

2288800 we have an emerging enemy in our war against illegal drugs north korea we have a strong suspicion that the illegal drugs in subic came from north korea

2288802 information sharing is a strategy as important as strategies in reduction of demand and supply in this war on drugs illegal drug syndicates operate without borders not national boundaries so our responses against them should also be borderless and transnational

2288817 the penalties and fines provided for under the present ra 6969 are not commensurate to the gravity and seriousness of the dangers that toxic substances and hazardous and nuclear wastes bring to health and environment it is therefore imperative that ra 6969 be amended to impose stricter and stiffer penalties and fines in order to give more teeth to the law

2288920 i just love working with musicians and singers and ive done nothing on this scale
2288921 and thats fine with me because that means that other teams that want to scout me will never find us here
2288922 we are a real high school football team were just giving these kids an opportunity to play that would normally never have it

2288935 the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the u n security council to call on russia to reverse course

2288939 the scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
2288940 the challenge we face now is how to translate advances made in our understanding of the virus and the human immune responses to it into promising vaccine candidates as quickly and safely as possible
2288941 developing a preventive hiv aids vaccine is going to be much tougher than we originally thought
2288942 the world is now relying on the talents resources and energy of researchers doctors policy makers activists and other stakeholders from both the developed and the developing world
2288943 we need as many people as possible committed to helping us reach this goal
2288944 we will keep using speed flexibility and focus to drive forward aids vaccine science and testing
2288945 we will keep an aids vaccine on center stage as a long term solution to this devastating public health problem

2288960 we have had an e mail in the last 48 hours saying we are part of a big ticket scam and now they do not have the tickets
2288961 we are feeling pretty despairing as we do not know what to do and just want to watch her swim
2288962 the ticket scam has robbed us of the chance to see becky hopefully fight for a medal
2288963 we may have to get some tickets from touts which you are told not to do
2288964 the finality of the death penalty makes it essential that it is applied with scrupulous attention to safeguards set down in international law
2288965 one of those safeguards is that foreign nationals should have access to consular services that is crucial for the protection of all individuals who travel abroad
2288966 john the baptist sent us to you to ask are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else

2288968 go and tell john the things you have seen and heard that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have the gospel preached to them notice carefully verse 23 and blessed is he who is not offended because of me
2288969 in the present case i advise you leave these men alone let them go for if their purpose or activity is of human origin it will fail but if it is from god you will not be able to stop these men you will only find yourselves fighting against god
2288970 since we found it within four years its now spread the whole length of the soar
2288971 one single little leaf can by the end of the summer grow into 20 tonnes
2288972 the only way to deal with it now is to get people in with hands to pick every last piece
2288973 its a very slow job but its got to be done or else were going to lose the whole of the river
2288974 we estimate that on the river soar alone its going to cost us 50 000 this year just to deal with this floating pennywort and that will be every year
2288975 we will have finished all the work and as far as possible we will have removed all the barriers and all the equipment
2288976 the work itself is very expensive because we have laid the concrete foundation and then the tiles on that
2288977 so we have got a structure now which is not going to move
2288978 previously we have always found that when they are laid on sand the slabs rock then people trip over them then we have to go back and re lay them

2288984 shows an enormous disappointment with the establishment and with justice in mexico the people know there is no protection for the poor
2288985 it also shows alienation with the catholic church people are fed up with going to church and being told what to do sit down kneel stand up then they get asked to give money and get nothing back

2288992 he will be appearing at hena home education network of arizona conference at the asu college of education tempe arizona the weekend of march 1st and 2nd
2288993 before me is a request to release the suspects on the condition that they are expelled from judea and samaria for the period of 90 days a bond and a third party guarantee and that they will appear before the police when called
2288994 the expulsion from judea and samaria is until oct 10 2008 except for the area of their homes the personal bond and the third party guarantee is set at 10 000 2 942 shekels each to ensure the conditions for their release and they will appear before police when requested
2288995 but we have his details and he will reach us through the sheikh
2288996 the evidence that we have is that of the complainants themselves who pointed to the jewish residents
2288997 for example ostrovsky was in the area with his big mixed breed canani dog he was with al the group but they bedoiun didnt say that he caused any damage but he was with the others on this hike regarding the suspect davis he said he didnt do anything but afterwards he refused to cooperate with the investigation
2288998 they brought a bedouin into the investigation room and he pointed
2288999 they police said because i was part of the group so i was responsible for what happened
2289000 about efrion they said that he was with the others and he had an m 16 rifle
2289001 none of them was identified as someone who punctured tires or threatened with weapons but everyone said they were in the area
2289002 we are speaking about a hike that is organized for the purpose of causing damage and destruction
2289003 i know that next week there is going to a similiar exhibition hike i believe that the decision of the court will have consequences and an influence and they will learn how to behave because of this decision and if the court will agree to our request this will prevent phenomenon like these
2289004 we havent received a complaint but on the face of it it appears that there is a lack of justice
2289005 no person shall pass the roadblock unless he has permission from me or from someone whom i have authorized
2289006 this is required for security purposes and for maintaining public order
2289007 its good that an extreme officer has reduced to the absurd the legal status that exists in judea and samaria whereby hundreds of thousands of jews are living under military rule and are subject to his impulsive mood swings
2289008 the army rushes too quickly to issue closed military zone orders and to prevent the entrance of israelis into the area
2289009 we need those democrats in the house to do the responsible thing and provide funding so that decisions like that dont have to be made
2289010 how often does he go to the state capitol or the state of illinois building
2289011 i am not about to get criticized by a ghost payroller
2289012 it was a level we couldnt even match from the first minute to the last minute
2289013 they geelong used the ball well and they moved the ball quickly
2289014 they were intent and the first quarter was all about them and it was almost boys playing against men bigger bodies around the ball better decisions kicking easy goals in conditions that were slippery
2289015 it was incredibly disappointing on a very important night for the melbourne football club they really made us look second rate
2289016 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
2289017 we going to get it on because we dont get along
2289018 it may not be in five years but it will certainly be within a decade china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
2289019 i dont think the success of cricket in china depends on having hundreds of thousands of people playing it in the park on a saturday afternoon i think it depends on promoting it as a television product
2289020 look at india and the commercialisation of cricket there there is no reason why that cant happen in china its a growing economy its a changing economy but its also an economy that is becoming an avid consumer of western culture
2289021 whats in it for cricket there is so much competition for all types of sports now and cricket is no different to any other product in the sense that it cant afford to ignore china
2289022 we think this is one of the most important changes to the way were policing since perhaps the launch of radios because were going to be enabling our officers to have a complete mobile office while out on patrol
2289023 we will increase visibility and accessibility to the public and also cut down on bureaucracy
2289024 in 12 months or sooner if requested by the government of iraq
2289025 this shows the support of the international community for what they are doing
2289026 the iraqi government is willing to protect the un and has expressed readiness to contribute financially to the building of the new un headquarters in baghdad
2289027 we hope they the un will re open their offices in different parts of iraq
2289028 the renewal of the un mandate in iraq is positive we welcome it
2289029 we still support the process of prosecution through serious crime unit investigation
2289030 ctf is only one mechanism of addressing or looking what atrocities may have happened in the country but there is also something called prosecution
2289031 we are not going to comment in detail on every single aspect of the files
2289032 kate and gerry are as innocent today as they were on 3 may 2007 and if this number of people were in the apartment before the searches then i think people will draw their own conclusions about the strength of any material that was recovered

2289046 for over 20 years abu khabab has been teaching and training the mujahideen youths who graduated from his school and became experts in the same field
2289047 he may have dropped the banner but a whole generation of young believers have picked it up

2289049 what will my enemies do to me my death is martyrdom and martyrdom is the greatest and highest of our desires and what you hate is what we desire and how beloved is paradise and its nearness pleasant and cool are its drinks and if the kings and the sons of kings knew what we are in they would have fought us over it with swords and if our enemies knew in what pleasantness and amusement and happiness we dwell they would die of depression

2289052 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2289053 we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight

2289055 we will not allow their deaths to go unpunished those responsible will receive a deserved punishment
2289056 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming
2289057 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2289058 i didnt think the captaincy affected me because before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work i normally do
2289059 in terms of me and how ive been playing i have been getting hundreds and scoring runs
2289060 there was a lot of scrutiny that went with this match but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday
2289061 i just went out and expressed myself today knowing i needed to score some runs and we needed to get a lead
2289062 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can
2289063 i built an innings played straight played in my areas played a few shots which were funky i suppose but just got on with it
2289064 in terms of my relationship with the players i have to keep growing that
2289065 that has come on leaps and bounds in the four days i have been in charge
2289066 i am getting to learn a lot more about how the guys operate and you have a really different perspective
2289067 you really want them to do well for them for you the team its really a holistic thing
2289068 i wasnt happy with myself for getting out then but im very happy with the situation the team is in and how we performed
2289069 my first two days have been great ive just tried to go out and play my normal game
2289070 the local community is no more engaged with the communities first process than it was before the review and key local service provider organisations remain disengaged
2289071 the long running situation in west rhyl bears little resemblance to practice anywhere else in the programme and does not accord with the principles set out in the communities first guidance
2289072 discussions have started across the welsh assembly government to consider how community regeneration in this area can be incorporated in a wider programme of economic and social regeneration in rhyl
2289073 the job of making communities first sustainable in rhyl was made all the more difficult by denbighshire county councils lack of commitment to its goals
2289074 the authority has drastically cut the community development agency after actively instructing it to avoid communities first
2289075 this typifies the lack of engagement experienced in rhyl thus stalling efforts to rejuvenate the scheme
2289076 denbighshire expresses disappointment that the communities first programme for west rhyl has been unsuccessful but we are pleased to hear that this money will not be lost to rhyl
2289077 regarding comments made about the reduction of posts at the denbighshire community agency this decision was taken following the poor settlement from the welsh assembly government

2289083 no i am not i will be rendered useless and helpless whenever i am met with a strong wall i cannot penetrate the wall so the wall is the strongest
2289084 while we do support an investigation we dont believe that all the facts were properly aired in this case
2289085 does not sufficiently take into account the situation on the ground
2289086 this was a premeditated attack on the international personnel in kosovo
2289087 the demonstrators had access to long barreled weapons to petrol bombs to grenades these are not things found lying around the average courtroom
2289088 it would appear that the accused were only given access to lawyers after the trials began confessions were obtained while the accused were held incommunicado and in the absence of legal counsel and the court did not investigate allegations of ill treatment
2289089 in capital punishment cases especially the government has an obligation to rigorously observe all fair trial guarantees set out in the international covenant on civil and political rights to which sudan is a state party

2289121 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2289122 what the hackers did was they sat in a parking lot or somewhere adjacent to where the stores were and used very basic wireless technology to attach themselves to the wireless networks and from there they could see all the systems and gather all the data

2289138 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of las vegas nevada politics studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
2289139 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
2289140 without the awesome las vegas nevada politics studies of fredenburg bohringer this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the las vegas nevada politics world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few
2289141 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
2289142 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
2289143 im happy to see that young people are interested in our las vegas nevada politics studies
2289144 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
2289145 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable las vegas nevada politics researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog

2289154 ive meant to say this before but not go around to it i really appreciate the structured lessons and appropriate work you leave for relievers the instructions are always clear and all bases covered thanks denise
2289155 repeatedly lied during his presidential campaign about an extramarital affair with a novice film maker
2289156 made a point of telling woodruff that his wifes cancer was in remission when he began the affair with hunter
2289157 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2289158 its completely untrue ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2289165 its thanks to his creativity and by collecting many artefacts and advising on furnishings that the building now tells its own story
2289166 anything that is very precious or delicate has been put in a place that cant be got to easily
2289167 the important thing for our guys to remember is to remain focused on the process and not the outcome
2289168 weve done a great job at doing that a lot of people want to guess how many wins you will have or wont have i have no idea but i do know this were going to have a better team this year than we had last year
2289169 its really quite different because i feel like were talking more about how to attack defenses rather than heres what you do at this spot or wondering who is going to be playing this spot
2289170 we know who our tailback is we know who our quarterback is going to be we know who our wide outs are and theres some great competition at those spots
2289171 weve got people in those spots at this time last year 51 of our 85 players on scholarship had never taken a snap of college football before now theyve got some experience and i think its going to show up i hope people see a smarter football team this year
2289172 having greg back there and being pushed by guys like ryan houston and devon ramsay thats going to be good
2289173 but theres no doubt we dont want it to be by committee we want a guy and greg gives us a durable strong guy that can break some long runs
2289174 as he and i talked when youre not allowed to do one thing your other senses seem to become keener this is a guy who has just worked his tail off in the meeting room and then this summer out on the field throwing hes doing a great job of diagnosing defenses and really studying defenses right now
2289175 what separates him from other guys is hes got an unmatched work ethic
2289176 ive coached a long time and youre not going to find guys with better work habits than him they dont come any better and thats going to serve him well for a long long time
2289177 what people dont realize is thats how work habits present themselves in ways that the common fan doesnt see its durability and endurance things like that go a long way to a great football player having a long career
2289178 theres a lot of big guys in the world what there isnt is guys that have those habits like he has anybody wants to know the tempo of a drill in practice i tell them to watch garrett because hell show you
2289179 carl gaskins will be a fine player for us in the offensive line
2289180 he may not be starting for us this year but hes gong to be a fine player at the wide out spot rashad mason was a red shirt last year hes got all the talent in the world whenever he buys in and prepares like hes able to theres no reason why he cant be a fine player for carolina devon ramsay was a scout team tailback for us last year if you ask the defense who they least like to tackle they name him
2289181 reaching across boundaries of politics religion geography and history i am just one man in just one country who started this foundation to send athletic equiptment around the world to bring us all together and remind us that we are on this big planet together let us forgive those that went before us who hated each other and hurt each other and let us now instead pick up a soccer ball play a game together anywhere around the world my heartfelt greetings to my new friends i may never meet in afghanistan and on behalf of the project active foundation may these shoes carry you on a peaceful journey through life filled with love joy happiness and sport

2289189 im learning something new every single day i know for a fact when i get out of the pool in two or three hours from here im going to be taking away something new that i hadnt thought of before
2289190 and if thats the case i dont know how people can say to someone at 22 or 23 are you not finished with that yet
2289191 i dont feel there is any age limit look at mark foster too at 37 hes still getting faster
2289192 anyone i race against i feel its down to hard work i cant go out to the olympics and be saying this guy is on something and that guy is taking something
2289193 i know there are going to be way harder things to deal with
2289194 i missed athens by 4 of the second and i had to back away from the sport for a time
2289195 i lived a college life for a while because i felt that if i got straight back in the pool after missing the olympics it would have been because of an anger and not a passion for the sport
2289196 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2289197 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2289198 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2289199 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2289200 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home

2289214 es la primera vez que nos hemos implicado en la distribuci n pero no hab a otra opci n porque los inversores en sundance cre an que iban a perder su dinero
2289215 trabajos que jam s hubiera imaginado como negociar mano a mano con las compa as que dise an los carteles de las pel culas o las que los colocan en los taxis de nueva york
2289216 es dif cil pero no imposible nos dimos cuenta que pod amos hacer lo mismo que hacen las grandes distribuidoras se trata de contratar a las mismas personas que trabajan para ellos y es algo que se puede hacer por menos dinero del que se piensa
2289217 por menos dinero del que un estudio dice porque son los estudios los que suben los precios
2289218 ha sido como un ultramarat n pero hacer una pel cula no es barato y qu menos que lograr una distribuci n digna podr a decir que distribuir una pel cula es m s dif cil que dirigirla
2289219 lo m s complicado es que la gente se entere de que una pel cula existe y eso es lo que vale m s dinero
2289220 pero parece que hemos encontrado a los mejores profesionales en ese sentido
2289221 hemos aprendido mucho en el a o que hemos invertido en este proyecto hemos estudiado mucho para saber qu pasos dar as que ahora vamos a seguir ese camino

2289232 the world is confusing enough without breaking stories mysteriously rewriting themselves from one moment to the next i blame cory doctorow posted by elfgirl at 12 31 pm on august 5
2289233 its very surreal a lot of guys have put more effort and a lot more time into this than i have for some this is their third olympics for some its their second olympics but its my first and its come quite quickly this is only my third year of international rowing in the four and im just taking it as it comes just enjoying it yet going out to do the best that i can
2289234 its pretty spectacular three boys from the same town are going to the olympic games in the same year and in the same event rowing
2289235 two of us are in the same boat class for two different countries its amazing how weve all come through the same system with bobby platt
2289236 now were going to the olympic games to try and achieve something big you cant really put it into words
2289237 as soon as i started getting into international rowing and competing a little bit more then i started to know who he was
2289238 i started to look up to him at the 2004 olympics and hes the guy you aspired to be like
2289239 ive the utmost respect for him and he is still the guy i look up to
2289240 whenever we go out to race theres obviously that little bit of rivalry about but i want to race him for the respect i have for him and the respect i have for his crew
2289241 in munich last year the difference between us winning gold and the irish not qualifying coming 12th was less than five seconds thats what youre looking at
2289242 and even this year its a lot tighter its down to about three seconds to win a lightweight event youve got to have a perfect race on the day some people can get that some people cant
2289243 i think to be to be an elite sportsman at this level youve got be a grafter it doesnt come easy to anyone
2289244 you might have a good physiological basis or you might have a good strength basis but to be at the top level youve got to work quite hard for it and youve got to graft and its the same in technique
2289245 youve got to keep plugging away at it stroke by stroke outing by outing we do 15000 strokes a week and youre never going to be perfect at the end of that so its hard work
2289246 mum dad my sister rebecca whos never actually been to an international rowing event before my brother peter and my girlfriend abi are all coming out to china to see me
2289247 im looking forward to having them out there experiencing the olympic games as a family every four years weve sat and watched it on the tv and now as a family were going to experience it ourselves its different its an incredible feeling
2289248 for every sportsman who wants to do well theyve got to aim right at the top
2289249 for a footballer its the world cup final for a rower its got to be the olympic games and youve got to aim right at the top and set your goals as high as you can
2289250 its six minutes of your life six minutes of that day and thats nothing in the grand scheme of a 24 hour day so you get on and do it its one of the most painful things you do some say its worse than child birth but i dont know you just got to get on and do it

2289253 while we reported a net loss we measure our financial performance based on certain cash flow metrics including ebitda which was very strong in the second quarter despite the decrease in investment revenue as a result of our newly adopted investment policy and the repositioning of the investment portfolio our strong cash flow will support capital spending to rapidly grow our agent network and to invest in the infrastructure to support our 2008 growth plans

2289265 what do you say when you see bodies all over the place and screaming for help and theyre talking a language you dont understand
2289266 we must trust in god and put the people in gods hand and pray just pray for them

2289286 id rather look at the stats more closely tied to span gomezs individual performance
2289287 i refuse to see him and i wont even speak to him
2289288 talks about his private pleasures like being able to travel around without an idf drone following him like the occupation is over like everything is fine it was nice to believe in the fairy tale but there are no fairy tales in the resistance zubeidi is a disgrace to the resistance we are still living under an occupation

2289292 i did feel a bit out of place when i was ignorant of the facts about homosexuality i can never forget the overwhelming feeling of self pity and hatred i had i mean we all grow up thinking we are straight and when things dont really fall in the desired place its natural for someone to feel out out of place essentially because of the dearth in those times about 4 years ago complete absence of support groups or a positive social discussion platform

2289299 i trained in italy for quite a while and have been practising here since the last 10 days i did all i could and think all would depend on how i fare on the day of the competition

2289334 they have blown 19 leads after the 7th inning this year
2289335 if that team wins a championship its not like you can sell 50 thousand seats in a 40 thousand seat stadium
2289336 comparing us to the red sox or yankees is silly much different markets
2289337 this team has a goal of just contending for the cheapest price possible
2289338 we have won the case as the court has ordered a permanent injunction on the scenes which mock the actor now we are planning for a criminal case

2289349 you are right j rg in stating that there is a great deal of excitement building here in germany re barack obamas visit to berlin
2289350 i think that many people will attend out of curiousity did i spell that right
2289351 obama is young and dynamic and exotic and has fresh ideas
2289352 mccain is old and tired and a typical american and will just continue president bushs disastrous foreign policies
2289353 n tv has wall to wall coverage of the obama visit to berlin and ive just watched an interesting lunch hour interview with former u s ambassador to germany john c kornblum clinton administration re this visit
2289354 there is quite a bit of excitement everywhere in germany today and the media coverage is absolutely massive
2289355 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2289356 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2289357 its important especially for the first two or three races when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2289358 from my own experience now it can be different for others but as the season wears on and those final 10 races wear on youre really just looking at the total and where its at
2289359 you have so many other things on your mind that the seeding process is kind of at the bottom of the totem pole even though it is an important factor but you just start worrying about whats ahead and those challenges that you have at the track but hes definitely going to have a margin going into it and the way those guys have been and how good theyve been were all going to have to show up on our game to beat them
2289360 i dont think about it that much to be honest with you
2289361 i just give it everything i can every lap and if its for a win great
2289362 and i hope that never changes if that does change and i make bad decisions then ill probably think a little bit more but right now i just try to keep things as simple as possible i try to lead a lap to get the bonus and try to lead the most laps if i can and try to finish as good as i can without sticking it in the fence and without not finishing the event
2289363 oh yes thats a steam shovel thats a potty thats a quartz crystal thats my first day of nursery school

2289371 he did have an affair with 42 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2289372 is that supposed to make it ok that he didnt love her what an immoral ass
2289373 is that supposed to make it ok that he didnt love her what a liberal democrat
2289374 why do conservatives hate children freedom puppies etc so much
2289375 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that
2289376 edwards also denied he was the father of hunters baby girl frances quinn although the one time democratic presidential candidate said he has not taken a paternity test

2289380 in the beginning gay men in places like san francisco and new york proved we could do prevention when we moved from that and started talking about the broad scope of the epidemic suddenly men who have sex with men became marginalized
2289381 they havent lived through the earlier days of the epidemic
2289382 this is a virus that is transmitted more easily via anal sex than vaginal sex
2289383 why do i need a dvr expander when ive got an unused external pc hard drive couldnt i just plug it into the dvrs usb port
2289384 texas should stay the execution of medell n not only out of respect for the international court of justice but also out of respect for the u s congress
2289385 the u s would expect no less of mexico or any other signatory of the vienna conventions
2289386 there are very solid reasons to grant medell n a reprieve
2289387 as long as ive been involved in alvin little league for about 25 years now this is the only team that has gone farther than any previous team
2289388 the only other team that had gotten out of sectionals was the current high school group which was about six years ago as 12s they got to state but didnt win it
2289389 they never give up and that is the one thing you can say about this team
2289390 this is the first team to make it to the world series they are the first to be a state winner and a region winner as well
2289391 i dont care if we play the martians it is what you do between the white lines that matters
2289392 one of the strengths of my team is our first four hitters who hit for power and average
2289393 trey williams who has a couple of no hitters jacob campbell our catcher gavin peltier who has also made some nice diving catches in center field and our main one is payton osbon our second baseman
2289394 payton is the type of kid that will come into the dugout and sit next to a kid who just made an error and real calmly just try to pick him up
2289395 he will not criticize him but just tell him nicely
2289396 these are my four horses and our four spark plugs for this team
2289397 the reason weve made it this far is because this is a fundamentally sound team
2289398 they practice hard and that has translated over to the field i give all the credit to the kids and yes i pushed some buttons here and there but i cant go bat for them or take the field
2289399 in the end they are the ones that have to do it
2289400 last year this group won the area tournament but got beat by lamar in the championship of the district tournament
2289401 this is a good district and anyone that gets out of this district will be in it for a while these kids right here have been in our little league program since they were 6 or 7 weve had some good teams but theyve come on like gangbusters

2289403 people always make allegations in lawsuits its purely a commercial dispute
2289404 im going to talk to other teams in the nascar paddock
2289405 im going to talk to everybody and see what my options are for next year as well as talking to teams and manufacturers in other series
2289406 we havent spoken specifically about the fourth car yet but thats a subject im definitely going to talk to him about
2289407 its not a good feeling its the first time its happened in my career its just a sign of the times really right now
2289408 ive used the time to have some fun and enjoy the summer back in scotland which is something i havent been able to do for a while im happy to be back at the glen
2289409 i thought about saying ok ill do something else but i really didnt want it to end that way
2289410 i figure i might as well be in the car somewhere the fastenal guys have done a good job this year we really havent managed to show what we can do
2289411 id like to do more races but the deal was always that bryan clauson and i would share so i dont think its fair now that my circumstances have changed that he should suddenly give up the ride i think theyre doing the fair thing
2289412 im glad to put an end to all the rumors and speculation and solidify my position at dei
2289413 a lot of it has been a distraction its been hard dealing with all the rumors a lot of people are critical of dei for the wrong reasons that i dont think are fair to the people who put their heart and soul into company were getting stronger as a company and a race team
2289414 missed deadlines heath ledgers death questionable quality and poor sales projections
2289415 tim s the luckiest husband i know you finally get a job and it s 3 000 miles away
2289416 the last time we were leading at sonoma well it mustve been 300 feet before i drove off the track
2289417 hopefully i get that opportunity to lead again but not drive off the race track
2289418 thats what were planning to do this weekend track position is really important weve got the same car and feel like were going to run good i like this track and im looking forward to it
2289419 were going to be as competitive and going from where we did back to 11th was competitive so i feel good about a top five run here certainly weve got the opportunity
2289420 i do a little bit better this race track than i do at sonoma probably because it has more flatter and slower speed corners which cater to road course drivers a little bit better than my method of jerking on the wheel and brakes and gas
2289421 i tend to like this race track ive had a little more success here
2289422 biffle going for wins in effort to secure chase berth
2289423 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2289424 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2289425 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereignty has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible

2289427 they india have very good batting line up actually one of the greatest batsmen is sachin tendulkar it was really big moment for me when i got that wicket i am really happy
2289428 in form man sehwag has batted really well i was a bit nervous at that time opening spell but when i got that wicket i gained confidence and that is why i got three wickets
2289429 i really enjoyed bowling at this wicket actually i got confidence and that is very important thing
2289430 faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable
2289431 an indian who has no money and no child he doesnt own a house and also worried that his mother is blind
2289432 oh cause you say youre gettin ready for the weekend like youre headed home or something
2289433 hey yeah thats cool i see you got your ring
2289434 you know thats gotta be some good man youve got there
2289435 thats not for me though you know i cant be tied down
2289436 if you feel that you can holla at your boy any time you feel me
2289437 thanks but i gotta be honest with you i dont think thats ever gonna happen
2289438 thats cool thats cool i feel that you have a good weekend you feel me
2289439 joel and daniel annas gm husband dont know how to scuba dive
2289440 the plan has always been to get him in some races at the end of the year to see if he could potentially run the full schedule next year
2289441 putting him in the race car i know from outside the sport it looks a little bit interesting to say the least but its kind of been on our radar since last august ideally it was gonna be a second car and to be very frank we just havent performed to the level we expected to and it makes that kind of growth not only hard but risky were gonna try and scale back here the rest of the season and get focused with him behind the wheel of the car
2289442 some of those guys that performed pretty well in cup cars we kind of looked at all those
2289443 but for us it was a pretty easy decision given where we are with this race team its still really young and were still looking forward we felt like with brad and our association with joe gibbs racing and his history there it was a really good fit
2289444 he is approved for everything outside the restrictor plate races
2289445 obviously he sat on the pole at talladega last year in a jgr car and so we fully expect him to be cleared but we wanted to get a couple of races under our belt and brett said that shouldnt be a problem
2289446 to qualify for every race i do if we can do that i think itd be a good rest of the year i wanna try and get this team back in the top 35 in points the team is currently 196 points shy of the no 35 position im sure ill be a little nervous before the race at michigan in the nationwide series i earned all the respect of the cup guys i gotta go back out there in the cup series and gain the respect at that level which is what my main goal is
2289447 i dont have a single bad thing to say about j j hes a great guy to be around he really genuinely cared about what we were doing and he never ever gave us an issue in the car at all he always gave us 100 percent sometimes these situations just dont work out
2289448 the last time that i went out with ampatapuh he said he didnt want to waste his money tipping a waiter 20 percent because he wasnt sure that the restaurant business was going to pan out
2289449 all i can say is everything is about to change
2289450 this strike is about more than just us hopefully it will end soon and ill be able to secure a job that will keep our benefits going until then ill get out on the picket line and do my duty
2289451 what is it about making dresses out of denim that makes designers start bawling in front of the judges not that it takes a lot to set ricky off but still that guy makes andrae look like nina
2289452 ill just staple some inside out denim to the bottom of a jean jacket and call it a coat
2289453 ill take a ton of ideas that i dont have time to implement throw them all against the wall that is this coat and see what sticks
2289454 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
2289455 the investigators looked around they decided they had to find somebody they went after all of them but he looked the most susceptible to pressure
2289456 it is like prisoners of war if they are harassed enough they will be driven to do anything but i dont believe he would have done what they say he did
2289457 science is a wonderful thing but it is at the end of the day a tool
2289458 there was always the lingering question as to whether you would ever really be able to find differences that would be useful in terms of doing attribution
2289459 finding that you could really apply many of the same parallels with human forensics to microbial forensics
2289460 my recommendation would clearly be to not wait until something happens again because it may not be with anthrax
2289461 theyve got a heavy lift to convince the scientific world theyve nailed it

2289483 one of the reasons that meats brown is the conversion of the fat to ages

2289486 but supposedly i dont believe it but lets accept it for this arguments sake sunlight causes melanoma
2289487 in a study appearing in the january issue of the journal of clinical investigation takashi kadowaki and colleagues from the university of tokyo japan show that in mice with high fat diet induced insulin resistance changes in glucose concentration are likely to be the main trigger of increased beta cell mass
2289488 high fat diets do induce insulin resistance in mice because mice dont normally eat a high fat diet but mice arent humans and the same diet doesnt make humans insulin resistant
2289489 so i seriously doubt that complex molecules such as ages could be absorbed in there native state
2289490 i m not particularly worried about the ages i eat i much more worried about the ages i create within

2289501 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2289502 iranss decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
2289503 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2289504 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
2289505 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the u s and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
2289506 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2289507 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash programme
2289508 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year

2289747 global food shortages have placed the middle east and north africa in a quandary as they are forced to choose between growing more crops to feed an expanding population or preserving their already scant supply of water for decades nations in this region have drained aquifers sucked the salt from seawater and diverted the mighty nile to make the deserts bloom but those projects were so costly and used so much water that it remained far more practical to import food than to produce it today some countries import 90 percent or more of their staples now the worldwide food crisis is making many countries in this politically volatile region rethink that math the population of the region has more than quadrupled since 1950 to 364 million and is expected to reach nearly 600 million by 2050 by that time the amount of fresh water available for each person already scarce will be cut in half and declining resources could inflame political tensions further

2289756 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2289757 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had

2289761 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2289762 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2289763 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2289764 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes

2289910 yes weve been asked and the bishops of this church responded in ways that would provide bursaries for those unable to attend
2289911 i believe the archbishop of canterbury has expressed a desire to come to the united states and do some fundraising work and we have certainly offered our assistance in that
2289912 the archbishops council of the church of england met on august 7th to discuss an approach from the lambeth company for financial help
2289913 the company has assured the council that it is continuing to make further approaches throughout the anglican communion to meet the full cost of this years conference
2289914 it cannot however be confident that these will generate funds sufficiently quickly for it to meet all of its obligations as they fall due over the coming weeks and months
2289915 the archbishops council has therefore agreed to make available to the company up to 600k from its reserve funds as required to enable the company to honour its commitments while fundraising efforts continue at this stage the council regards this as an interest free loan facility
2289916 bishops were notified of the current financial position during the conference and the possibility raised with them that there might have to be further approaches for assistance with the costs of the conference at this stage the shortfall in funding is unclear as bills come in to be settled but it is likely to be approaching 1 million
2289917 the shortfall is being addressed as agreed by the continuing fund raising programme and we are grateful for the assistance of the archbishops council of the church of england in supporting the cash flow of the conference company as the fundraising continues around the communion

2289922 with 35 safety and security features our all new dodge ram is designed to protect and perform
2289923 online society within a 3d world where users can explore build socialize and participate in their own economy
2289924 almost my only client cuz they keep me so busy and i dont want to tick them off
2289925 many maybe most contractors dont own the code they are hired to write it for a company that then owns the generated artifacts
2289926 do you have a library of code that you have built up over the years that you use over and over how have you handled licensing it with other
2289927 in general as a contractor you never want to be transferring the copyright you want to license it let them have full resale rights if they like but absolute ownership is much more expensive to buy than licensing
2289928 its been discussed here and elsewhere why it is a bad reason to only have one client they have you over a barrel head
2289929 the difficult part with the whole give them total rights thing is coming up with an amount for that
2289930 in difficult periods like this it is vital that we continue to evolve our products to exceed customers needs and jeep patriot does just that
2289931 by providing great fuel economy performance handling and flexibility all at an affordable price the jeep patriot is a tremendous value
2289932 even though gas prices are high some consumers are still in search of a sport utility vehicle to meet their needs
2289933 for those consumers vehicles like the jeep patriot are relative bargains in their segment
2289934 the locker room is the best one i have ever been in and i love this city its just that i feel i am in a bit of a land
2289935 he is just more conservative than ballouchy and we have to attack at home tomorrow
2289936 during those wedding vows yeah that part didnt really apply to him but not to worry cause john john claims the affair didnt start until elizabeths cancer was in remission
2289937 we did apologise and were genuinely sorry if we upset anyone
2289938 but we never put anyones life in danger or did any of the things that have been reported were just two girls who went away for a week and had a few drinks on a plane
2289939 lynette was playing music on her mobile for about two minutes and the woman next to her asked her to turn it off which she did
2289940 wed bought a bottle of vodka and were just having a drink and chatting
2289941 lynette sprayed some perfume and the woman said it was giving her kids a headache
2289942 then a steward came and asked for the vodka wed paid for it and he was obnoxious so we said no
2289943 later another steward came and asked us nicely for it so we handed it over but the next thing we know someone is saying weve been diverted to frankfurt and we were going to be chucked off
2289944 i got up to find out what was going on because i knew my kids would be at the airport waiting for me with my boyfriend and i was worried but they wouldnt listen
2289945 but i never went near a door i wouldnt put my own life at risk let alone anyone elses
2289946 weve been made out to be this pair of slappers who went away for a boozy week and caused a load of trouble but thats just not us ive got to go in work and im dreading it
2289947 my kids think im famous but its been awful i just wish it was all over
2289948 i am delighted with all of our athletes to come away from the national age group and youth championships with three new national champions and 12 medals is outstanding
2289949 the people of salford should feel very proud that our city has produced six national champions in the past three years in james doolan luke wood heather frederiksen amanda nugent daniel phillips and elliot hynes
2289950 this demonstrates the strength of the salford community leisure training scheme and how positively it can impact on the lives of young people in salford
2289951 the city has some fantastic young athletes who have worked incredibly hard to bring recognition to the city of salford
2289952 i had a good look around but there was nothing going it was frustrating but i am satisfied that we havent missed out on anyone
2289953 we ended our seven game losing streak against hunslet at the weekend we were desperate for that win and i have to praise the players for the way they responded to adversity
2289954 the lads never gave up and kept working while they were losing
2289955 i am confident of us kicking on now but i can see the rochdale game being very close and the fact is that our play off chances are out of our hands
2289956 they are completely in the hands of workington who are four points ahead of us in eighth spot
2289957 we have 15 players signed up for next season and stephen nash has now agreed to stay i have sent his one year contract out to his agent for him to sign
2289958 we are delighted that stephen is staying hes a good player with a lot of potential hes only 22 and front rowers generally arent at their best until they are in their late 20s
2289959 i have also spoken to the agents of stephen bannister and luke adamson signing them is our top priority now in terms of keeping players from this years squad
2289960 i am confident that they will both stay and i expect to hear back from them in the next few days
2289961 bannister has been in really good form for us lately and i am sure that he will rise to the challenge of returning to super league having played in the top flight for st helens and harlequins
2289962 adamson has been with us for a long time and is another very good young player
2289963 we have got to keep our best young players and continue to produce others
2289964 we are looking to sign a half back and todd carney is a great player but i have not been in contact with the player or his agent
2289965 he is on good money in australia and i dont know if we could afford him but if we could afford him and canberra were happy for him to go then we would be interested yes
2289966 we are talking to a few players about signing for us but we are not after sculthorpe cooke or faumuina they are all good players but they are not players that we have spoken about so they wont be coming to salford
2289967 we are very confident of winning but we cant afford to be complacent
2289968 dewsbury are a decent side on their day and they beat whitehaven at the weekend who were the form team in the competition before that result
2289969 i have broken two personal bests on the flying 200 metres and personal bests do wonders for your morale to be at the top of my form just days before beijing is a wonderful feeling
2289970 the quality of every single effort i put in on the track now is vital you have to be hitting the right numbers every lap there is simply no room for cruising
2289971 everything weve achieved in the last four years the personal bests and the world championship gold medals now feels like a stepping stone to this moment this is the top of the mountain for us and if were as strong in beijing as we should be it will take an outstanding performance to beat us
2289972 my aims and ambitions are to fulfil my potential so i can leave beijing feeling satisfied
2289973 but i dont put the same pressure on myself as i used to i know i am capable of winning whatever colour medal i want
2289974 it seems to us the council took advantage of stealth tactics and delivered the letters at the weekend possibly thinking they would catch us unawares
2289975 well they were very wrong we cared about these trees in 2001 when we prevented the council from cutting them down and we still care about them
2289976 after we won the battle seven years ago residents commissioned an independent survey which identified a total of 16 trees that may need to be felled or pruned at some time in the future not the number the council have highlighted
2289977 we appreciate some residents have strong feelings about the trees but the issue remains that a number are unsafe and need to come down
2289978 the pavements are heavily used particularly by children on their way to the local primary school and we have a duty to make them as safe as possible
2289979 though we have held a number of meetings with residents over the past few years we recognise on reflection that we should have made them aware earlier that work was about to start
2289980 we apologise for this and are happy to discuss with residents any concerns they may have
2289981 as a principle we always look to replace every tree that we remove but that is unfortunately not an option along pine grove
2289982 the volume of utility cables and pipes means that new trees cannot be planted in the same locations and narrow streets prevent us from indenting them into the road itself
2289983 i went into the house with partner darren hartley both of us wearing breathing apparatus
2289984 even though some of the doors were closed we could see the flames licking round the edges it was like being in a furnace
2289985 firefighters from bolton station managed to locate the grandmothers body and we helped them take her out we then went back in and found the younger woman and got her out this is the worst incident i have ever experienced and the death of the little girl is a total tragedy
2289986 i saw this person head to toe in flames and didnt even realise who it was
2289987 we managed to get him to an ambulance where paramedics immediately leapt into action all steves clothes had been burnt off
2289988 i have worked at many stations and been involved in a lot of rescues but this was horrendous
2289989 the fact that a colleague was seriously injured has devastated everyone and the knowledge that the little girl has now died brings it all back chris and i are not trying to make out we are heroes the only reason why we have spoken up is because this incident happened over a month ago and we want to jog peoples memories
2289990 we still believe there are people out there who are talking to each other about what happened but not talking to us
2289991 it is really worrying that our biggest hospital has so many problems
2289992 labour have said for years that they want to clean up our hospitals and i think they have had ample chance to do that
2289993 what they need to do now is act on these promises and sort out salford royal
2289994 i am shocked by these figures and am absolutely amazed by the levels of infestations i had thought that the hospital had been doing really well in the fight against mrsa and c difficile and i will be trying to find out more about what we are doing to combat this
2289995 salford royal takes a proactive stance to dealing with pest control it has an established contract based on preventative and reactive measures
2289996 out of the 240 occasions when the pest control team visited the trust during the 27 months in question 100 of these visits were for proactive preventative measures the remaining 140 call outs were to deal with pest sitings
2289997 salford royal is a large and busy site which currently is undergoing a 200m redevelopment the trust wishes to reassure the public that it takes the matter of pest control very seriously and encourages its staff to report pest sitings this combined with its proactive contract means that any pest problems can be dealt with immediately
2289998 after my experience the only way id go anywhere near the emergency department is if they carried me off in an ambulance
2289999 im not at all surprised by these figures but they are still absolutely horrendous nobody wants these infestations in a hospital
