7260040 barack is quite good at shaking hands making fundamentally meaningless speaches sound important and having a big set of pearly white teeth
7260041 however we felt that scotty added that little something to the team in terms of the ability to sound like a complete d1ck at the poker table while drinking 12 bottles of phil helmuth branded beer and somehow still win

7260053 they countered our game plan by making some incredible plays every possession counted if it wasnt for our determination we wouldnt have pulled it through

7260055 we played well we almost had it we fought to the end we had a chance
7260056 that probably goes down as one of the greatest games in olympic history

7260171 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of world
7260172 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7260173 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7260174 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7260175 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7260176 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behaviour in any meaningful way
7260177 the making of the rose parade hgtv weller grossman productions
7260178 we have been shattered by this people were crying last sunday realising that we will no longer be able to come here
7260179 i have a very special memory that happened at this church
7260180 it would be such a shame if you do close the church
7260181 this area is crying out to be supported but we feel that he has treated us like peasants rather than listening to what we have to say
7260182 he has been grossly negligent in regard to running this parish
7260183 has failed to act in the interests of the charity and its beneficiaries the parishioners and clergy
7260184 closing these churches is the last thing that the bishop wants to do but he had no choice
7260185 we have had a consultation the case was put to them and thats it congregations of 200 arent viable any more

7260192 the truth is that this poor widow gave more to the collection than all the others put together all the others gave what theyll never miss she gave extravagantly what she couldnt afford she gave her all
7260193 some men came down from judea and began teaching the brethren
7260194 it is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the law of moses
7260195 brethren you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that by my mouth the gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe
7260196 now therefore why do you put god to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear
7260197 but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the lord jesus in the same way as they also are
7260198 you foolish galatians who has bewitched you before whose eyes jesus christ was publicly portrayed as crucified
7260199 all i saw was flashing eyes and teeth and i knew i was gonna have to kill him if i could
7260200 i told myself i would never compete past the age of 30
7260201 im not sure if ill go a few more years after the london olympics i dont know why i picked 30 but i told coach bob bowman that im not swimming past the age of 30 so dont get any ideas
7260202 he said well thats good because i dont want to coach you past the age of 30
7260203 its going to be no breastroke no distance swimming and no open water so at least those guys will still be my friends
7260204 ive no idea what i am really going to do over the next four years but im looking forward to trying some new events and swimming some events that i havent really had the opportunity to swim
7260205 bob said to me that hes going to put everything that hes done coaching me and just throw it out the door and do something completely different just to see how it works
7260206 if its successful then great if not we can go back to what weve been doing
7260207 weve all had some races here and there and they britain have improved so much over the last four years and im just looking forward to seeing how much faster they can go
7260208 im having fun and i think thats really all that matters
7260209 you can do anything i think one of the biggest things ive learned over the last four years is that anything is possible if you set your imagination
7260210 whatever you dream of you can do for me the skys the limit i have some pretty lofty dreams in my head and those goals are going to stay there until they are accomplished
7260211 the icc board today agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy until october 2009
7260212 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7260213 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7260214 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7260215 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7260216 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7260217 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7260218 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7260219 obviously this is the best of times and the worst of times
7260220 im going to be able to delve into both of those emotions
7260221 we need to get home and get on with that now
7260222 coming here four years ago he instilled a sense of belief in our team that we could come back at that time i think we were eighth in the world four years ago when he came in we didnt win a lot of tournaments it took a couple years until we started to win some big events
7260223 this match is a culmination of a vision and dream that hugh gave to our team four years ago
7260224 it seems so very far away but he talked about it with great conviction his ability to say we need to believe it before it will happen and then that we will need to do the work he impressed that upon us
7260225 i was talking to ryan millar walking into the village after we beat in the semifinals and i remembered that i had said to myself after the disappointing loss against russia in 2004 that maybe this wasnt the time maybe it was worth it to put in four more years maybe the next one was ours
7260226 maybe that was more than intuition maybe that was just a voice telling me to keep with this
7260227 im really sorry about what happened with your family i think it is more important than matches it is more important life and family
7260228 if i spend time getting angry thats not going to help you heal or help me support my wife or my family my job is to try to be there for them and to help everyone get through the grieving process
7260229 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7260230 bob said to me that hes going to take everything hes done coaching me and throw it out the door and try something completely different just to see how it works
7260231 well try a bunch of new things if were successful great if not we can go back to what weve been doing
7260232 isnt that interesting or i wonder why i just reacted that way
7260233 and it took quite a few years to realize that i wasnt having any fun at all and i was like stuck i was stuck
7260234 and then i realized im not really addicted to crack im not addicted to weed im addicted to not being straight
7260235 oh my god i dont have to live like that ever again i really dont i was like wow i can be clean
7260236 this is the happiest ive ever been in my life since i was a kid because i forgot how to be happy
7260237 at one point tania told the inmates that she is the heaviest she has ever been but it wasnt a lament her point was that shes comfortable with herself
7260238 for me the hardest part was dealing with feelings and guilt
7260239 its a real story this really happens and just because somebody relapses doesnt mean that its over
7260240 the world is out full of all kinds of things that make you angry every single day every single morning driving to work is annoying
7260241 some sort of reflection some sort of plan so that this doesnt happen again
7260242 if a negative situation may arise in the future i will promptly take care of it in a mature assertive nature
7260243 she had the same feelings feeling alone and rejected and she used drugs to hide from her problems
7260244 people to often view drug addicts as less than human
7260245 god has made tania who she is to inspire other people
7260246 but even tanias biggest supporters say tanias continued success is not a given brown said tania needs to go to college get a good job and feel she is bettering the world
7260247 the thing with tania is shell go a long extended period doing fine and all of a sudden she relapses so she needs to keep progressing
7260248 one or two parents have made it all the way through the drug court program and then on graduation day with the cake waiting tested positive for drugs
7260249 it took a lot of courage to have your story become public and i think youve been an inspiration for many people
7260250 i will never give up on a case because of you i will never give up on somebody because of you you gave me a run for my money girl but you proved what i said a year ago it takes brass ovaries to do this
7260251 welcome back to life tania im so glad to see you again
7260252 some girls are anorexic others turn to alcohol and drugs i chose sex
7260253 its not a nice thing to do people wouldnt understand
7260254 i had a guy from a national newspaper track me down and say have you got any comment to make all of your new album has come up on the internet and i was going its impossible its ludicrous because only four or five people had copies so i said read out the song titles that are up on the internet and he read out the track listing from the last album so i was like thats on the internet is it its also in hmv in the o section you idiot
7260255 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into lars ulrich mode about this
7260256 its well documented i dont even have a computer and i dont get involved in that type of gear
7260257 if people are willing to have faceless cds like that in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money to pay for an album so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law
7260258 pinch as many kaiser chiefs as you like and the pigeon detectives but dont nick any oasis
7260259 keep the evian water topped up in my swimming pool
7260260 het weer is erg meegevallen en het is helemaal niet warm

7260275 the abortion supervisory committee is blatantly ignoring a high court judgment that put the committee on notice for failing to fulfil its statutory duties
7260276 the ease with which women can obtain an abortion in new zealand can be compared to the ease of a mass murderer eg an al qaeda terrorist crossing a us border control with only one out of 100 border control operators awake on the job at their individual check points in fact its easier because all three of the abortion supervisory committee members who have a statutory duty to oversee the border control ensure that certifying consultants are complying with the law etc are strongly in favour like fitzpatrick of making the mas murder of babies more accessible one is even a practising baby killer abortionist herself

7260283 if its good and its not going to make me sick i guess i dont really care all that much
7260284 if i really suspect something i would ask where it came from what the name is if they have proof but that would only be if i strongly suspected something and thats never happened

7260353 there were at times behind closed doors and even at practice when we were trying to develop a game that hugh and the staff believed that would some day turn us into olympic champions
7260354 and obviously this is the culmination of it but its all the days behind closed doors and all the work you really put in that no one else besides the team and staff
7260355 they deserved the victory im glad a great group of people won the gold medal so great persons and great professionals so i think the gold is in good hands we fought we tried hard they were better they deserved it and we must learn from those who beat us and try to be stronger the next time
7260356 on one hand i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly and my heart aches for my wife and for our family for the loss
7260357 and on the other hand of course i am extremely proud and happy for my team and for usa volleyball as an organization and for the thing that weve been able to achieve

7260361 there are just too many veterans that need help and its unacceptable to me
7260362 when i go home i still cant believe it it looks like a place on cape cod its beautiful quiet serene
7260363 im here to help because they did so much for me
7260364 theres no more important meaningful and purposeful work than serving our veterans

7260368 someone saw what happened or saw her and didnt want to be involved
7260369 we think kids bounce back they dont bounce back if theyre broken
7260370 youd hear her moan and groan and cry out she was fighting the demons
7260371 when she came around i thought i got a little competition out here
7260372 its always been an issue but its never been out of hand
7260373 theyve burned all their bridges they have a whole life of havoc and hurt behind them
7260374 we was as close as people can be in the life of addiction

7260377 repeating a pattern of responding with hostility and failing to reflect on the probable consequences he is caught in a vicious circle of his own actions and the negative reactions of others
7260378 hostile excitable subject to tantrums and interpersonally disruptive he explodes into uncontrollable rages if provoked unleashing thoughtless abuse and verbal contempt on those near him
7260379 the whole time robert was placed at piney ridge he made no progress
7260380 robbies personality is typified by unpredictable and pessimistic moods an edgy irritability a tendency to engage in obstructive behavior and the feeling of being misunderstood and unappreciated
7260381 he shifts from periods of anxious futility to self deprecation and despair both characterized by a demanding irritability and bitter discontent
7260382 we already talked about all this stuff for six sessions when i was at piney ridge get over it
7260383 robert has so many issues that he may never be ready to return home
7260384 the stepmother also has a lot of issues she is dealing with and may never be ready to have robert return home either
7260385 saying all those hurtful things to you when i was mad
7260386 no matter how well robert does in his treatment if he messes up even a little bit candace jumps all over it and says see he has not changed a bit
7260387 robert states that he is frustrated because there is no movement toward going home
7260388 robbie has the potential to do so many great things with his life
7260389 other people seem to take the wrong meaning from what ive said
7260390 even if i get sober stay straight i doubt that my family will ever really trust me again
7260391 which of these problems are you willing to work on while in treatment in this program
7260392 something might occur to prevent him from having to go again
7260393 the situation always seems to go back to the family being in constant conflict
7260394 he wasnt taking his medicine and hes left to his own devices since he hasnt been in school
7260395 hated the idea of having to get up at certain times
7260396 he is not ready to change and it will do no good to force him to change

7260404 las mismas normas para todos no vale que para unos s y para otros no
7260405 there are always handfuls of guys who were born to hit and want to hit but i like to watch their intensity on defense and what they do when they get on the bases
7260406 vottos splits of hitting right and left are better right now than bruces but that takes time our brad hawpe was not good and this year he has having a breakthrough year against left handed pitchers
7260407 i notice both votto and bruce are aggressive hitters look to be confident hitters and seem to enjoy what they are doing
7260408 they both have age on their side and skills thats a great combination to have
7260409 he is one guy nobody has talked about hes a crafty lefty and is 14 5 this year
7260410 he won 15 last year actually 16 at class aaa nashville tenn and class aa huntsville ala i dont buy that about guys not having enough fastball its if they know how to win
7260411 you know todd frazier class a sarasota fla shortstop played on the toms river n j team that won the little league world series 1998
7260412 he has 12 homers but im thinking he might be too big 6 foot 3 215 pounds to play shortstop
7260413 but then i see colorado shortstop troy tulowitzki 6 3 205 and man that whole colorado infield is big
7260414 im trying to keep volquez close to the cy even though its an outside shot
7260415 i want him to keep that cy in sight he says its no big deal but its a big deal for me because it would be a big deal for him
7260416 bako has been doing a good job with the kids and especially the way those kids have been throwing to him
7260417 and cueto has been throwing outstanding too with bako so bako will get tonight and tomorrow with cueto and well give the kid rookie ryan hanigan a couple in houston
7260418 oh yeah he gives a good target he is in the ballgame he calls a real good game and he studies you know
7260419 whoever our catcher is especially if it is hanigan bako would be like chicagos henry blanco hes made all the difference in the world helping rookie geovany soto thats down the line so well get that when we get there
7260420 i dont get mad they dont want to give up runs
7260421 lincoln needed to get a double play but couldnt and neither could masset he got it up too you cant mess with matt holliday with the bases loaded weve escaped it a couple of times but sooner or later he is gonna get you
7260422 these guys can hit and theyre dangerous in this ballpark
7260423 you try to stay away from the big inning but thats what got us in the eighth four runs
7260424 its tough to throw 40 pitches in the second inning thats a lot and you know that is going to come back to get you
7260425 and he has seen many thanks to me and my obsession

7260439 bisa saja caleg nomor urut di bawah caleg perempuan yang ketokohannya tak diragukan lagi dan memang dikenal luas masyarakat justru memproleh suara terbanyak sesuai keputusan partai dialah yang duduk nantinya
7260440 kalau tidak dapil dapat kursi artinya ada delapan kursi itu target minimal tapi kita usahakan lebih dari itu

7260463 many african negotiators have expressed concern that the current regime delivers few real benefits to the continent
7260464 the total value of projects in africa financed by the global environment facility in the last 17 years stands at 378m while the total value of projects worldwide is more than 2 4bn which reflects lack of benefits for the continent
7260465 the way african countries feel is that we need a fairer more equitable deal that is sensitive to the looming consequences of climate change on africa
7260466 only about two percent of the entire cdm projects worldwide are in africa which is unacceptably low in contrast to 45 percent located in china 16 percent in india and 13 percent in chile
7260467 it is true the cdm benefits the great emerging economies of china and india among others more than africa because of their fast rate of development and stable conditions for investment

7260487 yo ten a ocho a os cuando ocurri mi madre y yo hab amos salido para visitar a una amiga y baj bamos por el camino de detr s de la casa cerca del cementerio
7260488 no era muy tarde pero como era invierno ya era de noche fue justo al llegar al cruce yo o un ruido de pasos muy grande como si se acercase mucha gente le pregunt a mam si lo o a y dijo que s entonces vimos que bajaba por la carretera una procesi n como de un entierro eran muchos no s el n mero pero todos vest an igual llevaban una especie de t nicas negras que les cubr an todo el cuerpo con una capucha tambi n negra pasaron muy cerca de nosotras
7260489 nos quedamos paralizadas yo era muy peque a y no entend a muy bien qu era aquello pero mi madre estaba aterrorizada me apretaba muy fuerte contra ella dici ndome que no hiciera ruido y cual fue nuestra sorpresa que al final de la fila de la compa a vimos a una mujer a una vecina nuestra
7260490 era la t a preciosa una vecina que viv a unas casas m s arriba de la nuestra yo la reconoc por su forma de andar porque ten a un defecto en las piernas y luego la vimos muy claramente llevaba como un palo en la mano y una especie de pedra como un m rmol pero muy muy brillante pas a nuestro lado en silencio como un nima y se fue detr s de la santa compa a

7260509 er is geen protectionistische backlash in europa en er is ook geen gevaar voor
7260510 zelfs in de lidstaten waar de retoriek protectionistisch is is het daadwerkelijke beleid dat niet
7260511 je kunt de filippijnse regering moeilijk verdenken van linkse sympathie n maar ook de filippijnse ministers stonden te juichen dat er geen akkoord kwam
7260512 jullie hebben een bijna socialistische landbouw wij in de derde wereld zijn niet zo vrijgevig onze boeren moeten zien te overleven op de markt
7260513 dat lijkt me geen goed idee dat ik amerika en europa verwijt een dubbele agenda te voeren betekent niet dat ik voor vrijhandel ben ontwikkelingslanden moeten primair kiezen voor ontwikkeling handelsverdragen moeten daaraan ondergeschikt worden gemaakt nu is het andersom ontwikkeling wordt ondergeschikt gemaakt aan vrijhandel ontwikkelingslanden worden gedwongen om hun grenzen open te stellen voor producten uit het noorden het gevolg is dat de lokale productie wordt vernietigd vrijhandel is zo een codenaam voor de winstdoelstelling van multinationale ondernemingen en niet alleen ontwikkeling maar ook het milieu wordt ondergeschikt gemaakt aan vrijhandel
7260514 de zuid oost aziatische landen hebben hun exporten de laatste jaren enorm opgevoerd maar ik geloof niet dat die voordelen het gevolg zijn van de liberalisering die de wereldhandelsorganisatie wto heeft doorgevoerd zij konden ook v r de wto hun producten kwijt op terreinen waar de wto voordelen beloofde is daar weinig van terecht gekomen quotas voor producten zijn vervangen door hogere invoertarieven de muren voor agrarische producten zijn onverminderd hoog en op het succes van de exportindustrie n in azi is ook wel wat af te dingen het is vaak gepaard gegaan met een aanslag op het milieu bovendien is het de vraag of zon exportgerichte strategie op langere termijn succes heeft er is namelijk sprake van een wereldwijde overproductie dit leidt tussen de aziatische landen tot een concurrentieslag om de laagste lonen en de grootste belastingvoordelen op dit moment concurreert china alle andere landen in de regio eruit
7260515 vergeet niet dat china en vietnam feitelijk nog staatseconomie n zijn de fabrikanten daar worden gesteund door belastingvrijstelling en ook op andere manieren bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van huisvesting daar is sprake van staatssteun
7260516 dat is een principieel standpunt wij zijn een mondiale fietsenfabrikant en we zijn in alle omstandigheden voor vrijhandel
7260517 als de importheffingen volledig zouden worden afgeschaft is er voor giant geen enkele reden om in europa te blijven
7260518 de investeringen die we in de fabriek doen hebben niks te maken met de antidumpingmaatregel het be nvloedt onze bedrijfsvoering niet
7260519 er gaat een uitgebreid onderzoek aan vooraf als de europese onderzoekers besluiten dat er gedumpt wordt dan is dat zo let wel het gaat hier niet om de lagere lonen die zijn een feit maar om de vervalsende steun
7260520 waarom niemand die het weet maar het is zeker geen principieel standpunt van de overheid anders had ze dat ook eerder kunnen laten weten
7260521 wij zijn in principe voor vrije eerlijke handel dat levert n lagere consumentenprijzen n een gevarieerder aanbod maar we zijn tegen dumping
7260522 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7260523 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7260524 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7260525 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7260526 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7260527 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio

7260529 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7260530 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7260531 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7260532 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7260533 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7260534 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7260535 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7260536 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7260537 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7260538 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7260539 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7260540 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7260541 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7260542 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7260543 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7260544 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7260545 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7260546 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7260547 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7260548 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7260549 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7260550 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7260551 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7260552 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7260553 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7260554 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7260555 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7260556 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7260557 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7260558 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7260559 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7260560 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7260561 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7260562 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7260563 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7260564 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7260565 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7260566 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7260567 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7260568 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7260569 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7260570 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7260571 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7260572 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7260573 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

7260575 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7260576 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7260577 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7260578 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7260579 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7260580 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7260581 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7260582 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7260583 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7260584 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7260585 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7260586 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7260587 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7260588 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7260589 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7260590 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7260591 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
7260592 geremi is a fantastic crosser of the ball as soon as he gets the ball i come alive
7260593 there are certain players who maybe look for through balls or look for this or for that
7260594 geremi is the type of player that likes getting it out of his feet and crossing it quickly and when players do that it is delightful for strikers
7260595 i try to get half a yard and spring and i did
7260596 he has had a few injuries but there is no doubting he is a top keeper we are blessed with two fantastic keepers here everyone knows that
7260597 that was even more pivotal than my goal he was fantastic and he is the hero
7260598 i dont know the answer to that all i know is my job is to put out a team that can win games and hopefully entertain
7260599 mamady nearly got killed less than a year ago and almost lost his life he still has the scars on his hands to show that and it obviously affected him
7260600 he was in a terrible state when he came back over to us after the game against togo and there were issues about whether he would even play for his county again but he has come over that
7260601 so i was pleased he scored mamady is a great player and works very hard and you bring him on with 20 minutes to go he can be a real handful and he was against villa
7260602 it is not just about goals with him its what he contributes around the team that gets him picked
7260603 he is such a big lad but such a lovely kid from a great family he is a real gem of a player
7260604 the first year in the premier league is all new and we hope that remains the case here that its new and fresh and everyone wants to enjoy it
7260605 i think we have some hunger and quality in the team and ricardo and liam were two who showed us that today
7260606 hopefully winning against villa will help us get maybe one or two other players to this squad we have got to develop as we go along
7260607 we know its going to be tough and up and down and have to make sure we stay as level as we can and not get too down when we lose or too elated when we win
7260608 it was a massive disappointment but we will bounce back from that result
7260609 on reflection on the whole game we should have taken something from it thats not to take anything away from stoke it was a great effort in front of their own crowd
7260610 we didnt play well in the first half but i thought that most of the second half belonged to us and we could never get our noses in front
7260611 we got the equaliser twice and just in the last minute or two whatever you do if you cant win the game make sure you dont lose it and unfortunately we contrived to do that
7260612 its really disappointing for all concerned its disappointing for the team and obviously for the supporters
7260613 but it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals
7260614 well come back again and i am still very positive because we only lost to a late goal
7260615 we are trying to get a few players in if its possible before the window closes
7260616 if we are going to cope with any sort of season ahead of us we would need to bring one or two more in
7260617 here is a true israelite there is no duplicity in him
7260618 rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel
7260619 do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree you will see greater things than this
7260620 like christ himself the apostles were unceasingly bent upon bearing witness to the truth of god they showed special courage in speaking the word of god with boldness acts 4 31 before the people and their rulers with a firm faith they held that the gospel is indeed the power of god unto salvation for all who believe they followed the example of the gentleness and respectfulness of christ
7260621 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
7260622 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7260623 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7260624 it was a little strange watching tv broadcast live pictures of the front of your house but thats part of it
7260625 one of the networks they were filming through the window of our house they were filming me in the kitchen making something to eat
7260626 i had given him my word that i would keep it in confidence so i did
7260627 he was very gracious in his call and said that he really appreciated getting to know me and held me in very high regard and wanted very much to work with me going forward both in the campaign and with his administration
7260628 its a bit like going through the political equivalent of a colonoscopy
7260629 they go over everything and anything and track down every crazy rumor and all sorts of stuff but the thing i would like to emphasize is it was an honor
7260630 what really matters is getting our country moving in a better direction
7260631 getting the economy turned around getting us out of iraq in a responsible way ending this dependency we have on imported oil which is so damaging look i like john mccain but i really think hes going to offer us more of the same and i think we need change
7260632 the people camped outside in the front of our house for the last three days i think that reminded everybody of the complete loss of any kind of normal life that you have once something like that happens but look they were up for it
7260633 ill be able to be a better dad and a better senator for the people of indiana and both of those things mean a lot to me
7260634 keep them for the scrap book even though they turned out to be a big head fake
7260635 and i wasnt entirely sure which speech i would be giving
7260636 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7260637 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7260638 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7260639 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7260640 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7260641 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7260642 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7260643 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7260644 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7260645 we did our best but the best was not enough
7260646 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7260647 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7260648 we need to get home and get on with that now
7260649 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7260650 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7260651 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7260652 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7260653 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7260654 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7260655 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7260656 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7260657 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7260658 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7260659 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7260660 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7260661 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7260662 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7260663 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7260664 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7260665 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7260666 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7260667 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7260668 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7260669 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7260670 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7260671 hasil ini sangatlah baik dan mengejutkan karena saya pertama kali tampil di makassar dan langsung menjadi juara
7260672 sirkuit di sini sangat baik tapi rasanya panasnya ini bisa membunuh semua orang cara menyiasatinya adalah saya tidak makan banyak dan tidak seperti orang orang yang memakai cool shir t karena saya ingin tubuh bisa beradaptasi dengan hawa panas
7260673 saya juga sangat terbantu dengan navigator yang sangat berpengalaman yang sempat menemani kramjit singh berlomba di indonesia
7260674 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7260675 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7260676 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7260677 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7260678 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7260679 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7260680 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7260681 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7260682 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7260683 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7260684 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7260685 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7260686 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7260687 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7260688 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7260689 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7260690 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7260691 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7260692 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7260693 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7260694 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7260695 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7260696 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7260697 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7260698 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7260699 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it
7260700 i like my spotter hes a good guy but man this is ridiculous
7260701 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear clear and went up and there was someone still there we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves
7260702 we had a good racecar and its a shame we got caught up in that mess
7260703 i just saw cars wrecking in front of me and there was nothing i could do
7260704 flood devastates community hundreds feared dead and thousands without homes
7260705 the darfur region is estimated to have 1 000 000 causalities in the next 2 years
7260706 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7260707 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7260708 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7260709 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7260710 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7260711 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7260712 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7260713 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7260714 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7260715 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7260716 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7260717 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7260718 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7260719 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7260720 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7260721 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7260722 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7260723 bei ger chten dieser art sollte man vor allem in zeiten des wahlkampfs vorsichtig sein
7260724 meinen informationen zufolge stammt diese geschichte aus missethons m rchenstunde und dem vp scharfmacher sei gesagt es reicht herr missethon
7260725 wenn die vp angesichts der steigenden umfragewerte der sp nerv s wird kann ich das verstehen doch missethons m rchenstunde wird h chstens ausreichen um die eigenen funktion rinnen einzulullen die wienerinnen und wiener hingegen wissen dass ihre stadt gut verwaltet wird und das wird auch in zukunft so bleiben

7260727 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7260728 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7260729 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7260730 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7260731 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7260732 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7260733 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7260734 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7260735 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7260736 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7260737 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7260738 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7260739 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7260740 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7260741 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7260742 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7260743 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7260744 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7260745 es gibt viel luft nach oben das in diesem jahr besser zu machen
7260746 es besteht die gefahr dass er wieder nicht zum einsatz kommt

7260754 players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best
7260755 ive been a player and ive been away with england many times and it is hard to get going again
7260756 i had about an hour with my players yesterday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands
7260757 it was an exciting game to be fair and were always trying to win it and make it exciting for people
7260758 but sometimes and ive said this to the lads when youre tired and you know youre tired its important you have a bank of four and another bank of four and be hard to beat
7260759 i understand the team need a starting centre ready for next season
7260760 i am not only making this decision for me and my family but also for the team
7260761 i have really enjoyed my time here and i will miss the rhinos very much but suffering another knee injury has been a massive disappointment
7260762 hopefully i can pick up a club when i am back to full fitness in late spring next year but i am mentally strong and up for the challenge
7260763 obviously we wanted to win and weve only taken a point but with ten men it was totally deserved
7260764 och mitt hj rta tillh r inte dig det har det aldrig gjort
7260765 people expect regardless of whether were smaller or not theyll expect us to do something profoundly positive as well and leave our mark
7260766 there are a lot of pieces that need to pulled together still before we can get to a seamless operation of the games
7260767 of course they are all in play but theres still lots of work to do
7260768 we dont expect our challenge will be selling the tickets
7260769 but were not going to assume we can do things the way theyve done before and expect our seats to be full
7260770 we are for sure wanting to turn the city into a place where everybody wants to go at night to come face to face with the events
7260771 the fact is not every citizen is going to go to the competitions not every citizen can afford to go but they can all be part of the event and be downtown
7260772 when we came up with the own the podium plan in partnership with everyone else who was involved particularly the sport organizations we basically went to them and said what do you think you could do and how much money to you need to achieve it
7260773 they said we think we can be no 1 and we need 110 million we got the 110 so it would be somewhat hypocritical to say its not enough when they gave us what we asked for
7260774 we may for example ask businesses to consider opening their businesses earlier in the morning and shutting down later
7260775 i think were going to get a high degree of co operation because its been our experience that everybody wants to help everybody wants to be on the team
7260776 i see this as an area of possibilities where we think about historic neighbourhoods and what they provided to the city what they provided to the province
7260777 and if we look at those things and work on them as an integrated way i think you will see significant improvements by 2010
7260778 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused

7260785 lloyd halgunseth wa6zzj district emergency coordinator in neighboring yavapai county called me late sunday morning requesting help to establish a communications link between peach springs and red cross headquarters in phoenix

7260841 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us
7260842 under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7260843 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7260844 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year

7260852 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7260853 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7260854 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7260855 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7260856 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7260857 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7260858 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7260859 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7260860 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7260861 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7260862 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7260863 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7260864 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7260865 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7260866 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7260867 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7260868 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7260869 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7260870 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7260871 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7260872 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7260873 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7260874 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7260875 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7260876 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7260877 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7260878 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7260879 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7260880 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7260881 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7260882 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7260883 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7260884 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7260885 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7260886 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7260887 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7260888 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7260889 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7260890 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7260891 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7260892 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7260893 this is a planning took where all things are going
7260894 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7260895 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7260896 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7260897 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7260898 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7260899 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7260900 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7260901 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7260902 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7260903 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7260904 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7260905 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7260906 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7260907 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7260908 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7260909 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7260910 da ado el aler n el cambio y la suspensi n y que se habr a necesitado m s de una hora para arreglarlo
7260911 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7260912 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7260913 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7260914 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7260915 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7260916 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7260917 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7260918 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7260919 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7260920 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7260921 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7260922 transcends identity theft related issues crossing over into cybercrime it also includes rewrites to federal computer crime laws that are designed to make it easier for police to punish hackers keyloggers and spyware purveyors whose acts may not do quantifiable damage under current law federal prosecutors can go after only computer crimes that result in at least 5 000 in damage or losses to a victims computer current law also requires that hacking cross state borders immunizing from federal prosecution crimes in which the hacker and the victim are in the same state but the approved senate bill would remove those requirements in criminal cases emphasis added the bill would also make it a felony to damage 10 or more computers with spyware or keyloggers regardless of how much damage is done it would create a new crime threatening to steal or release information from a computer with the intent to extort money or anything else of value from the person being threatened those offenses would carry up to five years in prison fines or both the senate bill also adds additional penalties for cybercriminals theyd be forced to give up any property used to commit their crimes or obtained in the process of those activities

7260932 nous avons eu cette semaine diff rents contacts avec les d cideurs politiques qui ont t porteurs despoir peut tre suis je na f de le penser mais je ne crois pas
7260933 viele von uns erhielten vor dem absturz von unseren verwandten sms aus dem flugzeug dass mit der maschine etwas nicht stimmte
7260934 wir wollen hier keine politiker mehr sehen wir wollen endlich wissen was wirklich passiert ist
7260935 am ende wird man die schuld dem piloten geben der ist tot und die sache wird im sande verlaufen
7260936 wer dann mehr energie verbraucht soll auch deutlich mehr zahlen und wer strom spart wird belohnt

7260941 no there was no fat lady singing but rather a club full of partyers singing their praise on atlantas newest nightlife attraction opera formerly eleven50 in midtown has gotten a 2 5 million dollar overhaul and is now nothing short of spectacular from the floor to ceiling red velvet drapes in the vip suites to the multiple tier bar levels overlooking the entire club to the outdoor patio with private cabanas water features and spectacular lighting opera has not only re defined what a club should elicit within ones emotions but sets the bar incredibly high for the numerous bars in remodels and construction in the downtown area
7260942 maar hoe lang duurt het voordat je gewend bent aan hardlopen op blote voeten
7260943 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7260944 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7260945 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7260946 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7260947 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7260948 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7260949 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7260950 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7260951 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7260952 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7260953 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7260954 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7260955 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7260956 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7260957 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7260958 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7260959 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7260960 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7260961 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7260962 the financial difficulties facing social security and medicare pose enormous challenges the sooner these challenges are addressed the more varied and less disruptive their solutions can be
7260963 schoolchildren of course have had incentive to cheat for as long as there have been tests but high stakes testing has so radically changed the incentives for teachers that they too now have added reason to cheat with high stakes testing a teacher whose students test poorly can be censured or passed over for a raise or promotion
7260964 starting with common entrance more and more students are passing with higher marks yet many of them can hardly read or write there was a time when very few students in the entire country passed eight subjects at o level nowadays there are many examples where large numbers in one school pass eight or more the bright students still pass eight or more however many mediocre students are doing the same more and more exams are being dumbed down
7260965 declared in effect that the real problem was that gce standard was too high and ought to be replaced by an examination presumably local which could be passed by students of lower ability than the 20 percent of upper secondary school forms for whom the gce examination was originally designed
7260966 i also believe the cxc exam is coachable since there are many teachers who can predict which subject topics are more likely to appear in any given year
7260967 this is due to analysis of certain patterns by the persons setting the exams every year
7260968 for years now there have been rumours about teachers keeping their best lectures for private tuition where maximum benefit could only be gained by the students who could afford this expensive method against those who couldnt however there has never been available proof of any of the above for the ministry to take corrective action
7260969 eric and joshua do an excellent job explaining the importance of data modeling and how to do it correctly rather than relying only on academic concepts they use real world examples to illustrate the important concepts that many database and application developers tend to ignore the writing style is conversational and accessible to both database design novices and seasoned pros alike readers who are responsible for designing implementing and managing databases will benefit greatly from joshuas and erics expertise
7260970 almost every it project involves data storage of some kind and for most that means a relational database management system rdbms
7260971 the data model is the foundation of the application im pleased to see additional books being written to address this critical phase this book presents a balanced and pragmatic view with the right priorities to get your sql server project off to a great start and a long life
7260972 this is a truly excellent introduction to the database design methodology that will work for both novices and advanced designers the authors do a good job at explaining the basics of relational database modeling and how they fit into modern business architecture this book teaches us how to identify the business problems that have to be satisfied by a database and then proceeds to explain how to build a solid solution from scratch
7260973 eric johnson and joshua jones combine a deep understanding of the science of data modeling with the art that comes with years of experience if youre new to data modeling or find the need to brush up on its concepts this book is for you
7260974 those on the ground floor may have to get sandbags to protect their stores from flooding if the water comes up too high inside the mall we cant even get in contact with the mall office because no one there is answering the phone
7260975 the reports were coming primarily from the east west corridor and no reports were received from tobago
7260976 the caribbean is the largest market outside of the united states there is a symbiotic relationship that exists between these countries and trinidad and tobago and dont ever believe that we can exist without them we cant
7260977 if those countries did not exist a large percent of our trade would just disappear caricom is as important to us as we are important to them
7260978 explain what we have been doing and to clear up any misconceptions
7260979 the pnm has never subscribed to referenda and that is unlikely to change very unlikely

7260986 i congratulate the team very sincerely and we are now contemplating national awards and we have to decide how to reward them
7260987 the cabinet has to decide how we recognise the achievement a holiday however is very unlikely in fact we will have an extra day of work if you wish productivity is what we are after
7260988 they have trinidad and tobago on the map they have done very well indeed better than many had expected i am quite happy

7261036 i wanted to do it in a different way so we decided to journey with a woman who was a victim of this social crime i cast my net across india across cities to find a character who would suit the films requirements
7261037 vaijanti lives just one km from the taj mahal the film begins with what vaijanti thought love was during the time of marriage and what love became eventually
7261038 to millions the taj is a symbol of love it has become a meaningless word see what is happening to women today killed for dowry going through abortion after abortion or being abused for bearing girls where is love in all this i thought of attacking the very symbol of love and show how loveless india has become vaijanti sitting alone on the lovers bench in front of the taj reminded me of the powerful image of princess diana
7261039 in documentaries we can examine issues more intuitively when you see such films you wonder why people clamour for fictional films when reality is more compelling vaijanti is real her emotions are real we are not giving her a script she is writing the script as she goes along
7261040 from the poorest of poor women working in the streets of delhi to the richest ceos in india she met them all she wanted to see what the future held for her daughters she wanted to know what her choices were
7261041 there is this amazing woman in rajasthan jasbir kaur who defied her in laws and husband and gave birth to her triplets all girls vaijanti was most inspired by her
7261042 her dilemma is should she compromise and go back to her husband she still has some love left for him or fight for her divorce and bring up the girls on her own she has passed her seventh standard and is from a poor family the odds are stacked against her
7261043 she had hardly ever stepped out of agra the only other place she had been was to her grandmothers place in kota rajasthan from upper class women in bars and discotheques to the women on the streets everyone was so empathetic there was tremendous solidarity shown by other women it was so beautiful we have to see how it is going to affect her influence her

7261075 our armed forces are under incredible strain and the only way that they can fill their recruiting quotas is by lowering their standards

7261169 i wonder if theyd do that debate for my campus group
7261170 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7261171 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7261172 thats what made me look at urbana because im originally from danville
7261173 thats preparing them for being a good citizen in the community
7261174 if youre a member of a group that has been a victim of that kind of activity you bring a different perspective
7261175 everybody needs that person of color to say hey look what im doing
7261176 is an area that weve really got to work on and weve got to get out and recruit
7261177 ive heard a lot of great things about the district
7261178 we dont rely just on african american candidates to give us a call
7261179 thought that this was a good place for us to learn a little bit more
7261180 if we have teaching staff with very little cultural contact with the type of students theyre going to be serving that is a challenge

7261184 a troublesome issue of successfully reaching and teaching minority students look at the minority adequate yearly progress reading scores theyre failing which means were failing them
7261185 it is imperative as a district that we recruit teachers with racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds
7261186 teachers who look like our minority students motivate the students and represent respect for education in that students race
7261187 weve tried to recruit minority teachers and administrators weve done a pretty good job on the administrative level
7261188 its been difficult to find minority candidates especially minority males and compete in the statewide and national market to get them to come to danville
7261189 we keep at it year after year and were going to continue to do that we dont want to become complacent

7261197 we lived in a two bedroom apartment sharing it with roommates
7261198 she really tried to go out and make one step and go out on her own taking care of me and a full time job on a regular 7 an hour
7261199 i didnt want to go back to a chinese environment
7261200 i dont feel like im in america if i go back to the chinese people i like it better here its not as crowded another reason why is i wanted to see the snow

7261214 paul was probably overqualified for the job he had a lot of energy he was aggressive in fundraising
7261215 paul brought some wonderful things to the museum he got things going we needed communication with the membership a newsletter and paul managed to produce four quarterlies while he was ill
7261216 he really excelled in forming partnerships and friendships among local groups many of which we are still following on with long after his passing
7261217 his illness and passing left us in extremely short circumstances
7261218 there were a lot of things that he assumed personal responsibility for that he apparently did not make fully known to anybody else so were still finding little surprises
7261219 essays on the historical geography of champaign county from the distant past to 2005

7261234 there are these resonant anchors that appear periodically throughout the piece high violin and viola echoes

7261245 unfortunately for sufferers of adhd and their families there are few clear conclusions that can be drawn from the research to date on the best treatment options in the case of stimulant treatment for children clinical studies do demonstrate short term relief but many families have concerns about administering stimulants to children in these cases atomoxetine represents a good option with clinical evidence demonstrating some effectiveness

7261292 they tell me that my lord is dead i am the wife of the duke drannon of trelaninth do they deceive me or not
7261293 i think i think that drannon is dead i am sorry
7261294 these people so despise me that they would think nothing of telling me a lie it is terrible to lose a husband who was a man of such great heart but not to know is even worse now i can begin to grieve
7261295 if there were only anything that i could do i never knew your husband but i knew his nephew and i can only imagine how great your loss must be
7261296 i am dessa it is an honor to meet your majesty i am the widow of his late excellency duke drannon of trelaninth and i am carrying his child
7261297 my lord has ordered me to seek safety in a fortified place
7261298 i am obedient to him but my own wish is to be as near to him as possible had he allowed it i would have stayed at trelaninth as it is this is the nearest i can be to my lord without disobeying him i will stay here
7261299 to the generosity of all you all the honorable gentlemen
7261300 justice is the virtue most needful in a king you have stood against the will of the whole city for the sake of the right you have defended the widow and the orphan against the plots of the proud your justice is known throughout the world but i learned today that mens praises fall short your justice shines like the sun i am in awe and forever in your debt
7261301 i met marys brother mark and her father at lionels wedding
7261302 i met the two grabens again eleven years later after the murder tell you about that later when they stopped by my mothers house to make a sort of formal confession of having suspected me of marys murder
7261303 another ten years passed before mark called me that would have been in about 1969 to say that his eldest daughter ruth was enrolling in college here and since i was in real estate could i help her find a place to stay
7261304 so all six of them mark his wife sarah ruth and his younger daughter anna and three sons the youngest two were a bit unruly to our amusement and marks embarrassment came to our house that september
7261305 i think it was the summer of 1976 when i finally paid him a visit eileen and the kids had gone to visit her parents in
7261306 i thought about the girl on the hillside long ago and thought to myself with wonder
7261307 following the shopkeepers instructions i turned off onto a gravel road and my tires raised clouds of dust the same dust i suppose that i had seen on old mr
7261308 it was a white two story house with chimneys on both ends and a covered porch
7261309 though he obviously admired old jacob graben and emulated his goodness the clean shaven son subtly differed from his grave father who seemed almost to have stepped out of another century
7261310 after dinner the rain stopped the sun broke through the clouds in the western sky and mark and jacob went out to the patio to look over the grateful cornfields the dusty leaves now green again and glistening with rainwater in sunshine
7261311 and just then i caught a glimpse of the old mans face
7261312 it was in the next dusk and dawn that i heard the tale of marks and marys childhood together told to me in the very furrows and fields and forests around that old farmhouse where they had spent it
7261313 it was the 1930s and beyond the fences all was ominous
7261314 from what mark said it seems that graben paid hardly any attention to his children in those years
7261315 conceited and malcontented children like to invent worlds because they think they can make better ones than the real one
7261316 when mary went to college mark lost a best friend almost a mother
7261317 the next year he began to fall in with the youngest son of the pastor child of his fathers old age who went by the strange romantic name of francis tristan he was a a troublemaker at school he was sent by his father to a boarding school near
7261318 a gangland murder had taken place there twenty years before
7261319 francis tristan was a bloodsucker borrowing from everyone he knew relying on his charm and easy manners to make new friends to replace those he lost to unpaid debts
7261320 they boarded a bus and soon they were walking among the looming skyscrapers of
7261321 how francis tristan insinuated mark into the role of paymaster for his own debts i dont know
7261322 alone again marks mind raced it took him a while to decide that hed been the victim of a scam but he knew these guys were the mafia and he remembered the bad debtor shot dead even in southern
7261323 but they would want him to ask his father for it
7261324 that idea so horrified him that he made a bolt for it
7261325 he didnt know how they had known when he was trying to get away
7261326 mark told me the words mary used to describe the way she felt after she got marks desperate phone call and resolved to get all the money she could she borrowed from lionel 100 everything he had and go to chicago to try to save her brother she was entering the labyrinth
7261327 yes ill need to tell you more about him you know of him already the writer of your love letter
7261328 when i was in college a lot of the upperclassmen were veterans going to school under the gi bill there was an age gap between us and them and a gap in life experience with men who had faced fire in
7261329 i was told by others that marcielo came from a noble lineage in southern
7261330 ive never quite understood that part of his story a boy fighting with the guerrillas in northern
7261331 i dont know what relatives wishes he was deferring to when he came back to haunt our university bored and restless for two years nor do i know whether it was to visit a relative or to attend a communist party cell meeting that he was on the train to
7261332 she invited him to come home with her to their farm you
7261333 mary and peter waited in the house and it was some time before the two men returned
7261334 mr marcielo said jacob graben after he had changed his clothes please inform us of the cost of your services so that we can compensate you for them
7261335 but you misunderstand me sir what i did for your son was not done for money but out of friendship
7261336 there can be no friendship between us mr marcielo and you are not the kind of man to whom i wish to be in debt please tell me what the cost of your services was so that we can repay you and then i hope there will be no occasion for further relations
7261337 both grabens children watched in horror too stunned for a moment even to object
7261338 will this be enough asked jacob graben and he produced 700 in cash more than mary or mark had ever seen before at one time
7261339 marcielo took the money without a word and went out of the house by this time darkness had fallen when he was gone graben ordered mary never to speak to him again and told mark that his penance would be to repay every penny of the money that they had had to pay to marcielo for his rescue
7261340 mary sobbing desperately knew she could not exit from the front door against her fathers will but there was another way a window below ground level where mary knew how to climb out
7261341 it turned out that marcielo had not taken the money after all
7261342 i must have gotten mixed up about the date dear i was expecting you tomorrow
7261343 im sorry but would you mind terribly taking a cab honey im entertaining tonight
7261344 what do you say to a game of chess out on the balcony
7261345 i think harder than i used to im more careful i dont let my desires get the better of me i think its habits of minds i picked up as a businessman
7261346 was it god heres where i get confused looking at the stars or listening to the wind in the palms i felt a presence but whose presence gods and yet what does this god have to do with the god the churches talk about the one who revealed the ten commandments who took human form and was born in a manger and died on a cross what does a church service have to do with a feeling that has usually overtaken me when im out in the midst of nature and so i guess i dont understand god anyway i guess i dont think about god very often but if you ask me do i believe in god well why what do you think
7261347 i took things on faith my beliefs were not my own i was a parrot
7261348 it dawned on me that all of it was just play acting and semantics that no one really meant anything by it and the only difference was between those who were confused and kept looking for meaning in the old conventional phrases and those who had outgrown that
7261349 think about it if people really believed that the soul lives forever and that god gives infinite rewards in heaven to those who believe in him if people really believed that faith could move mountains would they live the way they do people like that would all go as missionaries to china and die as martyrs in front of a red firing squad a few people do that and we think theyre crazy but most of us know better
7261350 gods an unnecessary hypothesis there used to be a lot that we didnt know and instead of saying we didnt know it we found it more satisfying to say god does that the more we know the less god does god was also a tool to frighten ignorant people into obeying the laws back when it was more difficult to enforce them by the power of the state so there was a reason to encourage confusion at the popular level to give the semantic expression of our ignorance about the forces of nature a personality and a scary one maybe we still need god for that purpose at least as far as the lower classes are concerned although we can enforce the laws much better now but we dont need to dress up our ignorance in theology anymore everything makes sense the whole order of things fits together and we see how it fits together
7261351 i dont know how they can keep talking about god we still talk about santa claus and jack and the beanstalk but only to children im sure all these pastors and priests know that theyre just making stuff up or repeating stuff somebody else made up they make a decent living at it they figure theyre providing a public service a social gathering some nice music some stories some public speaking maybe they are in a way but how can they go on telling these stories to grown ups doesnt the act get old a clown sometimes takes off the suit and the rubber nose and the face paint and dresses normally and doesnt tell jokes dont those guys ever want to tell dirty jokes or read science books dont they want to let their guard down sometimes
7261352 we could just be open about things just tell it how it is we wouldnt need all the mystery a simpler world what you see is what you get why do the skies need to be haunted by these old myths wed just tell people they have to figure things out for themselves they dont need to open their bibles
7261353 i have to go through the motions for her sake sit in the pews at church every sunday thinking thoughts like these
7261354 no more slaves no more masters power and wealth to the people
7261355 the woman this letter is addressed to mary was the wife of lionel english the first owner of this house my father knew him a little bit later in his life well he knew
7261356 anyway the amazing thing is that michael brewer was once charged with murdering her lionel english almost got brewer sent to jail for murdering his wife mr brewer was acquitted in the end and i dont think almost anyone in this county believes that he did it but you see why this would be interesting for him right nobody else was ever convicted they never found the body its an unsolved mystery to this day now this is new evidence i dont know who this guy is this peter marcielo ive never heard of him but if mary and peter marcielo were having some sort of affair maybe she ran away with him maybe she was never murdered at all it might be painful to remind him of it all still hed probably be glad to clear his name for good
7261357 how do we know that she accepted the offer how do we know she even read the letter
7261358 the dates january 4 1959 i think it was in 1959 that the murder trial occurred and i think it was in winter because the stories tell how they were searching the snowdrifts for her body so if im right this must have been written only weeks or days before she disappeared its a little bit odd that he would write a date on a love letter
7261359 he seems to have been a soldier maybe its a habit he picked up in the military
7261360 she must have read it you found it here in this crack
7261361 so she obviously hid it deliberately and why would she have hidden it unless it was a guilty secret she didnt want her husband to find it
7261362 strange to think that this letter was here in lionel englishs house all those years and he never found it
7261363 well he would hardly have accused his best friend of murder if he had seen this and then later he would still have wanted to clear his friends name
7261364 they were still friends even though english suspected him of his wifes murder
7261365 i dont know thats what i hear i was too young to know about it myself
7261366 and if she were alive is it possible that she wouldnt have sent no word to anyone
7261367 he sat there and i sat here and we played a game of chess
7261368 she went to bed afterwards we began to talk only the trees were not so tall then i looked out at the starry sky that must have been late in the summer because the trees were still green it was 1958
7261369 yes perhaps but thats not what i was thinking about
7261370 well richie thinks so hello cleavage lissa doesnt have a chance with him hold on hi may i help you
7261371 sorry to bother you i used to live here in college i just wanted to look around a bit if you dont mind
7261372 sorry about that you were saying her parents let her stay out as late as she wants in the summer but she gets in trouble for drinking so she waits till it wears off ironic that she got into the situation that way
7261373 he took an interest in me out of politeness and made small talk he seemed to want to be friends i didnt mind i found out that he was the son of a local businessman the owner of a medium sized building supplies firm that did business throughout southern indiana and
7261374 i told him my mother was a secretary and my father was a bum i said it without embarrassment but he seemed a little embarrassed
7261375 then i saw that there was a chessboard among his things
7261376 i told him about how id played my grandfather and my father when i was a kid and theyd taught me all their tricks
7261377 that was the first of dozens maybe hundreds of chess games that lenny and i played over the next three years
7261378 a little while later i discovered that the word innocence had in my mind become indelibly associated with an image a sleeping beauty dreaming on the grassy hillside in the slanting september sun as the apples leaves whispered overhead a book hanging limp and forgotten in her hand to symbolize the irrelevance of wisdom to happiness
7261379 lionel was horrified when i suggested that he confess to her how he felt
7261380 there was more than a year when they ate lunch together and took classes together and talked she confiding in him he holding onto his secret
7261381 then lionels luck changed marys lover went away to a distant country leaving her heartbroken and lionel was the one she turned to for comfort finally he asked her if they could be more than friends and she accepted he went to
7261382 i was the best man at lionels wedding and i looked handsome
7261383 a week later they gave me my papers and i was a free man i went down to
7261384 as the road ran past some farmhouses in the afternoon i passed a girl walking along the side of the road i stopped said hi asked her name
7261385 you look beautiful i said in a tone as if it were part of a phrase like you look beautiful in that dress only i didnt add in that dress then i said you
7261386 i dont tell lies often honesty is my one virtue but i told one in boligee
7261387 for two weeks i waited to see that face to see it in the flesh i mean for i saw it every waking moment in my mind as real as the sun
7261388 after work i found her as we had planned in the aisles of the general store we walked to the place where she had tethered her tall black horse i told her about my job and the cot in the garage which meant
7261389 we were on the edge of a mighty forest now and soon we were in its midst the canopy was full of insect music punctuated with bird calls but the trees were silent we rode for hours i think sometimes the trees broke and we looked out over ever widening vistas of the green
7261390 i love you i told her i want to see you as much as i can will you come tomorrow
7261391 one day she came to me with a bruised face
7261392 i doubt i could tell you all the places i lived i looked for work in
7261393 only two people had kept track of my changing addresses all this time
7261394 so little by little i started to think about going home when my mother heard how well i was doing in real estate she wanted me to come back to
7261395 the central otago region consistently produces top quality pinot noir so its no surprise that the area has produced this years champion wine of show
7261396 it is very encouraging to see such high quality wines being produced across a range of emerging varietals this is testament to the diversity of new zealand as a winegrowing nation
7261397 what are you looking at he is nothing i have only swatted a fly what are you looking at get out of here go back to your duties
7261398 many people thought these boats will make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of brining in goods equipment food and medicine
7261399 however once it turned out these boats contain too little food and mostly activists some people left the beach disappointed
7261400 the arab and muslim world should draw lessons and learn from those dozens of activists because they risked their lives at sea for the sake of strip residents and against the siege
7261401 we know whos on these boats and what they contain and therefore well allow them to reach shore
7261402 what kind of contribution does this journey make to the promotion of ideas of reconciliation and compromise none
7261403 attests to the israeli distress caused by this international peace initiative
7261404 the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7261405 but how do i make this work in my organization it cant be done
7261406 not only can it be done but there is more than one right answer
7261407 il est clair que le scrutin des prudhomales va avoir un c t juge de paix pour certaines organisations
7261408 si on arrive faire bouger les choses sur les salaires ou le pouvoir dachat ce sera utile pour notre lection
7261409 pour tre efficace il faut des bases claires et des modalit s claires
7261410 the icc board today agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy until october 2009
7261411 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7261412 the lawyers will want to go through the assets with a fine tooth comb
7261413 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7261414 this place serves the best ox tail soup and seafood tofu stew
7261415 well have 3 of those ox tail soups 2 seafood tofus 1 bibimbap oh and maybe some raspberry wine
7261416 im back im back so when are we going to catch up
7261417 i asked d friend from university days now adopted as my
7261418 how about lunch i can pop down to the city
7261419 the best pizza daily roast and pastas laid back urban communal tables and heinously popular
7261420 its eggplant and this particular dish is eggplant battered and deep fried its really quite delicious
7261421 saya hanya punya satu cermin di rumah saya yakni di kamar mandi dan di dalam lemari cermin di lemari itu hanya untuk memastikan apakah saya sudah benar menggunakan kaus kaki sementara di ruangan lain di bagian luar tidak ada sama sekali karena memang saya tidak suka terlalu banyak melihat diri saya sendiri akan tetapi dengan film mirrors ini saya selalu melihat diri saya pada saat sedang bekerja itu jelas merupakan sebuah aspek yang menarik dalam pembuatan film ini
7261422 arsitektur gedung ini sangat fenomenal kami tidak perlu banyak melakukan perubahan terhadap gedung yang setiap lantainya menggunakan tangga sebagai pendukung film ini yang jelas atmosfer dalam gedung ini benar benar menakutkan
7261423 harus saya akui dia punya imajinasi yang luar biasa setiap hari ketika saya untuk bekerja saya selalu melihat sesuatu yang baru meskipun inti dari alur cerita filmnya mengenai refleksi diri terhadap sebuah cermin
7261424 security has been tightened in and around tatas small car project more than 4 000 policemen have been deployed
7261425 our party will fight to the finish to get the land back
7261426 the government acquired 997 acres of land for the project the project needs about 600 acres
7261427 it is totally impractical to give back the land as demanded returning the 400 acres means scrapping the entire project
7261428 no puedo casi recordar cuando vi a mi padre por ltima vez en 1962 crec sin padre en casa de mis abuelos ni se donde vive ni financio su huida si estuviese muerto desconozco tambi n donde puede estar su tumba
7261429 entre 1962 y 1967 encontramos dos notas en nuestro buz n en ellas figuraba una nica frase estoy bien pero no puedo asegurar que esas cartas fueran realmente de mi padre
7261430 gritar a al mundo para que se entregue y responda a las terribles acusaciones
7261431 el pasado de mi padre es una parte de mi vida negarlo no tiene sentido aunque no tengo que explicar a nadie que no soy un nazi
7261432 hasta 1997 y a trav s de la polic a
7261433 saya tidak habis pikir mengapa kami bermaksud baik tapi akhirnya malah mendapat akibat seperti ini tapi saya sudah memaafkan pihak pihak yang seharusnya bertanggung jawab
7261434 orangtua mana yang akan menolak ketika ditanya apakah anaknya mau bertemu dengan presiden waktu ditanya apakah yuni mau bertemu presiden tentu saja saya bilang mau kemudian dikatakan bahwa biaya selama dua hari di jakarta ditanggung sendiri saya pun menyetujuinya
7261435 saya tidak tahu nama lokasi hotelnya karena saya tidak hafal nama nama jalan di jakarta pokoknya lokasinya tidak terlalu jauh dari kantor koni daerah dki jakarta tanah abang jakarta pusat besok malamnya saya tidur di rumah warga di sekitar situ
7261436 saya kirain dalam acara itu yuni bisa salaman dengan pak presiden taunya boro boro mau salaman berdekatan dengan presiden saja sulit meski di akhir acara yuni bersama ribuan orang berfoto bersama dengan presiden
7261437 sebenarnya harapan saya dari pertemuan dengan presiden tidak muluk muluk cuma supaya anak saya bisa disapa dan bersalaman selain itu saya juga berharap mendapat sedikit bantuan untuk ongkos ke riau cuma itu
7261438 sebelumnya saya sudah menghubungi ibu yani untuk meminta bantuan ongkos pulang tapi saya malah diminta menghubungi pak hendrik jamal karena katanya itu menjadi tanggung jawab pelatih sementara ketika saya menghubungi pak hendrik jamal dia bilang itu bukan tanggung jawabnya semua saling lempar tanggung jawab padahal yang saya minta cuma ongkos pulang ke riau karena yuni sudah lama bolos sekolah
7261439 sehingga kami tidak menanggung biayanya namun nama yuni ternyata diajukan oleh pada hendrik jamal akhirnya meski tidak kami undang kami tetap menerimanya dengan catatan kami tidak menanggung biayanya di jakarta dan ternyata orangtuanya setuju
7261440 kenapa ada pemisahan seperti itu meski berasal dari luar jakarta yuni tetap berhak diundang bertemu dengan presiden masa pemerintah tidak mampu membiayai ongkosnya yang tidak seberapa benar benar keterlaluan sementara kalau pejabat yang pergi dinas ke luar kota atau luar negeri semua ditanggung dari biaya hotel makan sampai dikasih uang saku ini pahlawan yang sudah mengharumkan nama bangsa kok tidak dibantu
7261441 het is frappant om te zien hoe overal in de wereld onafhankelijk van hoe rijk of arm een land is of welk politiek systeem het heeft discriminatie voorkomt
7261442 we have witnessed the spectacle of a presidents humiliation by his colleagues
7261443 the dark days will be worth all they cost if they teach us that political service is for the purpose of serving our fellow south africans
7261444 the unwritten economic and social compact that enjoys broad support across the political centre is coming under strain within the tripartite alliance
7261445 there are political illiterates among us who are trying to pretend the differences of policy and strategy between the anc and the ifp will be wiped out merely because the leader of the anc is a zulu
7261446 zuma has been a zulu all his life and he has always been a member of the anc he was an anc minister representing the interests of his party and this has nothing to do with being a zulu
7261447 co operation agreements with other parties should be made after the people have spoken at the ballot box and not before
7261448 a man threw a grenade into the middle of the party celebrating a wedding police spokesman pierre chanel ntarabaganyi said
7261449 due to the proliferation of illegal weapons acquired by civilians during the civil war that broke out in 1993 and left 300 000 dead
7261450 a man threw a grenade into the middle of the party celebrating a wedding police spokesman pierre chanel ntarabaganyi said
7261451 i would call it the oddest game i ever played in
7261452 he doesnt seem to get rattled at the same time hes understanding what he can and cant do up here i think hes growing into a guy who understands what his strengths and weaknesses are
7261453 hes had times out there when hes tried to do too much and hes been able to take a step back and simplify things get back into his game
7261454 you have to be confident put nervousness and being scared to the side try to be the same do the same as always
7261455 thats when mistakes happen when you try to do too much
7261456 we have been in contact with nathan and he will come across
7261457 im not sure what the flight details are yet but hopefully he will get here as soon as he can
7261458 there was a problem with my calf in beijing and i was taking injections to play that tournament
7261459 i had to take the injections so i didnt feel the pain otherwise i wouldnt have been able to go on the court and play
7261460 knock on wood i dont have any problems or injuries at the moment
7261461 i am just trying to get back in shape i am training hard to get as fit as possible for the tournament
7261462 i have been here seven years now and would like to stay even longer
7261463 i love the fans the scottish people and the scottish league i love the club i adore the club
7261464 i would like to honour my contract until the end until the last day last minute second
7261465 at the end of the year i will have completed eight years at the club
7261466 my wish is to sign another two years at celtic but that will be hard if i dont fit into the coachs plans you never know in life things can change
7261467 we are not yet in the armageddon struggle proper but at its commencement and it may be if students of prophecy read the signs aright that christ will come before the present war closes and before armageddon the war preliminary to armageddon it seems has commenced
7261468 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7261469 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7261470 be more concerned with your character than your reputation because your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are
7261471 lets plunge ourselves into the roar of time the whirl of accident may pain and pleasure success and failure shift as they will its only action that can make a man
7261472 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to those people who are actually in the arena who know the great enthusiasms the great devotions to a worthy cause who at best know the triumph of high achievement and who at worst fail while daring greatly so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
7261473 sab amos que la sand a es buena para la salud pero la lista de sus beneficios se alarga con cada estudio
7261474 produce maravillas en el coraz n en el sistema circulatorio y mantiene un buen sistema inmunol gico
7261475 es posible que la sand a no sea tan espec fica en cuanto a su uso como el viagra pero su consumo es una buena forma de dilatar los vasos sangu neos sin producir efectos secundarios
7261476 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
7261477 it had become the culture in his neighbourhood to visit igor to get your bike people accepted it
7261478 we love the book but because it is set in the 1960s we havent considered making it in the near future
7261479 obviously there are allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7261480 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7261481 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7261482 this perhaps is one of the greatest gifts that a zoo can bestow to show that animals are very much like ourselves and feel elation and pain gana lost a child but i think in that loss she taught people here so much
7261483 thomas aquinas and the scholastic tradition said very clearly that animals have not got souls and this has been used in the past to justify the exploitation of animals on the basis that they are just things
7261484 also the animals possess a soul and men must love and feel solidarity for our smaller brethren
7261485 we are living through an ethical revolution when it comes to animals
7261486 we are shifting from seeing them as objects commodities resources to seeing them as beings in their own right
7261487 oh dang i completely forgot about that little 4 000 sqauare footer on the beach down in the florida keys i just havent been there in 8 years
7261488 naaahhh i already play 4 or 5 times a week

7261495 the prayer that does not succeed in modulating our wishes in changing our passionate desire into quiet surrender is not true prayer
7261496 to inspire and empower the members of the upper columbia conference to make spirit led intentional and meaningful contact with each of the 1 8 million people in the conference within four years
7261497 to develop a strategic plan for upper columbia conference 2007 2011 making mission the priority and central focus of every church school ministry department and individual member to give particular attention to growth leadership accountability and resourcing
7261498 i hope you will help us maximize our strengths prioritize our resources and focus our energies on the core task that god has entrusted to the church to prepare the world for the soon return of jesus christ we must be willing to adjust budgets redeploy employees embrace technology take risks on new initiatives renew or discard worn out ideas and touch the lives of unreached people groups
7261499 my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he hath showed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mights from their seats and exalted them of low degree he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away he hath holpen his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever
7261500 this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness
7261501 i wish to say to you that the business which may be carried on at this meeting is just as much a part of the service of god as is prayer the business meeting is to be just as much under the dictation of the spirit as the prayer meeting there is danger of our getting a sentimental impulsive religion let the business transacted at this meeting stand forth in such sacredness that the heavenly host can approve of it we are to guard most sacredly the business lines of our work every line of business carried on here is to be in accordance with the principles of heaven
7261502 we are proud to have adam join his fellow 1994 stanley cup champion teammates mike richter mark messier and brian leetch
7261503 as well as legends rod gilbert and eddie giacomin as his number is raised to the rafters of madison square garden
7261504 i think there is a new kind of satire thats coming out it isnt necessarily targeted at individuals but rather at the system which people seem rather tired of
7261505 its almost like the politicians are second guessing the jokes that the comedians are going to do
7261506 i think were going to see a lot of that satire on the fringe next year
7261507 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands
7261508 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7261509 prudence is required in somalia where the situation is complex and journalists and humanitarian aid workers are often abducted by militias acting with very diverse motives
7261510 we are deeply concerned that our son may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7261511 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somali authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7261512 we are awaiting advice from the somali government we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7261513 they were simply doing their job of reporting the story and presenting the plight of somali people to the world
7261514 the town is calm today and were busy burying the victims of the fighting
7261515 he said he raised some points with the government and hoped to return in terms of concrete outcomes there was not much
7261516 make sure that the rhino was not stressed by having humans so close to it
7261517 a directive has been issued to the government which means the childs rights cant be violated in the name of culture
7261518 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
7261519 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
7261520 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
7261521 we applaud and plan to emulate the swedish approach for the best of reasons many residents believe that if you regulate prostitution you make women safe but as soon as you discover the violence and exploitation endured by women every day it cannot possibly be condoned
7261522 sexual exploitation is completely unacceptable so were doing what we can to address and tackle the demand
7261523 it is a myth that prostitution is the oldest profession and that it will always be with us we are in this for the long haul but do not underestimate the challenge it represents
7261524 no country or city has managed to get rid of the problem but countries such as sweden have begun to see an impact they have seen no growth in prostitution and a significant reduction in trafficking
7261525 there have been remarkable successes such as women going on to university and securing challenging jobs
7261526 do we really want to be known as the bangkok of the northern hemisphere
7261527 what kind of values do we wish to promote in our society we are committed to denying those who profit from this exploitation
7261528 i get so angry when i hear people who really havent properly researched the subject say blithely lets follow the swedish model
7261529 the people in glasgow who are promoting this sort of approach really should have the humility to ask why it is in edinburgh the number of people working as street prostitutes have dropped in aberdeen its stable and in dundee its stable
7261530 glasgow with its zero tolerance stance im afraid has the worst record of all in coping with the numbers of street prostitutes and they continue to rise
7261531 it is likely to be ineffective from the point of view of the general public from the point of view of the prostitutes and from the point of view of anyone affected by prostitution
7261532 studies show that criminalisation and clampdowns on kerb crawlers merely cause sex workers to work longer hours in greater isolation leaving them more vulnerable to attack as well as reducing their access to essential services
7261533 thai people will definitely be offended by the idea that the only thing people associate with bangkok is prostitution
7261534 he should have chosen his words more carefully you can make a point about problems in glasgow without having to drag another countrys reputation through the mud
7261535 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7261536 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7261537 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7261538 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7261539 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7261540 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7261541 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7261542 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7261543 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7261544 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7261545 it is not something to be proud of and it is something i have tried to give up on many occasions
7261546 david cameron was in the same position when he became leader of the tories but i note he was successful in giving it up so perhaps being labour leader in scotland will be the thing that will finally get me to kick the habit
7261547 iains very capable but his lack of charisma is a problem
7261548 but then the boss turned round and said in english no problem i studied at stirling university what about you
7261549 i said well i have experienced the mozambique health service and i can tell you it isnt
7261550 it is to our shame that there is significant poverty in scotland the necessity for supporting people is just as strong in scotland as anywhere else in the world the issues that concern people are the same everywhere they want the chance of a better job a decent wage they want their kids to have a decent education thats the same everywhere in the world
7261551 even in circumstances where we could barely imagine the difficulties there will always be people with aspiration and a willingness to work together and make things better
7261552 i have nothing against political banter but i do think that if you are the first minister of scotland no matter what party you come from there is a degree of dignity
7261553 i am a collar and tie politician if i go to a gala in my constituency i put a collar and tie on i might be the only one who wears it but my view is that i represent people and they are due that level of respect
7261554 my objective is to be first minister if i have learned one thing over the last four weeks it is that i want to do that even more than i thought i did

7261556 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7261557 we feel like its a bit of a disguise pick hes trying to disguise hes the most inexperienced candidate in the modern era
7261558 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7261559 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7261560 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7261561 i thought it was way too hard at least for me
7261562 i would have died if i went out that fast
7261563 on the starting line i was telling the guys remember all the guys whod love to be in our shoes right now ryan was one of those guys
7261564 we wouldve loved to bring home a medal for him but we did the best we could
7261565 obama has been outspoken about contributions from lobbyists vowing not to accept any contributions from them biden doesnt seem to have quite the same view

7261570 its phenomenal for them to be home but they dont feel connected anymore
7261571 but im doing ok i have my life on track
7261572 i have a couple of buddies in iraq right now and i dont want them coming home to the same problems i had to face
7261573 some of these veterans are truly more afraid of going to college than they were of going to iraq
7261574 given what they have been through they have a very low tolerance for that sort of thing
7261575 the war is not over for them when they come home
7261576 its playing over and over in their minds society seems oblivious to that
7261577 one of the most important things we do is give them a place to get together with people who understand their feelings

7261627 smoking is harmful not just to smokers but to the people around them
7261628 with england going smokefree on 1st july there has never been a better time to stop smoking we have already exceeded our three year target to help 800 000 people quit by 2005 06 and still more and more people are successfully kicking the habit
7261629 children are particularly affected by breathing the poisons in secondhand tobacco smoke because their bodies are still developing their bronchial tubes and lungs are smaller and immune systems less developed making them more vulnerable to the toxins in smoke despite smokers efforts to blow their smoke away or to not sit near children they are still causing harm people need to see secondhand smoke for the invisible killer that it is
7261630 for people with asthma the effects of smoking can be deadly 82 per cent of people with this serious condition tell us that other peoples cigarette smoke triggers their asthma and many cannot go out to bars and clubs without the fear of a fatal asthma attack about 800 000 people with asthma in england are also smokers themselves iv increasing their risk of asthma symptoms asthma attacks and permanent damage to the airways

7261632 many smokers believe that opening windows in the car and smoking in separate rooms will protect their children
7261633 the fact is this offers no protection to young children the only way to ensure a smoke free environment is to smoke outside the house and to not smoke at all in the car
7261634 children exposed to second hand smoke in the home and car are at a much higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome sids respiratory infections ear problems and more severe asthma
7261635 this message is an important one as a lot of people are still smoking in their homes and a lot more are smoking in cars
7261636 aboriginal people spend a lot of time travelling in vehicles and dont always understand the risks they think it will be ok if they have the windows down
7261637 obviously quitting is the best possible way to protect your family from second hand smoke but if you are not ready to quit just yet ensure that no one smokes in your home or car
7261638 its up to the adults to look after children as they cant remove themselves from situations where people are smoking
7261639 when heather began her courageous campaign to transform attitudes and the law very few workers were protected from second hand smoke
7261640 her campaign strengthened public health initiatives across canada and today more than 80 of canadians live in communities where the law requires that all restaurants bars and workplaces are smoke free
7261641 despite being in the public eye during the most private of moments heather remained honest determined and selfless
7261642 we are very grateful to those who helped us finance this video
7261643 there are several canadian governments which have not yet improved their labour code or smoking laws to protect all workers from tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces including the federal government and those in alberta british columbia and saskatchewan
7261644 if id lost my hand at work theyd have paid me
7261645 so if theyre going to take chunks out of my lungs why wouldnt i be entitled to benefits
7261646 its very sad that shes not going to be here to see the legislation take effect but she should be very happy that because of her influence ontarians will be able to breathe easier as a result of the legislation on may 31
7261647 she fell into this anti smoking passion because she experienced first hand what so many people have suffered over the years
7261648 my cancer is a smokers tumour and ive never smoked a day in my life
7261649 when youre done with your chemotherapy and youre on your knees at the toilet this is when i made my decision i can never let this happen to someone else
7261650 i never smoked a day in my life the air was blue where i worked
7261651 this is an industry that has lied about all aspects of its business and yet has managed to put responsibility for the epidemic on individual behaviour
7261652 i thought we should at least get into the 21st century at some point in 2006 when it comes to how we convey social marketing and basically the governments messages
7261653 the best thing that can happen is that people are aware of it make fun of it on you tube and go back to the original to see what they re making fun of
7261654 this advert explains why we are introducing smoke free public places the message is clear passive smoking kills
7261655 the case for reducing exposure to second hand smoke to improve health is indisputable in scotland second hand smoke is associated with up to 1 000 deaths a year among life long non smokers
7261656 scotland will become smoke free in enclosed public places from march next year our countrys health and productivity will improve and the incidence of smoking related disease will fall as a result
7261657 stubbing out smoking is the right decision for the smoker their friends and their families it will save thousands of lives and help keep families together for longer
7261658 we are confident that in time the improvement in public health delivered through the smoke free law will be regarded as one of the greatest achievements of devolution
7261659 this hard hitting campaign makes it clear that second hand smoke kills scotland will lead the rest of the uk when it goes smoke free in march the new law is the most important public health measure for a generation and will protect workers in scotland who are exposed to second hand smoke
7261660 evidence from abroad also shows that going smoke free will help smokers quit so the legislation will help make scotland a healthier nation
7261661 i am delighted to be able to support the ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland it is good that scotland is taking a lead on this important issue which will undoubtedly improve the health of the nation and save many lives
7261662 were optimistic that our partnership with the ad council will attract the publics attention and lead them to make positive decisions for their families
7261663 we recognize how powerfully addictive smoking is and we encourage smokers to quit and provide other programs to help them do so but we also recognize it is very difficult to quit and many smokers lack the tools and resources to do so effectively this campaign asks smokers that are continuing to struggle with their addiction to please be mindful of protecting their families from the devastating effects of secondhand smoke and not smoke around other people
7261664 were being tongue in cheek about the fact that cigarette smoke has some toxic gases involved and therefore its a hazardous situation for the secondhand breathers the non smokers who could be affected by it
7261665 it is a spot that is asking for consideration and etiquette and asking smokers to be sensitive to areas where they could be exposing non smokers to smoke it is essentially asking them to remove themselves from environments where they might be smoking and go outside
7261666 we are proud to continue our campaign with the american legacy foundation to further increase awareness on this critically important issue the new spots are humorous memorable and motivating

7261668 at the name of jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus is lord
7261669 i dont have to agree with someone 100 to work with them 20 of the time
7261670 however its important that we dont become complacent and slip back into old ways we need to remind ourselves of the real harm that exposure to second hand smoke causes a 20 30 increase in the risk of lung cancers and a 25 30 increase in the risk of coronary heart disease and make sure that people continue to be protected from these illnesses
7261671 such legislation in other jurisdictions has led to a major decline in toxic chemicals in the atmosphere of workplaces resulting in safer and healthier environments for people to work and socialise in
7261672 we are studying a group of bar workers in the republic where bars are smoke free and comparing them to their equivalents in northern ireland where smoking is still allowed we are looking at their exposure to the toxic chemicals released by tobacco smoke and testing their lung function to measure what effect their exposure or lack of it has on their health our study will also measure the air in a number of pubs to compare exposure to a range of different toxic chemicals pre and post implementation of the law
7261673 rupert murdoch is a born again christian and rick warren claims to be his pastor as a christian murdoch is committing an egregious sin by owning expanding and profiting from pornographic channels and rick warren as his pastor has a biblical duty to call murdoch to repentance and or put him out of the church
7261674 sadly murcdochs actions have already damaged his credibility as a christian
7261675 if pastor warren does not act swiftly and call on murdoch to dismantle his porn distribution network then the credibility of the christian message will be compromised around the globe
7261676 this is a clear case of a christian openly committing a monstrous and unthinkable sin the bible clearly states in 1 corinthians 5 that when a christian brother is openly and unrepentantly engaging in sins of this magnitude the church must discipline that person as his pastor rick warren has a biblical duty to call murdoch to repentance for this sin and or put him out of the church
7261677 warren and zondervan are currently working on an updated and revised edition of the purpose driven church that book is scheduled to be released later this year we hope that warrens business ties to murdochs company havent clouded his judgement and impacted his resolve to carry out his biblical duty as murdochs pastor

7261690 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7261691 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7261692 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7261693 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7261694 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7261695 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7261696 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7261697 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7261698 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7261699 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7261700 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7261701 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7261702 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7261703 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7261704 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7261705 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7261706 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7261707 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7261708 try to use that word or those words more often
7261709 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7261710 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7261711 la paura ti rende prigioniero la speranza pu renderti libero
7261712 quelli ke ti criticano sn quelli ke ti vorrebbero diversa xk vedono in te quello ke loro nn saranno mai

7261727 im told the illness problem is particularly affecting foremen and leading hands
7261728 its good for people to meet those in similar circumstances for a lot of the women they come here and their husbands are working and it can be quite isolating so its often a case of making contacts and friends

7261760 the negotiations carried out by this government have caused serious damage to israels status
7261761 the syrian government got red carpets in paris and received international legitimacy without their stances changing by a centimeter last month assad visited teheran after paris to emphasize that he is still loyal to them the iranians and he traveled to russia in the face of the entire western world
7261762 the west has worked for years to bring syria to normalization and their attempts havent worked the thought that what the entire world couldnt do we can do by giving them the golan height is na ve
7261763 the insane offers made by olmert in his attempts to reach a final status agreement will make it much harder for us to carry out future negotiations after so much has already been put on the table
7261764 the right way to look at the reality in the region is through the iranian lens iran is challenging the dominance of united states in the region teheran has flooded israel with its emissaries in the north with hizbullah and in the south following disengagement with hamas in gaza now the new danger is in the west bank and the golan heights and that is what negotiations under the current conditions could produce

7261842 were very sorry to tell you that avenged sevenfold will not be performing at reading today august 24th as many of you know the band had to shorten their set at leeds friday due to vocal strain since then matts doctors in the united kingdom and los angeles have both advised him that he must rest his voice and cannot perform thankfully there are no long term problems and with proper rest matt will return to the road shortly the band toured all summer with iron maiden throughout europe and the uk they returned home august 1st but because they wanted to play reading and leeds very much they returned this week for the festival they were blown away by the number of fans who came to see them play at leeds the band is still in england now and is extremely disappointed that they cant play a show they have been looking forward to for a long time a7x will return to the united kingdom at the beginning of 09 matt will post a personal message shortly but we wanted to get you the news immediately
7261843 time sure flies when you dont know what youre doing
7261844 im actually in canada recording at a studio near peterborough my record company has this studio which is like this cottage studio compound on a lake and its very beautiful weve been here for about a week and a half working on a brand new studio cd that will be available next year in the meantime im promoting this upcoming release as well
7261845 were very excited about it its the first time in a long time that ive had an opportunity to really kind of isolate myself without any distractions and just get to work with the guys its been difficult logistically to get together we all live in florida but were all in different places and of course were working every other weekend its not like youre in a big hurry to get together and rehearse or anything after youve been holed up in hotels airports and rental cars hey lets rehearse tomorrow yeah right laughing
7261846 as i said ive not had an opportunity to really concentrate on music for a cd exclusively in a long time so what youre going to get here is a whole bunch of ideas that have been stacked up in a holding pattern for the past twenty five years which are finally getting a chance to come out in a cohesive way
7261847 yeah since about 1977 we did putting it straight in toronto in the summer of 77 time sure flies when you dont know what youre doing

7261854 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7261855 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
7261856 it had become the culture in his neighbourhood to visit igor to get your bike people accepted it
7261857 we applaud and plan to emulate the swedish approach for the best of reasons many residents believe that if you regulate prostitution you make women safe but as soon as you discover the violence and exploitation endured by women every day it cannot possibly be condoned
7261858 sexual exploitation is completely unacceptable so were doing what we can to address and tackle the demand
7261859 it is a myth that prostitution is the oldest profession and that it will always be with us we are in this for the long haul but do not underestimate the challenge it represents
7261860 no country or city has managed to get rid of the problem but countries such as sweden have begun to see an impact they have seen no growth in prostitution and a significant reduction in trafficking
7261861 there have been remarkable successes such as women going on to university and securing challenging jobs
7261862 do we really want to be known as the bangkok of the northern hemisphere
7261863 what kind of values do we wish to promote in our society we are committed to denying those who profit from this exploitation
7261864 i get so angry when i hear people who really havent properly researched the subject say blithely lets follow the swedish model
7261865 the people in glasgow who are promoting this sort of approach really should have the humility to ask why it is in edinburgh the number of people working as street prostitutes have dropped in aberdeen its stable and in dundee its stable
7261866 glasgow with its zero tolerance stance im afraid has the worst record of all in coping with the numbers of street prostitutes and they continue to rise
7261867 it is likely to be ineffective from the point of view of the general public from the point of view of the prostitutes and from the point of view of anyone affected by prostitution
7261868 studies show that criminalisation and clampdowns on kerb crawlers merely cause sex workers to work longer hours in greater isolation leaving them more vulnerable to attack as well as reducing their access to essential services
7261869 thai people will definitely be offended by the idea that the only thing people associate with bangkok is prostitution
7261870 he should have chosen his words more carefully you can make a point about problems in glasgow without having to drag another countrys reputation through the mud
7261871 obviously there are allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7261872 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7261873 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7261874 it is not something to be proud of and it is something i have tried to give up on many occasions
7261875 david cameron was in the same position when he became leader of the tories but i note he was successful in giving it up so perhaps being labour leader in scotland will be the thing that will finally get me to kick the habit
7261876 iains very capable but his lack of charisma is a problem
7261877 but then the boss turned round and said in english no problem i studied at stirling university what about you
7261878 i said well i have experienced the mozambique health service and i can tell you it isnt
7261879 it is to our shame that there is significant poverty in scotland the necessity for supporting people is just as strong in scotland as anywhere else in the world the issues that concern people are the same everywhere they want the chance of a better job a decent wage they want their kids to have a decent education thats the same everywhere in the world
7261880 even in circumstances where we could barely imagine the difficulties there will always be people with aspiration and a willingness to work together and make things better
7261881 i have nothing against political banter but i do think that if you are the first minister of scotland no matter what party you come from there is a degree of dignity
7261882 i am a collar and tie politician if i go to a gala in my constituency i put a collar and tie on i might be the only one who wears it but my view is that i represent people and they are due that level of respect
7261883 my objective is to be first minister if i have learned one thing over the last four weeks it is that i want to do that even more than i thought i did
7261884 we love the book but because it is set in the 1960s we havent considered making it in the near future
7261885 a directive has been issued to the government which means the childs rights cant be violated in the name of culture
7261886 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
7261887 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
7261888 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
7261889 the town is calm today and were busy burying the victims of the fighting
7261890 he said he raised some points with the government and hoped to return in terms of concrete outcomes there was not much
7261891 make sure that the rhino was not stressed by having humans so close to it
7261892 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7261893 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7261894 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7261895 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7261896 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7261897 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7261898 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7261899 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7261900 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7261901 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7261902 this perhaps is one of the greatest gifts that a zoo can bestow to show that animals are very much like ourselves and feel elation and pain gana lost a child but i think in that loss she taught people here so much
7261903 thomas aquinas and the scholastic tradition said very clearly that animals have not got souls and this has been used in the past to justify the exploitation of animals on the basis that they are just things
7261904 also the animals possess a soul and men must love and feel solidarity for our smaller brethren

7262060 ibu ingin menceritakan kejadian yang menyebabkan ibu mempunyai wajah seperti ini dulu saat kamu masih bayi kamu sakit keras sehingga ibu harus pergi ke apotik untuk membelikanmu obat karena ayahmu dan ibu tidak punya uang untuk membawamu ke dokter sementara ibu pergi ayahmulah yang menjagamu ibu dengan buru buru membeli obatnya dan segera pulang tetapi tidak tahu mengapa gorden di rumah kita bisa terbakar ayahmu dan ibu tidak mengetahui kejadian itu sebelum melihat asap yang tebal menggumpal di dalam rumah dan api sudah sangat besar ketika kami menyadarinya aku dan ayahmu berusaha menyelamatkanmu tetapi ayahmu tertimpa kayu jatuh yang terbakar dan menyebabkan dia tidak bisa pergi ibu berusaha menyelamatkan ayahmu tetapi wajah ibu terkena kayu terbakar yang jatuh hampir menimpamu tetapi ayahmu tidak bisa diselamatkan

7262062 seals hit by boat propellers have a zipper like pattern across the top of the neck because they dont swim upside down but this seal was hit from below which is how sharks attack their prey
7262063 the bite measures over a foot 0 3m across so i dont know what else could have taken a chunk of this size
7262064 i was sceptical at first but i cant think what else it could be

7262082 you there by the threshold of our door come in and sip with us our arabic coffee you may even feel that you are human just as we are you there by the threshold of our door take your rockets away from our mornings we may then feel secure and almost human
7262083 we have to understand not justify what gives rise to this tragedy its not because theyre looking for beautiful virgins in heaven as orientalists portray it palestinian people are in love with life if we give them hope a political solution theyll stop killing themselves
7262084 poetry and beauty are always making peace when you read something beautiful you find coexistence it breaks walls down i always humanize the other
7262085 foram tantos anos de prata no mundial fui t o criticado mas sem a grande dor ningu m valoriza o grande prazer
7262086 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of world
7262087 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7262088 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7262089 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7262090 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7262091 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behaviour in any meaningful way
7262092 a court in saudi arabia is reported to be preparing to hear a plea for divorce from an eight year old girl who has been married off to a man in his 50s
7262093 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low

7262095 the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror
7262096 well others could come forward just as much as i could the interesting thing was i didnt hesitate
7262097 people expect regardless of whether were smaller or not theyll expect us to do something profoundly positive as well and leave our mark
7262098 there are a lot of pieces that need to pulled together still before we can get to a seamless operation of the games
7262099 of course they are all in play but theres still lots of work to do
7262100 we dont expect our challenge will be selling the tickets
7262101 but were not going to assume we can do things the way theyve done before and expect our seats to be full
7262102 we are for sure wanting to turn the city into a place where everybody wants to go at night to come face to face with the events
7262103 the fact is not every citizen is going to go to the competitions not every citizen can afford to go but they can all be part of the event and be downtown
7262104 when we came up with the own the podium plan in partnership with everyone else who was involved particularly the sport organizations we basically went to them and said what do you think you could do and how much money to you need to achieve it
7262105 they said we think we can be no 1 and we need 110 million we got the 110 so it would be somewhat hypocritical to say its not enough when they gave us what we asked for
7262106 we may for example ask businesses to consider opening their businesses earlier in the morning and shutting down later
7262107 i think were going to get a high degree of co operation because its been our experience that everybody wants to help everybody wants to be on the team
7262108 i see this as an area of possibilities where we think about historic neighbourhoods and what they provided to the city what they provided to the province
7262109 and if we look at those things and work on them as an integrated way i think you will see significant improvements by 2010
7262110 beijing washingtons top diplomat in china pressed the government to immediately free foreign activists jailed for protesting during the olympics and criticized beijing on sunday for failing to use the games to show

7262117 as a person and a personality for the sport hes got a great pr company
7262118 hes done something that many fighters have taken many years to achieve and havent been able to achieve and hes done it in a very short period of time so if hes able to combine that with his physical strength and learn some more technique and maybe getting some more experience then maybe he would get to a level of popularity that could transcend the sport

7262257 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7262258 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7262259 obviously the ultimate goal is to avoid labs having to use animals altogether eventually
7262260 it is showing the model we use explaining how we go about making it and how these skin equivalents are used to guide and minimise the use of animals when we develop new wound healing therapies
7262261 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7262262 so we deconstruct the skin and its cells and then reconstruct them we cannot use the skin off cuts themselves as those cells are dying and we need to get the cells back to a state where are growing healthily again

7262331 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7262332 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7262333 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7262334 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7262344 well bring you all the news stories first before its even true
7262345 and they still do but in many ways there arent a lot of surprises in political conventions anymore
7262346 were not c span they perform a public service but we provide more than that
7262347 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers will leave the theater thinking retard is an ok word to use
7262348 i have a mentally handicapped brother and when we were growing up all i heard was the word retard
7262349 people called him that and other cruel names it was terribly painful for both of us
7262350 i hope she will get it in time to wear to the convention
7262351 bigger shoulders will make a shorter man look stocky and shorter

7262353 im a self proclaimed workaholic all i do is work
7262354 im always working on my craft as a songwriter working on trying to find that best song
7262355 i go home spend time with my family sit on the couch watch television and eat doritos
7262356 i came here the day after finishing the martin scorsese
7262357 i just had the flight time between the two filming schedules essentially thats how its working out its pretty well back to back right now
7262358 which is great because the variety of work i can choose to do now is stupendous i can choose to do a film like
7262359 i can also really allow myself to push the parameters of recklessness in my work i dont mean in my discipline but i do mean in the performance although im absolutely word perfect on the text i did allow myself to be a lot looser and more reckless in
7262360 and i can also choose to play a silly little role like in
7262361 for the most part if you look at my cv
7262362 very often im either the moral center of the film or the political center of the film but to be part of the comedic half of the film as in
7262363 so those four films in philadelphia pretty well represent what im allowed to do now what i allow myself to do and the great position i find myself in which is having these wonderful choices so i say yes i can do that for mike myers that would be wonderful as well as of course doing this immensely committed and dedicated role with penelope in elegy
7262364 there was no accent there is no disguise the clothes i wore could have been mine
7262365 its the closest that ive ever been to sounding and looking like me
7262366 but in order to be challenged by the role and feel the danger in playing him i had to get out of my suit of armor i had to get out of my actors disguise tricks so that was a constant challenge hearing my own voice coming out of my head saying those lines
7262367 i think for me the sustained difficulty was not to judge the character nor to sentimentalize him but ushering him up exactly as he is to the audience and let them accept him without any filtering of my judgment
7262368 so i had to be free of any judgment of him positive or negative and as i say to remove as many layers as possible through which to filter him
7262369 she brings a female essence to a tale of a man and a woman
7262370 people cant quite always get past the sexual politics in some fiction you know if one were writing a biography about hitler it wouldnt necessarily mean that youre a fascist but you do have to explore that mind set
7262371 in may of 2007 my younger brother graduated from marine boot camp the ceremony was to be held in south carolina at parris island about an 8 hour drive from our home in virginia since i wanted to be there for this special moment in my brothers life i made arrangements to drive down there with my little ones and spend the weekend in a hotel as the kids were only 10 months old and just turned 2 years old at the time i had a lot of packing to do plenty of snacks and toys for the car ride check blankies loveys and dollies check matching patriotic outfits check diapers hmm i had a decision to make i could spend 20 and buy a couple packs of disposables for the trip that would have been easiest however im stubborn and decided to stick with our usual bumwear of prefolds and covers i packed our entire diaper stash into a collapsible laundry basket i also took along a couple heavy duty trash bags for dirty diapers a box of baking soda and a bunch of grocery bags to keep in my diaper bag the weekend was absolutely amazing kids did great on the long car ride down touring the base was very interesting as it was my first time on one and of course the reason for the trip seeing my brother in his uniform was just awe inspiring i was so proud of him diaper wise things went smoothly as well when we were out and about i would put the dirty diapers in a grocery bag and shove it in the bottom of the stroller at night in the hotel i rinsed out the poopy ones and left them to drip dry over the edge of the toilet the next morning everything went into the trash bag with a liberal sprinkling of baking soda i made sure to put a note on the bag just in case so the housekeeper wouldnt toss it away while we were gone yes it was a bit more work but in the end i am glad that i stuck to it my brother was doing his part to protect our country and i am doing my part in protecting the environment

7262441 while there are mixed viewpoints most christians believe giving 10 of ones income is essential
7262442 abraham gave a tenth and was blessed tithing was mandatory for israel by law but we are now free from the curse of the law jesus said give and you will be blessed so we dont have to tithe but we must give in order to be blessed
7262443 i give more than 10 of my time and love to the homeless and less fortunate as jesus tells us to do thats tithing
7262444 the sun rises and sets on the just and unjust i tithe and receive blessings but i also know that some people dont tithe and they receive blessings as well

7262446 our poll showed that most believers view the bible as the infallible inspired word of god which can be accurately interpreted
7262447 since god cannot contradict himself a contradiction in the bible would mean that the bible is not gods word then it is not worthy of our trust and is simply a regular book
7262448 no contradictions just misunderstood readings a lack of knowledge of hebrew language idioms and misapplication of modern western thought and tradition with textual studies
7262449 i wonder why it says god is love but he created hell for people and rebellious angels to live in forever that seems like the ultimate hate crime to me
7262450 david is looked upon as a man after gods heart but he killed a soldier and slept with his wife also jacob lived a crooked life but god still blessed him instead of his brother esau who tried to live an upright life
7262451 the bible was written by men in the context of the times they lived in contradictions arise because of time and cultural differences
7262452 research shows that there are contradictions but the holy spirit seems to say that there are not
7262453 if there are contradictions its manmade anyway there is enough truth in the bible for any life

7262493 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith heres how joe biden responded he never moved to washington instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done he raised his boys first as a single dad then alongside his wonderful wife jill who works as a teacher he had a beautiful daughter now his children are grown and joe is blessed with five grandchildren he instilled in them such a sense of public service that his son beau who is now delawares attorney general is getting ready to deploy to iraq and he still takes that train back to wilmington every night out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident he did more than become a senator he raised a family that is the measure of the man standing next to me that is the character of joe biden

7262526 it does my heart good that when i showed up here and started talking to the leaders we discussed education and govt and not once talked about security
7262527 this is a huge step in this area because it proves that weve turned a corner and are now focusing on rebuilding western al anbar province
7262528 a lot of these men come from different tribes and different backgrounds
7262529 when they enter their office they must take off the tribal robe and perform as public servants for the whole district theyre still adapting and our job is to help them through the transition
7262530 so far weve been able to solve the electricity and water problems in the city
7262531 progress happens step by step and we hope it continues
7262532 i want to thank the cf for supporting the classes to improve the leadership
7262533 its good for the govt to have new ideas on how to improve everything
7262534 the 132 kv substation in east diwaniyah is very important for the electrical grid in this region this new substation will reduce the load currently on 2 33 11 kv substations built in 2003 to a reasonable level
7262535 the substations built in 2003 are part of the master plan developed by the iraqi ministry of electricity but were not built to handle the current demand for power
7262536 more substations are being built throughout the qadisiyah province and when finished will link together forming a stabilized grid
7262537 with the help of iraqi engrs like dukman working with contractor pauwels international who has employed hundreds of local iraqis this project is nearly complete
7262538 working with the ias can be hard because very few of them speak english
7262539 even when talking to americans now we find ourselves talking with gestures
7262540 everything we do they want to do a big part of our job is training but they came to us very well trained in vehicle and personnel searches we mainly conduct refresher training for them now
7262541 each day they impress us with something when we try to teach them and it turns out they already know the task a lot of them have quite a bit of combat experience
7262542 well have been out here for 2 weeks on saturday
7262543 it seems like forever its hot and lonely out here
7262544 we just have to take it one day at a time
7262545 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7262546 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7262547 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7262548 if i got it i got it but its supposed to be fair play theyre supposed to go by the rules
7262549 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7262550 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7262551 winning bronze is not the same as going home empty handed
7262552 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7262553 this is crazy and this would never happen in australia
7262554 i hear this grunting noise and i look down and at first i thought it was a mass of seaweed then all of a sudden its this huge mass coming down
7262555 it snorted at my sister she was shocked and screamed that it was one of those elephants of the sea my nephews were amazed
7262556 at first we only saw the silhouette but then we saw the entire back and the tail
7262557 carla bruni sarkozy kennt das leben in unseren bergen nicht mit ihrem einsatz unterst tzt sie nur die kologische lobby
7262558 der olympiasieg im basketball bedeutet nicht nur uns als spielern eine menge sondern auch den menschen in den vereinigten staaten

7262560 viele leute sprechen dar ber dass nba spieler egoistisch und eigensinnig spielen da drau en hat aber ein team gewonnen wir haben uns den schwierigkeiten gestellt diese gemeistert und ein gro es finale gewonnen
7262561 das ist ein gro er moment f r lebron james dwyane wade carlos boozer und mich

7262563 es gibt nur ein dream team diese mannschaft war etwas spezielles einzigartig sie hat den basketball ver ndert und hat eine menge junger menschen motiviert diesen sport zu betreiben

7262565 obama h rte sich an als ob er die top position seiner pr sidentschaftsbewerbung heute an seinen neuen mentor abgegeben hat
7262566 die wahrheit ist es hat sich nichts ver ndert seit joe biden zum ersten mal feststellte dass barack obama nicht bereit ist dieses land zu f hren er war nicht bereit und er ist es jetzt auch nicht
7262567 doch ich betrachte ihn als guten freund und guten mann
7262568 wir haben zudem viele unterschiedliche ansichten in fragen der nationalen sicherheit

7262572 i am so proud of jon said shuler on thursday while at milligan college to speak on faith character and athletics at milligan colleges seeger memorial chapel as part of milligans commitment to character counts
7262573 on and off the field he has really matured since hes been there personally hes matured and become a leader
7262574 jons a better football player than he is a worker said shuler
7262575 thats not to take away from his work ethic because he was a hard worker for me
7262576 anybody can say what they want i know for me im clean
7262577 i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can say what they want but the facts are the facts
7262578 one game one time it can always happen thats going to happen but you just dont want to look bad like we did in 2002 in indianapolis and 2004 in athens it wasnt just that we lost that was a small part of it really we want to be known as having a good attitude and off court stuff and we want to win
7262579 but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7262580 i tell people that you get to know joe biden the closer you get to wilmington del and when you see him with his family then you know the man
7262581 i liked to go at night when i thought there was a better chance of finding a fight
7262582 i was always looking for a fight i had not known i was capable of such rage
7262583 i felt god had played a horrible trick on me
7262584 the rule in the office was if the boys called he was to be interrupted no matter what he was doing or who he was talking to
7262585 because joe knows what its like to be down and out
7262586 the cause of death is not immediately apparent so toxicology tests are required
7262587 the original judge reasoned that because jmris code was given out for free the company shouldnt be able to sue and get money when someone breaks its license
7262588 attribution and modification transparency requirements directly serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform downstream users of the project which is a significant economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce
7262589 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada
7262590 however the government must ensure that canadian taxpayers receive the best value for their money
7262591 with those new ships our ability to protect canadians where they live and where they work at home in canada around the continent or across the world will be enhanced
7262592 they have all these grandiose announcements and then turn around and say they cant do it
7262593 why do they play around like that with the emotions of the men and women of the military
7262594 now we found out that the government has sent someone over to europe to see if those ships can be built there
7262595 they dont mind making these announcements in broad daylight during the middle of the week when they have national media attention
7262596 but when they decide to cancel theyre like a little mouse in a church like no one will notice but were noticing
7262597 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7262598 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7262599 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7262600 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the centre of an international crisis
7262601 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7262602 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7262603 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7262604 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words
7262605 ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7262606 the ocean the skies the clear crisp and laid back lifestyle theres no rush theres no big boom you know its something to look forward to
7262607 im used to finishing on top and im very fortunate and lucky to have that distinction
7262608 its a little bit much to ask that i do it every single time but thats what i wanted its not a failure you shoot for the stars sometimes you only make it to the moon
7262609 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7262610 i ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot which probably isnt the best way to deal with something like that
7262611 i didnt know what else to do i probably had four or five cold showers that didnt do anything either i tried to read but i wasnt interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say yesterday or today which is strange because i usually eat it up
7262612 i said i wanted to be strong confident triumphant and the last one was adam
7262613 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with for the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races until now but they really dont matter once you get here because its this one that counts puts a lot of pressure on me and it has put a lot of pressure on me
7262614 he learned very early how to win gracefully and i was always very proud of that
7262615 hes i think dealing with not being no 1 as gracefully im proud of him still its a new thing he learned
7262616 the last 24 hours have been quite difficult whereas the 24 hours following my thousand performance in athens were elated and quite relieved and very happy and that contributed to my 500 performance
7262617 i guess could say similarly that the disappointment contributed to my 500 performance today in a very different way
7262618 i didnt have that usual pop that i do at the 200 metre mark but i went for it marnie mcbean former canadian rower told me to fight like a tiger and i tried to it was really tough thats why kenny passed me i was toast
7262619 they broke into the computer room and stole all the computers
7262620 we believe that the german investigation ceased because of a lack of cooperation from south africa and we suspect that the british investigation may likewise also be ended due to a singular lack of assistance from the government
7262621 if this is untrue we challenge the minister of justice to refute this allegation by providing the public with substantive evidence that south africa is cooperating fully with the british authorities
7262622 by accessing the mlas we would be able to hold government to account in terms of whether it assisted the german and british investigations
7262623 it is essential that our government cooperates fully with the investigations and ensures that any south africans who benefited unlawfully from the billions of rands spent on the arms deal are publicly held to account
7262624 disclosure of the copy of the request as well as other documents which accompanied the said request will in my view prejudice the good international relationship that the republic of south africa has with the united kingdom
7262625 government has repeatedly stated that there were no irregularities in respect of the arms deal yet they continue to obstruct and prevent access to relevant documents
7262626 if there are no irregularities then government should have no reason to prevent those documents from being scrutinised and no reason to believe that the disclosure of any information in these documents would prejudice its reputation
7262627 we chose ice hockey players because there is a lot of aggressive behaviour in the games and its usually an acceptable way of performing successfully we could also measure this aggression in terms of the number of penalty minutes
7262628 these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
7262629 i feel honoured to have been given the responsibility of leading the team i hope ill be able to lift trophies obviously thats every players dream we wouldnt be here if we werent dreaming of winning trophies
7262630 they swallows can score two goals too it can happen
7262631 we had to play well because this is a cup competition there are no second chances if you dont play well youre out so im glad we were able to get the start we wanted hopefully we can carry that into the premiership season
7262632 its by phone and if you dont like it you can hang up
7262633 i dont believe in the 2 party system america is a diverse country we should have more than 2 viable parties to choose from
7262634 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
7262635 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
7262636 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
7262637 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
7262638 people worry that we are back in the bad old days
7262639 if they cannot keep promises among themselves how can they keep promises to the public
7262640 no democratic transition is smooth you dont just get democracy overnight
7262641 but in norway and in saudi arabia authorities have instead focused on corralling the foreign exchange earned in the sales of energy and investing it outside their borders creating an income stream for future generations
7262642 the bali declaration reaffirms the objectives of the convention and its importance for countries like indonesia to protect our health and the environment from contamination of hazardous wastes
7262643 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7262644 what a good time we had what a gentleman he was
7262645 two geniuses from two distinct periods in my life merging so easily so naturally so inevitably
7262646 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
7262647 i will appear personally at the hearing if required definitely
7262648 i supported him at court so why am i not going to do it at the fa
7262649 for me it is the same thing if you support someone you support them
7262650 if you believe they have turned a corner you believe they have turned a corner
7262651 if you believe that then what is wrong with saying it so i will just support him 100
7262652 i know a lot of people dont agree with me i have had lots of letters and i have seen all the postbags
7262653 after 38 games we will see who the winner is every old firm game is hard and you want to win every game
7262654 it doesnt matter where you are in the table you still want to win we are still hurting about this game we arent thinking about celtic so much
7262655 we have had two or three good games and i think this was our best performance
7262656 rangers can play better and better steven davies is back now and pedro mendes is a really good player and madjid bougherra is also doing well so we have a really good team
7262657 ive not won here for maybe two years three or four games
7262658 every time we come here its difficult but i thought we played very well and we lost two points
7262659 in the first half we were very good and had three or four chances to score and the goal in the last minute wasnt offside so we were very unlucky
7262660 we watched it afterwards on television and it was not offside
7262661 ive said many times that aberdeen is a hard hard club to come and play for
7262662 if barry nicholson had problems for six months then its not easy for those lads
7262663 the way it was played it was one touch football it was free flowing and it was exciting
7262664 it was a great finish i think you see that in the premier league it was a great advert for the a league and hopefully the fans saw that
7262665 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch
7262666 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7262667 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7262668 he is a combative player who can play in several positions he also fits well into our squad we have high expectations for him
7262669 i could have stayed in qatar but when the possibility of joining utrecht came along i didnt have to think for long and after that things went very fast other than the top clubs fc utrecht is the only club in holland i want to play for
7262670 in my first period here i had a good feeling and that hasnt changed i know the club and the technical staff and coach willem van hanegem too
7262671 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7262672 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7262673 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7262674 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7262675 i have got into a lot more goalscoring opportunities during pre season but didnt manage to score
7262676 but the mere fact i was getting into the right positions was a good sign
7262677 you are at this club to play in big matches
7262678 that is what you fight every day in training for you want to try and improve and you achieve that by pitting yourself against the best
7262679 because of the draw against newcastle we need to get a win as soon as possible
7262680 but it is not going to be easy you dont get many harder games than a trip to fratton park we have had some poor results down there over the past few years
7262681 it is something we are looking to rectify because we have a run of three away games around the super cup and internationals
7262682 i am surprised chris collins signed to because he shows little interest in buffalo he has ended the good plan to consolidate ecc downtown and has suggested redistibuting county tax
7262683 the fact that these expenditures are not only so large but are undisclosed is extremely troubling
7262684 are trying to influence the elections with millions of dollars that the public cant trace
7262685 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
7262686 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
7262687 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
7262688 enhance culture as part of the soft power of our country to better guarantee the peoples basic cultural rights and interests
7262689 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7262690 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7262691 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7262692 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7262693 the situation was carefully assessed by the administration and it was felt that it had become absolutely imperative to take action under law against these channels in larger public interest and for maintenance of public order
7262694 notices had been issued to them local channels not to telecast any such news or any other item which could vitiate the law and order situation and inflame passions with a view to fuelling public disorder
7262695 we extend warm congratulations and heartfelt compliments to you who have won immense glory for your country and people
7262696 achieved a major historic breakthrough written a new chapter of chinas sports development and made significant contributions to the hosting of a high standard and unique olympic games in beijing
7262697 we hope you will earnestly sum up your experience and refrain from complacency and make persistent efforts to win even greater honour for the motherland and people we hope to see you make new contributions to chinas sports development and the promotion of the olympic spirit and the international olympic movement
7262698 we made our presence recently in new york which was our 20th chapter and will soon make our presence in sigapore by next year
7262699 of our 1 5 lakh members 10 000 are abroad and we are further spreading our wings
7262700 we are in talks with seven more countries and we hope to break ice with them
7262701 the world will travel to india for accountancy and auditing india will be destination for accountancy in service sector
7262702 it concerns the livelihood of the people of singur and job opportunities
7262703 we ask people not to be misled by propaganda by the opposition parties carrying out a destructive movement against the nano project
7262704 the two countries have established a good neighbourly partnership and enjoyed friendship generation upon generation
7262705 mr prime minister has come to the beijing olympics closing ceremony within a week after being sworn in
7262706 this fully demonstrates the great attention nepal attaches to relations with china and its profound friendship with the chinese people we highly appreciate that
7262707 the police failed to save swamiji who was killed shortly after a threat notice
7262708 it was a criminal negligence on part of top police officers
7262709 swamiji was opposed to religious conversion taking place in various parts of orissa those opposed to swamijis anti conversion activities killed him
7262710 the killing of the swamiji proves law and order has collapsed in the state
7262711 the success of the beijing olympic games is attributable to the concerted efforts of the chinese people and people from the rest of the world
7262712 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends across the world who have been involved in the games in various ways
7262713 a grand event of international sports competition and cultural exchanges
7262714 unmark as this week on c9 brian keller returns photosynth olympics evnet source code and more
7262715 just go get that good for nothing wolf and stop showing off you know youre the only one who can do that
7262716 we heard what happened and you can stay with us if you want
7262717 so you have figured me out have you young one
7262718 estos sellos son muy especiales no s lo porque celebran los maravillosos juegos de pek n sino porque tambi n nos llenan de emoci n por lo que vendr cuando el anfitri n sea el reino unido
7262719 the victim believed to be aged 18 years was taken by london ambulance to whipps cross hospital he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival
7262720 but this is a qualified support as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7262721 but one reason influencing some christians may be what pope john paul ii described as the loss of christian memory in european institutions and policy
7262722 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7262723 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7262724 it has not been unknown for example for individuals to have to defend their right to hold political public or legislative office within eu institutions while professing a public commitment to their christian faith sometimes against very public and hostile challenge
7262725 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7262726 i think the people who are hostile to europe need to open their eyes to the contributions of europe and those who are totally supportive of europe need to listen to the concerns and the reservations we need a respectful listening to the views of each side
7262727 because i know the part that irish politicians and civil servants and diplomats have played in framing this
7262728 im raising these subjects to have them debated in the cooler calmer atmosphere people will recognise the distinct advantages but also the reservations
7262729 its amazing this is what i get paid to do and this is what i work for
7262730 this is all i really know to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7262731 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7262732 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7262733 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7262734 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7262735 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7262736 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7262737 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7262738 we are involved in the design phase of this power station
7262739 gradually the complementary design phase and its building will begin
7262740 the site has been chosen and the preparation process is under way
7262741 the fact that you have to look at your cell phone even for that one second is dangerous
7262742 you see people texting and walking all the time thats all people are doing
7262743 clearly if youre engaged in texting that requires concentration its very difficult to do another task especially walking in a big city
7262744 with time were knocking out our visual and audio cues that are grounding us in our environment
7262745 initially malware was created to wreak havoc and cause disruption for purposes of notoriety but over time it has evolved into a stealthy malicious threat leveraged by criminals for financial gain
7262746 as a result of this paradigm shift there are currently tens of thousands of live web sites that misuse brands and trademarks for purposes of malware distribution cyveillance stays ahead of the curve by taking an intelligence led approach to security proactively monitoring and identifying specific instances of online brand abuse
7262747 there are reports about my health which have worried the believers these are incorrect
7262748 i have lived in najaf for more than 50 years from before saddam during the royalty and also after that i have seen the courage of the sons of najaf and i pray for the best for you
7262749 im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the line workers folks whose lives are the measure of whether the american dream endures
7262750 telling the truth is more important than making you feel good
7262751 hes so qualified so impressive too bad he cant win maybe he should be secretary of state
7262752 joes out there hugging and kissing people he just keeps going
7262753 you know the american people could care less about whats going on up here
7262754 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7262755 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7262756 im a seasoned guy and i really feel completely at ease
7262757 uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7262758 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7262759 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7262760 i say with every fiber in my being we cannot stand four more years of this
7262761 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7262762 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7262763 if it were a race between sen mccain and sen biden it would be a very different race
7262764 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of world
7262765 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7262766 there has never been a year like 1968 and it is unlikely there will ever be again
7262767 people were rebelling over disparate issues and had in common only the desire to rebel and a sense of alienation from the established order
7262768 the draft had a way of focusing the mind of a young person
7262769 it was not just that you were fighting for an abstract cause you were fighting for something all too real
7262770 now theyve taken dr king off its time to end this non violence bulls
7262771 some people look at things the way they are and ask why i dream of things that never were and ask why not
7262772 many who had turned one last time to the political process abandoned it
7262773 geographically i had a front row seat but i was slack jawed a lot of the time
7262774 with each escalation the world comes closer to cosmic disaster the only rational way out is to negotiate not as victors but as honourable people
7262775 hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today
7262776 a whole system of order authority and tradition was swept aside
7262777 she loves the surreal look sound and score and the soundtrack and score will be a theme running throughout the record
7262778 tourists especially americans who came to see where the film was shot were always disappointed when they heard the pub didnt actually exist in real life
7262779 now they will be able to have a drink just like john wayne did in the film or browse the souvenirs
7262780 we have come from the light and to the light we shall return
7262781 this is the part where i take requests what would you like me to play
7262782 im not singing that im in charge i choose the songs
7262783 i think the audience was a bit quiet there was no drive from the crowd
7262784 it should have been more of a stand out performance seeing as it was her first night
7262785 i expected her to say thank you to us considering we came along for the opening night
7262786 madonna was absolutely fantastic but the cardiff crowd completely let her down
7262787 we enjoyed it to the max though and madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7262788 i think the fans who have been grumbling about the show are the older ones who arent as keen to get into the new songs
7262789 i thought it was amazing she has such a lot of energy
7262790 it was a very diverse show with lots of different things going on
7262791 it started fun and light hearted but then there was the heavy political moment followed by 4 minutes when she says theres only four minutes to save the world which was brilliant
7262792 bombardemanget varit mycket omfattande m nga hus har totaltf rst rts och fler n 90 icke stridande personer har d dats de flesta av dem kvinnor och barn
7262793 if we look back at the last races weve seen similar pit exits where stewards havent taken action
7262794 sutil kept his line and didnt lose time so i would be very surprised if we are penalised but lets wait and see what the stewards decide
7262795 the system is not automatic the lights are controlled by human beings
7262796 maybe kimi started a bit earlier while the nozzle was still locked in and the guy came with that
7262797 that he desires peace and that syria is a factor of stability and not a threat it is a country that knows what it wants and goes for it
7262798 the key now is can we back up and therell be many who would suggest we cant
7262799 the history would suggest that also but well get a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7262800 we know that we have to better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up because its something that we havent done
7262801 i think its a reflection on how much they guys gave to secure that victory and then also that our feet hopefully are planted on the ground
7262802 we know that this is a two match tour and were very happy with what we achieved and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7262803 its been commented on before the fact that with so many guys that havent got that baggage with us i think that helps
7262804 its easy sometimes when youre sitting behind the glass a long way away with a pen not to have any real sense of the games physicality
7262805 i think sometimes looking through the tv screen and looking from a distance we dont have a sense of that the boys got up and met that reality
7262806 the victim believed to be aged 18 years was taken by london ambulance to whipps cross hospital he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival
7262807 the upper time limit for abortion should be reduced from 24 weeks because foetuses can feel pain before that time a scientist told mps last night professor sunny anand from the university of arkansas was invited to the commons to present evidence that the part of the brain which can feel pain develops at around 20 weeks he said it was very likely that foetuses aborted beyond that stage of pregnancy could feel excruciating pain

7262819 making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
7262820 sporting a patriotic tie frankfort township assessor paul ruff launched his bid for re election as he charged that recent controversy over an e mail he forwarded was
7262821 as i have done thousands of times i forwarded the message on my private e mail account to people i know
7262822 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this county and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes
7262823 it was not done with any malicious intent but unfortunately some people have attempted to make it a political issue
7262824 maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves american citizens will find the backbone to start speaking and voicing the same truths
7262825 it really really makes me mad when a newspaper calls me a racist

7262840 chicago based boeing corporation prime contractor for the u s ground based missile defense system will supply the rockets to be placed in poland but the army corps of engineers will manage construction of the site

7262842 waltham massachusetts based raytheon corporation built the powerful x band radar now based in the kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands which will be moved to the czech republic

7262931 is not working as well as the public may think
7262932 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
7262933 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
7262934 we think that the minimum drinking age law has been incredibly effective at saving lives and we think it should stay just where it is
7262935 we know from previous experience that when the drinking age was lower in the 1970s that deaths among 18 to 20 year olds in traffic fatalities went up by about 800 a year we also know that when the age was raised in the 1980s the opposite occurred deaths went down
7262936 as a mother of two young men who would be directly affected by a change my gut reaction is to keep the drinking age at 21
7262937 a change would give colleges the opportunity to provide safe and monitored environments and promote responsible drinking
7262938 lowering the drinking age to 18 might help with the problems associated when kids going away to college such as binge drinking
7262939 still i would vote against lowering the age because id be more concerned about high school 18 year olds purchasing alcohol for younger students
7262940 having said this i know for a fact that our kids drank before the age of 21 with one exception it was never abused and the fact is that they had to go to great lengths to keep it from us
7262941 i think binge drinking stems from two issues lack of information and lack of self respect plus a person can be uninformed and unconcerned about their health at any age so i dont really think the drinking age is an issue id have a drinking age abolished altogether if it were up to me
7262942 what we need are parents willing to introduce kids to alcohol the way they are introduced to cars slowly and with a lot of caution and guidance
7262943 if we can send people to war at that age who are we to say they cant drink

7262956 he adds balance with his international relations experience and his depth in defense issues
7262957 i think that obama and biden will be better on domestic issues
7262958 but im worried about the foreign policy issues and i dont see them as any different maybe a little slower to bomb but i dont see any fundamental changes
7262959 the more i thought about it the more pleased i became
7262960 because of his background and his ability to reach out to rural ohio rural pennsylvania michigan the perennially targeted states biden helps as an old style democratic establishment guy
7262961 of all the names that were being bantered about biden has the best foreign policy experience which many people including myself think is important

7262965 if we can shut off the infiltration and inflow we dont have to collect it treat it or dispose of it the savings could be substantial
7262966 its an unpopular option particularly with the real estate community but it doesnt do us much good if we only deal with the public stuff while most of the problem extra water is coming from the private arena

7262996 i rarely pack more than one book by the same author unless im on a real jag
7262997 for my part i had scrupulously avoided getting in touch with my feelings about all this but it had still gradually evolved from the worst fishing horror story id ever heard with the happiest probable ending to a lesson in impermanence to the ultimate in fishermans luck since in an entire season there was that one week of good fishing and id been there for it
7262998 we must intensify our work to win membership in the european security system and strengthen the defence capabilities of our country

7263034 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7263035 were not going to let russia so soon after the iron curtain fell to again draw a dividing line across europe
7263036 the g8 should become for a while the g7 until russia proves that it is capable of being a law abiding member of the international community
7263037 the russians are hell bent on recapturing some of the territory that they believe is rightfully theirs that now is in the hands of people indigenous to the area who are embracing freedom and democracy

7263047 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7263048 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7263049 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7263050 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7263051 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7263052 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7263053 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7263054 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7263055 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is

7263066 the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer
7263067 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7263068 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7263069 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7263070 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7263071 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7263072 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7263073 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7263074 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7263075 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7263076 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7263077 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7263078 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7263079 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7263080 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

7263091 but you cant question my commitment to football how i approach the game ive never had that question i am shocked to the fullest
7263092 if you think a guy is doing too much wouldnt you talk to him about it

7263114 the upshot of lambeth is that the americans are going to continue ordaining homosexuals and celebrating same sex blessings and the conservative foreign anglican prelates will continue trespassing into american episcopal dioceses on behalf of beleaguered conservatives nothing really changed
7263115 has again convinced me that the anglican communion cannot hold in tension convictions and practices that are incompatible and so not patent of reconciliation without continuing seriously to damage the life and witness of anglican churches as much in the global south as in north america and in other provinces that have followed the lead of the episcopal church
7263116 i cannot see that the members of an international family of churches can thrive and grow and offer a clear witness to jesus christ as lord while offering contradictory teaching on a matter as central as the character of the holy life in different parts of a world knit together by instantaneous e communications
7263117 with whole parishes and dioceses deserting the national church amid such widespread heterodoxy and scandal followed by a wave of litigation and squabbling over property it s impossible to see the episcopal church as anything other than a disaster area

7263134 we were interested in whether there was going to be different filtering policies for those in the media center and other places in beijing and other places in china the answer seems to be no and thats interesting
7263135 i dont know how they decide to choose one versus another
7263136 we also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice providers consistent with federal policy may block transmissions of illegal content e g child pornography or transmissions that violate copyright law to the extent however that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong
7263137 considers whether the network management practice is intended to distinguish between legal and illegal activity the commissions network principles only recognize and protect users access to legal content the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright is not protected by our principles similarly applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected

7263213 i follow your column and have noticed how many times mountain lions have been sighted
7263214 take this for what it is worth last thursday as my kerry blue terrier and i were traveling down huse road in manchester just about 30 or so feet from the powerlines we saw a lion cross the road it took about two strides for him or her to get to the other side
7263215 ive seen the lions in zoos etc and i am convinced that is what i saw
7263216 in so many years of service in the railways i have never come across such a bizarre incident
7263217 as the world moves towards the 21st century what do you think will happen to india will it sprint into the 21st century or remain where it is in the 20th century
7263218 i think india will do neither we will find ourselves dragged into the 21st century and we will just slide in there without knowing
7263219 in order to rendezvous with and land upon an asteroid whose size and shape are still unknown hayabusa will need highly developed navigation guidance and control systems to this end hayabusa employs an optical navigation camera onc a light detection and ranging lidar a laser range finder lrf and fan beam sensors fbs whose combined use enables it to safely approach and land on the asteroid in order to successfully descend on a candidate landing point it not only uses an artificial target called target marker that is released from the spacecraft to the surface but also adjusts its position by processing the images sent from the camera
7263220 oh no the foam fell off again and broke the tiles
7263221 we are approaching to the asteroid itokawa for the next touch down which will be held on 26th in the morning jst
7263222 while data processings is being done it is best to look at a beautiful autumn picture of the jaxa headquarters
7263223 hey why dont we have a team building exercise of all employees hanging off a cliff and helping each other to get back on the ground
7263224 the function of genius is not to give new answers but to pose new questions which time and mediocrity can solve
7263225 a lot of people think maths was a western invention
7263226 this programme is about how a lot of things were done here in india before they were discovered in the west so the programme is in fact quite political because it shows how much we have ignored discoveries in the east
7263227 its been fantastic filming in india as the visual backdrop is so rich
7263228 one of the biggest inventions in india was the number zero indians used it long before the west did
7263229 when the west had roman numerals there was no zero and that is why they were so clumsy on the other hand brahmagupta was one of the key mathematicians in the world because he invented the idea of zero
7263230 we learn that newton invented the mathematical theory calculus in the 17th century but madhava created it earlier
7263231 he developed a lot of his own maths he contacted english mathematician g h hardy who persuaded him to come to cambridge they began a collaboration between the analytical maths of the west and the intuitive maths of india and together produced brilliant theories and amazing results
7263232 he had to almost give up his religion but maths was also like a religion to him he had no one to talk to in india because at that time no one was interested in his ideas
7263233 nee meneer smile ik weet het dat gaat me geld kosten he
7263234 this is going to be a major change no matter how it comes out
7263235 the fact of an african american winning a major partys nomination is unprecedented its a difficult position to be in but so far hes been treading very carefully and i think successfully
7263236 i dont think i know he wants to be elected because hes a good president who happens to be black not because hes black and would like to be president
7263237 after a primary like this theres always more time needed to unify the party
7263238 but obamas going to win the nomination and hes going to make a hell of a speech
7263239 when i hear obama talking about change and a new direction it brings back to me some parallels
7263240 it was part of this whole momentum of moving forward of moving beyond
7263241 i think he has a very tough campaign ahead of him because a lot of ideas about race are very subliminal
7263242 what will they do when they get in the voting booth i dont think anybody really knows yet
7263243 theirs is going to be about history and ours is going to be about the future
7263244 obamas biggest problem is to recapture the excitement about the time he was in minneapolis in february when he was coming on strong
7263245 i think hes better off to just hammer on issues people really do care about it like jobs and the economy
7263246 in the end voters and black voters are more focused on making sure that someone who has their best interests in mind will win rather than voting for the first black president
7263247 people ask me all the time dont you feel guilty for it and i say thats ridiculous
7263248 it seems reasonable and rational to control the tv from where you normally sit and watch television
7263249 he was part of a project that changed the world
7263250 he was a man who would dream in the night and wake up and say i just solved a problem he was always thinking science

7263252 wheres mrs taylor ohhh i remember i miss her already
7263253 i like the movie because when figaro was sitting in the chair then he was fall asleep when rosina was singing a song i dont like that much because when they talk i dont know what they are say but i do know what they are say but just little bit and i will give 3 stars
7263254 i think it was to long because it is a movie about singing because they are to loud because my friends fell asleep
7263255 i like it because i liked the singing and count almaviva loves rosina and they got married my friends wont like it because of the singing is different
7263256 i like it because it is not borning and i like when rosina and count almaviva got married
7263257 i like how they dress i think they dont look funny
7263258 i think my friends will like it and i give it five stars
7263259 i thought the costumes were great the play was great
7263260 the only part i saw was when was figaro started to shave dr b thats the part i saw i think my friends will like this movie
7263261 i dont like the movie cause i dont understand it i like the costumes
7263262 anything that could possibly happen is talked about in the advance plan
7263263 its good to see that the space is here there could be nothing but its just a crumb

7263277 many many years ago when i was studying in boston
7263278 i lost so much money those crooks on wall street took us all for such a ride with the dot com companies
7263279 what what who is not paying me who got on thieves you are all thieves
7263280 now look at what you have done the blind fool thinks we are cheating him what are we going to do if he takes us all to the police station we dont even have tickets to prove we have paid it is his word against ours and these arabs love to put us all in jail for no reason at all anyway
7263281 what do you mean what i did i did not do anything i just wished the idiot would shut up i have been on this bus for an hour and the damn fool is screaming it every minute
7263282 cant you see he is blind you moron he does not know who gets on and who gets off what else can he do but hope people come by and pay him take some pity on an old guy and dont think of yourself all the time
7263283 i know he cannot see but we have not stopped anywhere for the last fifteen minutes and he has yelled many many money money a hundred times already i just wished he would shut up until we got to a bus stop at least then let him yell all he wants

7263292 as recently as may premier said the problem was not of its making but stemmed from anti virus software that ohio had installed on its machines
7263293 unlike other software the problem acknowledged by premier cannot be fixed by sending out a coding fix to its customers because of federal rules for certifying election systems rigall chris riggall a spokesman for premier election solutions said changes to systems must go through the election assistance commission he said and take two years on average for certification and approval and that is apart from whatever approvals and reviews would be needed by each elections board throughout the country

7263312 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7263313 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7263314 of course there are political motivations and i support that a media outlet should not adopt one particular political line
7263315 venevisi n and televen for economic reasons realizing that ch vez will be around for a long time re accommodated their political line after the coup rctv and globovisi n didnt they forgot that their existence depends on ch vez i am sure that when the globovisi n concession expires ch vez will not renew it we can say that right now unless of course they try to moderate their tone which would make them look rather ridiculous essentially those that collaborate with the government project will be left in peace that can be said about media outlets as much as landowners or other actors

7263342 gradually the complementary design phase and its building will begin
7263343 the site has been chosen and the preparation process is under way
7263344 whats important is that democrats should cease trying to pass a compromise budget when the people theyre negotiating with obviously have no intention of compromising they should instead focus their efforts on convincing californians that the reason theyre refusing to capitulate is to protect and defend the interests of the states residents
7263345 california is the last state in the nation on a july fiscal calendar to enact a budget
7263346 the state budget is past due so why are lawmakers spending time raising big bucks from donors
7263347 all the lawmakers republican and democrat alike should be tossed out
7263348 california must stand for something education needs to be a priority
7263349 i think its a 50 50 chance this could go into september

7263359 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7263360 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7263361 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7263362 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7263363 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7263364 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7263365 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7263366 we had a concern that this was going to happen

7263406 other ministers could spend time on their portfolio areas rather than preparing for questions they will not be asked

7263416 betrays the australian peoples right to an open and transparent parliament
7263417 the current way in which question time functions circumvents parliaments only means by which corruption mismanagement or errors by executive government can be exposed all this undermines the objective of question time and betrays the australian peoples right to an open and transparent parliament
7263418 if a minister for transport were asked whether or not he or she had taken a million dollar bribe from a shipping company the answer would be ruled relevant if it were about shipping
7263419 the main benefit of such an innovation would be that greater interrogation of ministers could occur with the effect of improving the accountability mechanism of the house of representatives

7263453 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is

7263456 some bullying and brazen countries and their worthless followers wanted to impose their will on the iranian nation but the president and the government have stood up to their excessive demands and moved forward
7263457 pursuing an aggressive spirit toward world bullies is a manifestation of the governments loyalty to revolutionary slogans and discourse
7263458 we cant be satisfied with the way the country is being administered a country with abundant resources should not have gas cuts in winter and electricity cuts in summer or have people spending hours in line at gas stations

7263477 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7263478 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7263479 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games

7263492 there can be no new truth which would not be found in the word
7263493 the scriptures are the only rule or standard of faith and practice
7263494 very dear sister i hear that some of the sisters have had dreams about the coming of jesus this has given me uneasiness for although absent in body i am with you in spirit desiring and seeking the good of all of you the dear redeemed ones of our precious saviour it is by the word of god our rule and our light in these last days that we must abide i do not pretend to say that god may not give warning by a dream for the word of god says that he can do so but we must be much upon our guard we have no need of a dream with respect to matters revealed by god you will generally find that sisters are the ones who have seen these things and i have not moreover noticed that it has brought them or others nearer to god so i beg these sisters to weigh these things well and not to allow themselves readily to put faith in these dreams as if they came from god let them not allow themselves to be carried away by their imagination lest they should fall into the snare of the enemy and lest he should take advantage of this to shake the faith of some
7263495 you will generally find that sisters are the ones who have seen these things
7263496 i do not accept a womans going out to evangelize i never saw a woman meddle in teaching and church matters but she brought mischief upon herself and everyone else if she sits down with a company before her to teach them she has got out of her place altogether
7263497 a woman cannot be a principle agent in the work it is contrary to the ways of god she may help greatly help but not be the principle agent

7263500 the excitement was great so that though not particularly an excitable person he felt its effects very strongly
7263501 dont go the best part is probably to come yet
7263502 it may be added without of course saying anything that could point out the persons that female vanity and very distinct worldliness did not confirm to his mind the thought that it could be the spirits power the md s were in ordinary life quiet sober men and he believes most blameless their names were so public that there is no indelicacy in alluding to them
7263503 the people called irvingites have been plainly convicted elsewhere of so much false doctrine false practice and false prophecy and that by many of the church of god as to make it when known a question only of preserving gods children against the deceits and crafts of satan
7263504 now this was so plainly wicked and evil and contrary to gods word and spirit that they have since they have been pressed with it taken great pains at least the subtler ones among them to disclaim and deny this i say the subtler ones because it has been not long since avowed by some of their teachers to the writer of this the way they have gotten over the spirits having sanctioned it is that they were not answerable for what was said that is in utterance by the spirit before the ordinances were set up one of these very ordinances said to the writer of this that the spirit might have said it through prejudice to please me irving i only mention this to shew the unhappy degradation to which men may be reduced by giving way to the leadings of an evil spirit
7263505 it may not be generally known that the gifts among the irvingites were founded on this doctrine of christ being a sinner in nature like ourselves mr irvings statement was that he had long preached the gifts but there was nothing for the holy ghost to testify to but when he preached this doctrine they came as a witness to it his teaching moreover on the subject was confirmed by what was received as the prophetic power amongst them
7263506 it was a glorious light above the brightness of the sun that shone round about me i felt that those who were filled with the spirit could see spiritual things and feel walking in the midst of them while those who had not the spirit could see nothing so that two shall be in one bed the one taken and the other left because the one has the light of god within while the other cannot see the kingdom of heaven i saw the people of god in an awfully dangerous situation surrounded by nets and entanglements about to be tried and many about to be deceived and fall now will the wicked be revealed with all power and signs and lying wonders so that if it were possible the very elect will be deceived this is the fiery trial which is to try us it will be for the purging and purifying of the real members of the body of jesus but oh it will be a fiery trial every soul will be shaken to the very center the enemy will try to shake in every thing we have believed but the trial of real faith will be found to honor and praise and glory nothing but what is of god will stand the stony ground hearers will be made manifest the love of many will wax cold i frequently said that night and often since now shall the awful sight of a false christ be seen on this earth and nothing but the living christ in us can detect this awful attempt of the enemy to deceive or it is with all deceivableness of unrighteousness he will work he will have a counter part for every part of gods truth and an imitation for every work of the spirit the spirit must and will be poured out on the church that she may be purified and filled with god and just in proportion as the spirit of god works so will he when our lord anoints men with power so will he this is particularly the nature of the trial through which those are to pass who will be counted worthy to stand before the son of man there will be outward trial too but tis principally temptation it is brought on by the outpouring of the spirit and will just increase in proportion as the spirit is poured out the trial of the church is from antichrist it is by being filled with the spirit that we shall be kept
7263507 the restoration of apostles and prophets in the catholic apostolic church
7263508 i hold and i can add that we firmly hold all the foundations of the christian faith the divinity of the father of the son and of the holy ghost one god eternally blessed the divinity and humanity of the lord jesus two natures in one person his resurrection and his glorification at the right hand of god the presence of the holy ghost here below having descended on the day of pentecost the return of the lord jesus according to his promise
7263509 other truths are connected with these such as the miraculous birth of the saviour who was absolutely without sin and yet others but you will readily understand sir that my object is not to give a course of lectures or a theological summary but to make it quite clear that it is in nowise on the giving up of the great foundations of the christian faith that our position is based
7263510 the federal government should stop trying to do everything which it doesnt do well and start doing and doing better the few tasks that only it can handle
7263511 for instance uncle sam has become a nanny state telling us what we can eat and how old we must be to drink more than 100 university presidents have called on washington to reduce the drinking age of 21 maybe they are right and maybe they are wrong but this isnt a job for congress it should be the decision of the 50 states which have very different histories traditions and views of such issues
7263512 republican senator john warner wants to revive the national 55 mph limit but why should politicians in washington decide how fast people can drive in butte montana chicago illinois decatur georgia and lubbock texas the respective limits should depend on local conditions and are questions for the states and local communities
7263513 today the national government seeks to run every school system in america
7263514 washington has nationalized much of the welfare system congress funds everything from left turn lanes to bridges to nowhere across the country it makes no sense to tax all americans ship their money to washington deduct a big handling charge and then have legislators and administrators hand it back with lots of strings attached
7263515 unfortunately both senators john mccain and barack obama believe in an all powerful federal government while they and other members of congress act like city councilmen and state legislators they are failing to deal with national problems
7263516 the deficit next year will run a half trillion dollars the occupation of iraq continues to drag on social security and medicare are heading towards financial disaster the federal government is filled with waste our liberties and privacy are under attack but congressmen and presidents prefer to spend their time on local matters that should be decided by local people
7263517 even if politicians in washington were competent to manage local affairs that wouldnt be their job
7263518 they dont know what is best for local communities at the same time theyve made a mess of the issues that are their constitutional responsibility only by looking beyond the republicans and democrats to bob barr and the libertarian party will we get real change in america

7263609 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7263610 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors

7263618 we believe that the german investigation ceased because of a lack of co operation from south africa and we suspect that the british investigation may likewise also be ended due to a singular lack of assistance from the government
7263619 if this is untrue we challenge the minister of justice to refute this allegation by providing the public with substantive evidence that south africa is co operating fully with the british authorities
7263620 by accessing the mlas we would be able to hold government to account in terms of whether it assisted the german and british investigations
7263621 it is essential that our government co operates fully with the investigations and ensures that any south africans who benefited unlawfully from the billions of rands spent on the arms deal are publicly held to account
7263622 disclosure of the copy of the request as well as other documents which accompanied the said request will in my view prejudice the good international relationship that the republic of south africa has with the united kingdom
7263623 government has repeatedly stated that there were no irregularities in respect of the arms deal yet they continue to obstruct and prevent access to relevant documents
7263624 if there are no irregularities then government should have no reason to prevent those documents from being scrutinized and no reason to believe that the disclosure of any information in these documents would prejudice its reputation

7263627 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their wellbeing is our top priority we certainly hope they return in the near future
7263628 what kind of voice are you giving a candidate when they are allowed to write whatever they choose unsigned
7263629 its not illegal i dont think but its certainly unethical
7263630 i wasnt sure if they would edit or add to it or what
7263631 my understanding from an operational standpoint is he was a correspondent
7263632 well treat it just like other submissions we reserve the right to edit its not an issue with me

7263635 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7263636 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7263637 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7263638 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7263639 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7263640 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7263641 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7263642 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7263643 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7263644 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7263645 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7263646 the skull of st john the baptist was originally in the possession of the byzantine and fell into ottoman hands after the conquest this relic was presented by mehmed ii 1451 81 to mara despena daughter of the serbean king subsequently it became the property of cezayioli hasan pasa and after his death brought to the palace around 1790
7263647 the right arm of st john the baptist and its case belonged to the byzantine prior to the conquest in 1484 bayezed ii 1481 1512 sent it as a gift to the knights of rhodes it was later discovered in lefkose castle in cyprus and brought back to istanbul in 1585

7263653 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7263654 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7263655 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7263656 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7263657 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7263658 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7263659 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7263660 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7263661 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7263662 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7263663 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7263664 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7263665 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7263666 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7263667 la gente va a ir eligiendo formatos m s abiertos por el simple hecho de que en la medida en que lo hagan contribuir n a que bajen los precios es un problema de educaci n

7263671 this is for my 78 year old lifelong democrat father who has already booked his ticket to fly out here in hopes of getting in

7263673 i called all the people i knew in middle tennessee politics
7263674 no one had tickets they were sort of left out
7263675 i have worked for him so i put a little pressure there
7263676 i kept calling and they said no were blocked off for dnc week
7263677 i talked to a friend of mine who was a really good buddy of al gores and he said he was going to try to get me some way to get in the convention during the week
7263678 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7263679 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7263680 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7263681 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7263682 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7263683 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7263684 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7263685 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7263686 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7263687 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7263688 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7263689 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7263690 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7263691 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7263692 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7263693 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7263694 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7263695 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7263696 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7263697 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7263698 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7263699 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7263700 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7263701 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7263702 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7263703 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7263704 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7263705 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7263706 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7263707 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7263708 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7263709 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7263710 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7263711 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7263712 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7263713 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7263714 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7263715 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7263716 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7263717 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7263718 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7263719 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7263720 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7263721 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7263722 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7263723 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7263724 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7263725 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7263726 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7263727 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7263728 by gods grace i am fine and so is shahid except for a few cuts and bruises
7263729 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7263730 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7263731 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7263732 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person
7263733 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7263734 swim with the current in matters of principle stand like a rock

7263737 its two kilograms per seat and 500 seats a worthwhile saving
7263738 we are doing it because of fuel prices and the environment the printed matter will be replaced by content shown on the aircrafts seatback tvs
7263739 people are smarter today theyre bombarded with media and they know pr when they see it
7263740 the quality of onboard media has shot up in recent years and the best magazines represent an emotional link between the passenger and the airline thats achieved through beautiful design and great writing
7263741 in the late 1980s japan airlines actually removed seats from certain planes as its inflight magazines were 300 odd pages in length and it was a simple case of ticket sales versus ad page rates
7263742 some ideas never die because they are sound western sydney needs better transport links a high speed link to penrith ought to be part of the answer to sydneys beleaguered transport system any government worth a candle would examine that need regardless of whether we have a cracker of an idea or not
7263743 a conspiracy by labor mates against the public to get some hair brained idea up
7263744 we have played by the book and deserve a fair assessment
7263745 a bunch of guys are persistently pitching an idea to government and some in government agree and others dont whats so unusual or sinister about that
7263746 government representatives said that with the concentration on metro projects wfr had fallen through the cracks and that we were entitled to feel aggrieved we were then promised a review of our costings this is our complaint despite spending 6 million on the project to date we havent as yet received any meaningful feedback sadly this is government in nsw which is the real wfr story
7263747 it is also worth mentioning leighton contractors have offered if selected to underwrite costs on an agreed route
7263748 this is a watertight transfer of risk to the private sector
7263749 wfr has only ever wanted a fair robust assessment we soldier on because we are not giving in until that happens

7263751 but the old people will give away their food to see children eat
7263752 its probably triple what we pay for our stock its a joke
7263753 you often see the old people get worked up because they dont have the money to pay for it food
7263754 ive got the resources to get in my ute and go to halls creek to stock up
7263755 det finns ingen plats f r tintin i ett demokratiskt samh lle
7263756 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7263757 we were still very low very close to the ground
7263758 i saw the watch was not his nor the t shirt
7263759 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7263760 we gave priority to security and to improve administration levels here in kandahar
7263761 we also talked about improvement of the official administration hire capable men for certain departments that they could be able to run the offices with good understanding have mutual understanding with common people
7263762 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7263763 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7263764 promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
7263765 foster democracy improve human rights and integrate china with the rest of the world
7263766 by allowing beijing to host the games you will help in the development of human rights
7263767 that the olympic games will improve human rights in china
7263768 we believe that the olympic games will have definitely a positive lasting effect on chinese society
7263769 gao chuancai a farmer from northeast china who was hoping to publicize government corruption was forcibly escorted back to his hometown and remains in custody
7263770 two rights advocates from southern china have not been heard from since they were seized last week at the public security bureaus protest application office in beijing

7263775 wir sind schlau genug und nicht so naiv zu glauben dass die aktuelle tabelle die realit t widerspiegelt
7263776 die mannschaft hat verinnerlicht warum wir schon in der r ckrunde der zweiten liga so stark geworden sind
7263777 es sind ja gerade einmal zwei spieltage geschafft aber wir wollen uns immer verbessern
7263778 wenn es irgendwo auf dem markt einen spieler gibt von dem wir der meinung sind dass er zu uns passt haben wir immer die m glichkeit ihn zu holen
7263779 i wanted to give the spectators a wonderful show but i did not expect that my opponent would get injured
7263780 before the olympic games i was just a normal athlete but now i am a gold medalist i was perfect today and did very well psychologically and physically throughout the games i fought with 100 per cent of my skills i put myself in a low position and tried my best to fight against my opponent
7263781 wir brauchen sie auch nicht wir wollen eine gro e party feiern

7263787 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7263788 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7263789 we werent supposed to have any tornado warnings flooding or wind but basically weve had all three in southwest georgia
7263790 well have statistics on how well everything worked later but calls did go out
7263791 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7263792 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7263793 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7263794 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7263795 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7263796 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7263797 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7263798 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7263799 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7263800 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7263801 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7263802 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7263803 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7263804 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7263805 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7263806 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7263807 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7263808 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7263809 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7263810 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7263811 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7263812 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7263813 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7263814 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7263815 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7263816 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7263817 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7263818 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7263819 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7263820 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7263821 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7263822 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7263823 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7263824 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7263825 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7263826 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7263827 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7263828 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7263829 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7263830 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7263831 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7263832 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7263833 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7263834 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7263835 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7263836 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7263837 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7263838 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7263839 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7263840 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7263841 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7263842 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7263843 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7263844 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7263845 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7263846 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7263847 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7263848 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7263849 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7263850 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7263851 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7263852 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7263853 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7263854 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7263855 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7263856 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7263857 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7263858 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7263859 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7263860 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7263861 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7263862 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7263863 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7263864 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7263865 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7263866 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7263867 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7263868 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7263869 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7263870 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7263871 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7263872 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7263873 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7263874 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7263875 were trying to hold the line against the invasion of the douglas fir
7263876 this is the most outstanding example of white oak distribution pretty much anywhere
7263877 in the absence of management this would have been a closed canopy douglas fir forest
7263878 that park is full of dead fuel and dead fuels ignite more easily than live fuels
7263879 our concern was that many of these oak woodlands were going to be converted to be douglas fir forests
7263880 are probably the most important california landscape as far as biodiversity is concerned
7263881 but when were dealing with ecological systems i think we have to take a long view what do want it to look like when our grandchildren use it and if we let it go to douglas fir it wont be much of a park for them
7263882 our field records will be perhaps the most valuable of all our results you cant tell in advance which observations will prove valuable do record them all
7263883 climate is the culprit i dont think there is any iota of reason not to think that
7263884 eventually its going to get shoved off these mountains and go extinct
7263885 animals that are relatively static have a much more limited ability to move if climate changes faster than they can find new habitat theyre out of business
7263886 wed be sitting in camp and wed both be skinning pretty soon hed throw a rat over to me and hed say here russell finish this one up and hed just pick up his notebook and start writing
7263887 we never traveled one inch but what he had that notebook open and writing notes
7263888 have just heard the loud hard clattering call of a belted kingfisher as i sat down four deer were walking about the doe has now just gotten excited and given eight rather loud snorts in irregular succession
7263889 at 7 000 feet heard a very loud pounding i followed the racket and came across a pileated woodpecker
7263890 the beauty of the field notes is they describe in great detail where grinnell was camping and where he set his trap lines
7263891 we can often go to the exact same place and see whats there now
7263892 historic records for yosemite indicate theres been about a five degree fahrenheit increase in the maximum summer temperature for any given elevation
7263893 now if you happen to see one you consider yourself pretty lucky
7263894 if you read their notes they saw it every day
7263895 were never going to learn about the biology of the animal here in yosemite because we cant find them
7263896 when we got here it was like somebody put a battery in him
7263897 he just goes and then stops and waits for everybody else
7263898 he knows more about these squirrels and chipmunks than anybody else in the world period
7263899 they think i must be writing a paper or i have a degree
7263900 but its just sheer curiosity every year i see something that will catch my interest and i try to learn a little more about it
7263901 for the past quite a few years i have not seen a one
7263902 you could sit quietly and picas would come out and carry on their activities all around you
7263903 this afternoon i noted some alpine chipmunks feasting on a sandwich i had thrown out
7263904 it involves changing rainfall patterns changes in the timing and deposition in the amount of snow
7263905 we know chipmunks feed a lot on seeds if we have a change in the pattern of snow deposition theres a good likelihood well see changes in the distribution of plants
7263906 if that happens the plants they rely on may go away
7263907 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7263908 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7263909 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7263910 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7263911 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7263912 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7263913 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7263914 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7263915 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7263916 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7263917 the romans had to dedicate every year for five years at least 19 8 square kilometers to grow wheat and 35 3 square kilometers or almost the area of the island of manhatten and to capture the solar energy needed to extract move carve and hoist the single keystone they needed nearly 1 300 suqare metres of farmland
7263918 the roman empire was locked into a food based energy system as the empire expanded and matured as it exploited and in some cases exhausted the mediterranean regions best cropland and then moved on to cultivate poorer lands and as its grain supply lines snaked farther and farther from its major cities it had to work harder and harder to produce each additional ton of grain
7263919 romes control of its frontier territories disintegrated and many were abandoned travel and trade became unsafe and literacy and recordkeeping plummeted commerce declined although tax revenues were static or declining government costs continued to go up as emperors tried to secure their power by expanding the dole increasing the size of the army boosting soldiers pay and holding more games and spectacles
7263920 complex and harsh measures to extract more energy from the land
7263921 by the 5th century in the west the empire was literally burning through its capital its productive farmland and its peasantry peasants deserted their lands so power and wealth were increasingly concentrated in the hands of large landowners who then used their influence to evade taxes as state finances deteriorated public services like roads bridges aqueducts and the postal service broke down
7263922 first we must reduce as much as we can the force of the underlying tectonic stresses in order to lower the risk of synchronous failure that is of catastrophic collapse that cascades across boundaries between technological social and ecological systems second we need to cultivate a prospective mind so we can cope better with surprise third we must boost the overall resilience of critical systems like our energy and food supply networks and fourth we need to prepare to turn breakdown to our advantage when it happens
7263923 reflected on alternative value systems that could help us achieve different futures our values must be compatible with the exigencies of the natural world we live in and depend on they must implicitly recognize the laws of thermodynamics energys role in our survival the dangers of certain kinds of connectivity and the nonlinear behaviour of natural systems like climate the endless material growth of our economies in fundamentally inconsistent with these physical facts of life
7263924 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7263925 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7263926 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7263927 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7263928 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7263929 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7263930 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7263931 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7263932 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7263933 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7263934 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7263935 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7263936 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7263937 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7263938 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7263939 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7263940 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7263941 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7263942 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7263943 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7263944 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7263945 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7263946 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7263947 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7263948 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7263949 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7263950 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7263951 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7263952 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7263953 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7263954 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7263955 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7263956 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7263957 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7263958 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7263959 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7263960 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7263961 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7263962 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7263963 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7263964 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7263965 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7263966 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7263967 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7263968 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7263969 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7263970 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7263971 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7263972 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7263973 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7263974 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7263975 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7263976 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7263977 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7263978 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7263979 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7263980 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7263981 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7263982 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7263983 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7263984 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7263985 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7263986 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7263987 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7263988 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7263989 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7263990 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7263991 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7263992 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7263993 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7263994 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7263995 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7263996 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7263997 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton

7264007 tobacco accounts for 30 per cent of my business it brings in customers who then buy other things children will still buy tobacco if it is under the counter or they will go to the smugglers
7264008 the time change was really tough we were waking up at 5 a m every day and we tried to stay up
7264009 we had a good run our first few matches we played very well and got confidence we just played hard and came out with the title and we feel really good
7264010 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends the world over who have been involved in the beijing olympic games in various ways
7264011 the most intangible legacy but also very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world
7264012 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7264013 a grand event of international sports competition and cultural exchanges
7264014 the chinese people have greeted all the guests with great enthusiasm and shared with people from across the world the joy and happiness
7264015 the success of the beijing olympic games is attributable to the concerted efforts of the chinese people and people from the rest of the world
7264016 thanks to the efforts by the villages service team we have received 49 compliment letters and no complaints

7264021 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

7264024 dac ma njuri pe blog la tine nu comenta pe blog la mine
7264025 die branche und die besucher unterst tzen uns eindeutig darin die messe in leipzig fortzuf hren
7264026 wir werden das in der kommenden woche in ruhe besprechen
7264027 little wolf little wolf im going to eat your house
7264028 i dont like the variety of books and theyre really small
7264029 the branches dont have the specialized resources the reference resources
7264030 main librarys holdings are 10 times larger than any neighborhood librarys holdings
7264031 its like my dad used to say when he was alive the library is the poor mans university
7264032 most of the time i just come here to kind of get my thoughts together
7264033 this being the main library theres more computers here more resources they should close the smaller branches and keep the main one open
7264034 should we be pouring money into a facility thats going to be renewed in two to three to four years
7264035 there are areas in there that we can put books or put stacks or put archives where they arent going to get wet from pipes or rain
7264036 if its 25 percent of the size of the current library then theres a lot of things that will be left behind
7264037 the concept of what the temporary library will be hasnt been really explained
7264038 when the city council adopts the budget which it must do by sept 15 they will be directing us to come back to them with a plan for a satellite facility
7264039 if that plan is implemented well shutter the main library but not before that
7264040 if it takes months it could definitely impact our ability to recoup the 1 8 million that were trying to save
7264041 for any temporary facility there has to be a site in mind
7264042 we have to know where it is what its going to hold and begin planning for a new alternative site together
7264043 i dont expect that the school district will be doing field trips
7264044 that could be a huge impact if the schools take their field trips to the satellite libraries
7264045 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny i was never boney boney but i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
7264046 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating
7264047 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
7264048 passed over clinton for his running mate because she had been too openly critical of him
7264049 is aimed clearly at the 18 million disappointed democrats who voted for her during the long primary season
7264050 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7264051 i love bill clinton but can you imagine being vice president
7264052 i know i havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington
7264053 but ive been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change
7264054 one of things we know is that youve got to have people who can bring about change
7264055 unfortunately change is going to have to go through capitol hill and youve got to have somebody who is knowledgeable about capitol hill the difference between john mccain and joe biden is that one is on the side of change and one isnt
7264056 hell have a fist in the face of john mccain every day and i think he has this level of gravitas as well
7264057 were lucky to have both it showcases obamas judgment that he chose somebody like this a good pick not just for august or october but a good pick in the event that something happens when hes president of the united states
7264058 weve had quite a strong weekend on a nice new circuit to get some good points both me and heikki it was overall a strong weekend for us
7264059 at the start obviously i was on the dirty side but had a reasonable start
7264060 i wasnt anywhere near as quick as felipe and robert was pushing pretty hard for the first couple of corners but after that it was fine its quite difficult to overtake here so i was just keeping the gap steady to him but in the final stint he was able to start pulling away

7264077 biden has a way with words using thousands of them when ten would do and five would be perfect thus the law of averages is against him the chances of a gaffe increase proportionately with the number of words employed
7264078 the only thing standing between joe biden and the presidency is his mouth that though is no small matter it is a himalayan barrier a sahara of a handicap a summers day in death valley a winters night at the pole either one an endless list of metaphors intended to show you both the immensity of the problem and to illustrate it with the op ed version of excess this alas is joe biden

7264086 weve even sent up a couple of sets of harry potter
7264087 theyve been asking for childrens books and young peoples books and some adult books too
7264088 were hoping we can continue to send books and branch out of other communities up there

7264229 it is also true that in january 2008 petrosa purchased a spot cargo of reformate from mesa energy
7264230 a fact is that petrosa in good faith concluded two deals with mesa energy both deals were conducted in full compliance with petrosas internal processes which are aligned with the pfma act
7264231 this deal not only ensured that we were furthering our mandate of securing the supply of petroleum for our country but also advancing the goals of black economic empowerment
7264232 we will not pull any stops in our quest to advance this responsibility

7264256 conspiracy theorists are saying that since nintendo has already met their end of march goals with 6 million units shipped and are building up supply continuing the demand and ensuring awesome second quarter sales
7264257 unfortunately with american retailers now running at 2 5 percent availability some are expecting the wii shortage to continue through 2009
7264258 i think that nintendo figuring that their technology was kind of last generation were just not just thinking about going higher than 300 they certainly could have charged 400 until they exhausted that demand then cut the prices to 300 and exhausted that demand and they always would have been able to supply them

7264294 there is a popular myth developing that jacob zumas ascent signals a break with the more authoritarian aspects of president thabo mbekis tenure and that his presidency would usher in a new era of openness
7264295 yet zumas troubled relationship with the media militates against that as do several laws presently making their way through the parliamentary process
7264296 coupled with various other threats from zuma and his allies to the values enshrined in our constitution this package of legislation harks back to a darker past and bodes ill for democratic governance under a post mbeki administration
7264297 the bill is nothing more than an attempt by anc mps to remove the board members aligned to mbeki to ingratiate themselves with their new party president and his supporters and to pave the way for further political deployments and dismissals
7264298 by supporting this bill anc mps have shown themselves to be just as spineless as when they first agreed to accept mbekis hand picked candidates
7264299 if politicians use organs of state to entrench their own power the inevitable result is a descent into authoritarian rule
7264300 this is typified by zimbabwean president robert mugabe who has manipulated the electoral commission the state broadcaster and the security forces to cling to power
7264301 yet again zumas anc is demonstrating that it poses a serious threat to constitutional freedoms by passing laws confirming their leaders stated belief that the anc is more important than the constitution

7264305 they dont even care that the soccer world cup will take place in south africa
7264306 on an international platform harmed the image of south africa irreparably and promoted hate speech
7264307 there is simply no evidence to suggest that any group of south africans is against staging the 2010 soccer world cup in south africa
7264308 thankfully pahad himself will no longer be in government when the tournament kicks off it is clear that he is ill able to make it the successful event that we know it will be
7264309 proof that government is beginning to panic about our readiness for 2010

7264601 pap speelt nu een liedje voor mama hij houdt oprecht van haar dat zie ik en merk ik hij is heel begaan met haar en mij maar soms soms verlang ik naar die tijd van toen jij mama en ik hand in hand in het park gewoon samen en niet dit verdriet

7264603 mama ik probeer zo in haar te geloven maar het gaat niet

7264620 schat schat ik ben zo stom geweest ik heb allemaal domme dingen gezegd simon is weggelopen en dorien heeft me een klap gegeven allemaal terecht maar wat moet ik doen doen om te vechten tegen die wanhoop en machteloosheid ik heb heb vannacht gedroomd over ons het was zo heerlijk weet je nog onze eerste ontmoeiting koud en zakelijk maar je had me al betoverd hoe geen idee maar jij had magie en had mij betoverd we zagen elkaar vaker en jij bleef cynisch dat vond ik moeilijk het moeilijkste was het blauwtje dat je me liet lopen ik had me nog nooit zo stom gevoeld en naar een nacht flink doorzakken ik geloofde niet meer in later dat jij en ik ooit samen gingen komen ik werd wakker met een kater en nam me voor nooit meer verliefd te worden maar ik kon je niet vergeten britt met haar mooie ogen koppige gedrag ik dacht meer aan jou dan aan mijn clienten en zomaar opeens op woensdag belde school simon had een ongelukje gehad ik schrok me dood gelukkig viel het mee maar jou weerzien ik smolt weg mijn buik kriebelde je had mijn hart gestolen en was voortvluchtig je verwarmde me van binnen en deed me zweven op een roze wolk en nog altijd die koude blik in je ogen je zag me niet staan althans dat dacht ik nu weet ik dat je dat wel deed maar voor je gevoel niets met een advocaat wilde en ik was gewoon een zacht ventje dat niet paste bij zo een stoere flik als gij maar ik droomde over dacht aan je altijd was je in mijn gedachten en opeens zat ik bij je in de keuken en mocht ik blijven die avond zal ik nooit vergeten dat was zo fantastisch onze eerste zoen hij leek een eeuwigheid te duren en het was zo heerlijk we stonden af te wassen en ik gooide wat schuim naar je je wilde de borstel van mij afpakken en we stoeiden om de afwas kwast je smeerde wat zeep aan mijn wang en opeens kusten wij elkaar eerst kort en het was zo grappig jij en ik zeiden tegelijk sorry om vervolgens intiem verder te zoenen verder dan zoenen zijn we niet gekomen en dat was niet erg ik ben naar huis gezweeft en simon heeft me heel erg geplaagd dat deerde me niet stralend nam ik de verkeersboete in ontvangst breed glimlachend veegde ik de hondenpoep van mijn schoen god wat was ik verliefd simon heeft die tijd geloof ik zo een beetje alles voor elkaar gekregen want papa johan leefde in een grote roze wolk en dan onze tweede date een beetje gerfriemel aan elkaar puberaal rond de fontijn gerend en gezoend onder de lantarenpaal jouw koude handen op mijn rug mijn handen op jou billen helemaal van de wereld opgeschikt door een toeterde collega van je
7264621 you you are always on my mind your your the one that i am living for you you are ever lasting by
7264622 hoe is het met u houd u het wel vol anders kan u altijd kontakt opnemen met onze psycholoog
7264623 het gaat wel denk ik het is meer die onzekerheid
7264624 dat is altijd heel erg zwaar maar blijf geloven houd de moed er in dat zal positief werken op uw vrouw
7264625 het is een samenloop van omstandigheden denk ik uw zoon lijdt er ook onder iedereen ziekte ongevallen en dit soort dingen hebben een enorme impact op het gezin het vergt emotioneel zo veel van een mens dat er hoe dan ook een bom ploft dat maken we dikwijls mee en meestal komt het dan wel goed bij de ene kost het meer inspanning dan bij de andere persoon maar met inzet bereik je veel
7264626 dorien zoekt simon als simon terug komt ga ik met hem praten en hem mijn excuus maken
7264627 ook slecht ik voel me zo raar bang en verdrietig
7264628 het is ook zo klote je kunt niets doen alleen afwachten zo onwerkelijk zo raar zo frustrerend
7264629 mama nooit meer mama nooit meer lieve dotje nooit meer een beker warme twee nooit meer mijn haren in een knotje nooit meer doe voorzichtig sluit je de deur goed af nooit meer pas op de bus blijf van de alcohol af nooit meer twee armen stevig om heen misschien wel voor altijd helemaal alleen starend naar de sterren liggend in het gras en lach en een traan denkend aan het was een foto aan de wand de advertentie in de krant is het waar is het binnenkort echt nooit meer mama nooit meer tastbaar
7264630 ik heb het lekker warm al voel ik me wel rot want wat papa zei vond ik echt verschrikkelijk
7264631 dat versta ik dat was ook een rot opmerking maar je vader heeft heel veel spijt hij bedoelde dat niet zo echt niet we zijn allemaal over onze toeren
7264632 simon het spijt me zo het spijt me zo verschrikkelijk
7264633 simon het spijt me ik had niet zo tegen je uit moeten vallen
7264634 pap dacht je nu echt dat ik een vermoeden had dat je er een einde aan wilde maken ik ben bezorgd om je omdat ik om je geef en niet omdat ik je wil pesten of controleren of wilde je echt voor de bus lopen
7264635 neen natuurlijk niet zoon ik wilde liever niet weg bij britt ik wilde bij haar zijn zij is ziek ik niet
7264636 als je zo doorgaat dan ben je wel ziek dat wil ik niet dorien en ik geven om je heel veel zelfs
7264637 dat weet ik jongen dat weet ik ik zal beter op mij zelf passen goed
7264638 ik begrijp je simon het spijt me oprecht ik ben zo verdrietig om britt gewoon ze is mijn lievie en dan ligt ze daar zo zwak en bleek in bed terwijl ze normaal zo kwiek is
7264639 maar dat is waar dat is johan die mij vaak boterhammetjes met choco kwam brengen
7264640 johan die met een duik in het zwembad zijn zwemshort verloor johan haar johan
7264641 i het is weer voorbij die mooie zomer i johan had er een melanchonisch gevoel bij dat liedje had hij eens voor haar gezongen toen ze mopperend constateerde dat het weer regende en koud was
7264642 ben je hier nu al weer ik wil dat je gaat ik weet niet wat je van me moet maar ik hoef je niet te zien tenzij je me kunt vertellen waar mark is
7264643 lieve brittje kom terug lieve schat ik smeek je kom terug laat ons weer een worden
7264644 papa papa ze kan er niets aan doen je moet op ons vertrouwen wij doen ons best haar herinneringen terug te krijgen
7264645 papa je ziet zo bleek je wordt toch niet ziek
7264646 ik zie haar zo graag zoon ze is zo lief en mooi
7264647 hey pap kom we gaan naar huis je moet rusten dorien redt het wel hier ik haal haar straks wel op met de fiets
7264648 pap geloof me eens komt het goed maar je moet net als dorien dat zei niets willen forceren anders blijft ze dat beeld houden wat ze nu van je heeft
7264649 simon het spijt me zo het spijt me zo verschrikkelijk
7264650 simon het spijt me ik had niet zo tegen je uit moeten vallen
7264651 pap dacht je nu echt dat ik een vermoeden had dat je er een einde aan wilde maken ik ben bezorgd om je omdat ik om je geef en niet omdat ik je wil pesten of controleren of wilde je echt voor de bus lopen
7264652 neen natuurlijk niet zoon ik wilde liever niet weg bij britt ik wilde bij haar zijn zij is ziek ik niet
7264653 als je zo doorgaat dan ben je wel ziek dat wil ik niet dorien en ik geven om je heel veel zelfs
7264654 dat weet ik jongen dat weet ik ik zal beter op mij zelf passen goed
7264655 ik begrijp je simon het spijt me oprecht ik ben zo verdrietig om britt gewoon ze is mijn lievie en dan ligt ze daar zo zwak en bleek in bed terwijl ze normaal zo kwiek is
7264656 schat schat ik ga naar huis naar de kinderen ze hebben me nodig het spijt me dat ik je nu alleen moet laten
7264657 meneer ik denk dat mevrouw langzaam heel langzaam zal ontwaken maar pas op dat zal nog wel uren kunnen duren
7264658 meneer meneer u moet u dit niet persoonlijk aantrekken dit komt vaker voor dat mensen als ze ontwaken niet iedereen herkennen
7264659 omdat zij misschien het laatste zijn waar ze aan dacht dat is nooit te achterhalen maar meestal komt het goed en zal ze u naar verloop van tijd herkennen het belangrijkste is dat u niet boos wordt en haar tijd gunt
7264660 mag ik haar zien of is het beter van niet
7264661 nu slaapt ze maar als ze wil dat u gaat moet u dat respecteren het is beter niets te forceren
7264662 pap doe niet zo ze kan er niets aan doen
7264663 ja en dan ben je jaloers moet mama pap maar vergeten omdat meneertje van lancker niet samen met een overleden man in haar hart wil leven wake up papa dat kan niet verdomme heb toch een beetje begrip
7264664 nee je moeder moet mark niet vergeten ze kan beter mij vergeten zo bijzonder ben ik nu weer niet
7264665 nee inderdaad je bent een softe lamzak die ze beter kwijt is dan rijk
7264666 dat is toch wat je wilt horen want dat mama super gek op je is altijd over je praat als je weg bent en je naam nog altijd op blaadjes schrijft met een hartje dat geloof je toch niet
7264667 pap het is heel erg wat er nu gebeurd maar mama is zich er niet van bewust ze gaat je nog heel hard nodig hebben wat denk je ze moet weer verwerken dat papa dood is en ze zal zich jou echt wel weer herinneren je moet haar tijd geven ik snap je frustratie en verdriet hier om maar probeer die moed er in te houden en anders haal een foto boek op met fotos van jou en haar samen dingen die tonen dat mark er niet meer is haar dagboek dat ligt onder in de la als je dat nu eens ophaalt dan leest ze haar eigen verhalen weer
7264668 dat draadje ben jij in mijn leven jij bent de rode draad in mijn leven en die ring wil je met mij trouwen
7264669 schat je hebt me overvallen en voor je gewonnen want het antwoord is ja ja ik wil met je trouwen
7264670 ik ben zo bang jou te verliezen dorien heeft me alles verteld over mark maar ook het ongeluk van mama ik heb vannacht gedroomd dat jij daar lag allleen jij stierf in de armen van mama ze kuste je je blies daarmee je laatste adem uit ik was zo verdrietig ik heb door het ziekenhuis gerend gerend en gerend en de gangen werden steeds langer en langer en mijn adem sneed in mijn borstkast het was verschrikkelijk
7264671 sorry jongen het spijt me dat je een beetje aan mijn aandacht bent ontsnapt
7264672 dat ik nog geknuffeld wil worden met mijn bijna 16 jarig bestaan
7264673 welnee nee jij mag altijd een knuffel komen halen wat ik wel gek vind is je pyjama we moeten morgen maar een paar nieuwe gaan kopen
7264674 slaapwel papa en niet te veel piekeren geloof in haar zoals je al die tijd hebt gedaan
7264675 eeh papa wil je mijn rug in smeren normaal doet mama dat en het is al een paar keer niet gebeurd en het jeukt zo
7264676 sorry als ik nu lastig ben de buren doen soms zo raar toen ze hoorden dat ik een nachtje in mam haar bed had geslapen naast jou omdat ik zo bang was van het verschrikkelijke onweer en mama ook al niet thuis was vonden ze je een vies ventje
7264677 nee helemaal niet tenzij je mama vla in haar gezicht smeert maar anders niet
7264678 wel dan ik zal jou nooit iets aan kunnen doen zolang wij weten hoe het zit laat de mensen dan maar denken
7264679 je moet slapen papa het komt wel goed maar eerst moet je slapen
7264680 het geeft niet mama maar ik wil met je praten
7264681 hoor je wel wat je zegt mark is vast even weg maar hij komt wel terug dat weet ik zeker
7264682 neen mama papa leeft niet meer al jaren niet meer
7264683 dorien wat zeg jij nu papa dood hoe kan papa nu dood zijn papa leeft nog ik ben zeker
7264684 wat is dat hoe kom je er aan verdomme dorien zeg het me
7264685 mama vloek en roep niet zo het is nochtans echt waar papa is neergestoken door danny weet je dat dan echt niet meer het spijt dat ik zo ontactvol ben maar anders kan ik je niet duidelijk maken dat papa al zeker 7 jaar niet meer leeft
7264686 ophouden dorien houd alsjeblieft op waar haal je die onzin vandaan
7264687 dag meisje wat kan ik voor je doen moet je soms plassen

7264690 wat sorry kom binnen wat is er gebeurd meisje en hoe is het met haar
7264691 niet zo goed ze herkend papa niet meer en denk dat mark nog leeft en als ik zeg dat mark niet meer leeft schreeuwt ze alles bij elkaar en doet me zo veel verdriet ik herken mijn mama niet meer de vrouw in het ziekenhuis bed is niet mijn mama en ze doet johan zo veel pijn straks gaan ze uit een al weet ik dat papa mama altijd trouw zal blijven ze wil hem niet meer zien en schreeuwt ook naar hem
7264692 tony maakte zich zorgen om britt ze hadden elkaar al tijden niet meer gesproken maar vergeten was ze haar nog niet
7264693 dat weet ik niet ze zeggen dat het goed komt maar wanneer
7264694 en zal ik ook eens meegaan naar je mama kijken of ze mij ook herkend al denk ik dat ze dat niet doet we hebben elkaar maanden al niet meer gezien
7264695 geeft niet ik ben allang blij dat je me wilt helpen het is wel stom dat ik alleen naar je toe kom als ik je nodig heb
7264696 meisje toch dat geeft toch niets ik snap je best en ik help je graag
7264697 kom eens kijken hoe het nu met je vrouw is
7264698 theo ter kleef psycholoog ik kom eens met u praten
7264699 pardon ik heb geen geestesdokter nodig maar hij daar achter je wel schijnbaar denkt hij dat hij zich alles kan permitteren hij wil maar niet inzien dat mark er nog is en dat mark en ik samen zijn
7264700 in zijn dromen ja als hij zielig en alleen in bed ligt en stoute mannendroompjes heeft maar in het echte leven niet ik heb hem nog nooit eerder gezien voor ik in het ziekenhuis lag
7264701 en toch zegt u hem nog niet eerder te hebben gezien
7264702 ik zei het hij heeft een psycholoog nodig niet ik
7264703 verdomme pa wat doe je nu toch weer ben je helemaal gek aan het worden
7264704 papa ze is zich zelf niet en jij ook niet je maakt me bang papa
7264705 het spijt me ik weet me gewoon geen raad meer niet met britt niet met mij zelf
7264706 dat snap ik maar moet je dan zo eng doen mij het gevoel geven dat je er een einde aan wilt maken papa doe niet zo over dramatisch
7264707 ze moet gewoon op haar kamer zijn misschien is ze even naar de wc
7264708 tony ik denk dat ze papa gaat zoeken maar papa is dood
7264709 dat weten we niet ze is weg gelopen we vrezen dat ze op zoek is naar mark
7264710 pap je moet iets eten met niets eten komt mama niet terug

7264713 simon toe verdomme ik ga britt zoeken en bemoeder mij niet zo
7264714 simon het antwoord is nee en waar zijn mijn sleutels waar zijn verdomme mijn sleutels
7264715 johan liep naar de bank en zag simon liggen helemaal opgekruld en hij snikte zachtjes
7264716 sorry simon ik had niet zo tegen je moeten uitvliegen
7264717 en toch deed je het ik had het moeten zeggen maar ik ben bezorgd moet je eens in de spiegel kijken je bent hartstikke ziek moeten dorien en ik dan straks alles alleen doen omdat jij en mama in het ziekenhuis liggen

7264730 tony bedankt echt heel erg bedankt ga je nu naar het ziekenhuis
7264731 britt vertelde het eens ze had het zo vaak over je dat ik zo ongeveer alles van je weet
7264732 ze leeft nog maar ze is flink onderkoeld we doen ons best als ze de ochtend haalt dan is ze buiten levendsgevaar

7264735 johan dat kan je niet doen je kunt nu niet meer weg rennen want waar ren je voor voor je eigen verdriet voor de confrontatie of voor je wrok
7264736 ik ben voor mij zelf op de vlucht voor mijn eigenschaduw geweten gevoel en mijn eigen stomme ik
7264737 johan je bent niet stom denk zo niet dat is heel ambetant
7264738 dan ben ik dat maar ik moet rust tot over 3 dagen
7264739 het is een openbare ruimte dus laat je vooral niet tegenhouden ik ben alleen niet zo een aangenaam gezelschap
7264740 sorry johan je ziet er echt goed uit zeg nouja ik bedoel je figuur je gezicht staat zo ongelukkig
7264741 bedankt nee weet je wat het is ik ben samen met iemand met britt we zijn getrouwd en dat is echt fantastisch nu wil het feit dat ze een ongeluk heeft gehad en een tijdje in coma heeft gelegen met als gevolg dat ze mij niet meer herkend alles is weg en ik boezem haar alleen maar angst in
7264742 wa erg maar met alle respect waarom ben je dan hier
7264743 om na te denken en ze wil me toch niet zien
7264744 hij slaapt samen met dorien de dochter van britt bij tony dat is een collega van britt
7264745 wil je mij excuseren ik ben moe bedankt voor je steun pien hier heb je mijn kaartje daar staat mijn gsm nummer ook bij op
7264746 ok ik ga ook maar eens naar boven kamer 408
7264747 pien dat kan niet ik heb britt ik blijf haar trouw
7264748 maar johan ze hoeft hier van toch niets te weten ik zal niets zeggen echt niet
7264749 pien luister ik houd van britt er is op deze aardbol geen n vrouw die haar kan evenaren die mij zo fantastisch doet zweven van geluk als zij dat ga ik niet kapot maken door zon een stomme one night stand
7264750 nee geweldig heilige johan als je zo van haar houdt wat doe je dan hier en je straalt ook echt van geluk ja daarmee dat je net wel snikkend in mijn armen zat maar verder dan dat ho maar
7264751 pien ik wil britt niet bedriegen snap dat dan ik houd van haar en ik heb je toch niet de indruk gegeven meer te willen dan te praten
7264752 johan wees nu eerlijk je wilt britt trouw blijven maar wil je dan diep in je hart niet met mij de nacht doorbrengen even nergens meer aan denken
7264753 pien je bent een mooie vrouw en een fijn persoon om mee te praten maar ik kan je niet geven wat je wilt wat ik wil het niet niet iedere man is zo
7264754 hoe is het toch mogelijk dat juist jij niet zo bent
7264755 omdat ik van mijn vrouw houd en daarbij er zijn meer mannen zo als ik juist de mannen die met andere vrouwen dan hun eigen vrouw naar bed gaan zijn verkeerd zo een man verdien je niet
7264756 het is wel best meneertje van lancker ik ben alleen maar goed om je hart bij uit te storten en dat is het
7264757 hard gezegd wel ja maar daarmee zou ik dus kunnen concluderen dat ik alleen maar goed ben voor de seks
7264758 johan met tony simon is nog altijd niet thuis en ik weet niet waar hij zit bel me zo snel mogelijk terug als je wilt
7264759 johan je zoon is thuis hij heeft geblowt je kent het wel experimenteer fase van pubers het zou echt beter zijn als je thuis kwam
7264760 het is me gelukt mijn leven terug op te pakken en er iets behoorlijks van kan maken
7264761 zo jongen zo veel verdriet ist af met uw lief
7264762 britt mijn vrouw ze heeft een ongeluk gehad best hevig ze was in coma en bij het onwakende herkende ze me niet meer ik ben een vreemde geworden voor haar en ze wil me niet meer zien de foto van ons samen is verscheurd dat doet zo veel pijn ze weet gewoon niet meer wie ik ben terwijl wij voor haar ongeluk ongelovelijk verliefd waren nog voor ze vertrok hadden we de liefde bedreven vol passie en liefde en nu voelt net of dat moment een soort afscheid was wat natuurlijk niet klopt maar gevoelsmatig wel
7264763 dat is normaal mensen zoeken altijd naar een houvast handvatten
7264764 ik bedoel dat je nu wel kan gaan zitten janken en haar verschrikkelijk mist en verwijt dat ze je niet meer kent je kan er ook voor vechten dat ze je weer gaat herkennen nog is ze jouw vrouw en als je haar zou vertrouwen net zoals je dat voorheen hebt gedaan en voor haar zal vechten dan helpt dat veel meer dan hier zitten janken en gestolen servertjes vol te krabbelen
7264765 ik ik denk dat ik maar eens naar huis ga bedankt voor je opheldering en de figuurlijke schop onder mijn kont
7264766 dat weet ik ik wil johan zien met hem praten heb je zijn gsm nummer

7264781 ik vind je mooi en lief ik wil zo graag alle herinneren terug krijgen wil je me daarbij helpen
7264782 mooi shirt heb je daar aan dat staat je echt mooi
7264783 britt het probleem is dat je me hoe zeer je er ook niets aan kon doen pijn hebt gedaan en het heeft mij meer gedaan dan dat ik verwacht had en nu je weer wilt zoenen voelt het niet meer zoals vroeger ik heb tijd nodig dit te verwerken op een rijtje te zetten snap je dat ik moet het verwerken en dat klinkt stom maar hoe je tegen mij deed dat heeft mij zeer gedaan
7264784 neen neen dat wil ik niet geef mij wat tijd als je wilt
7264785 ik geef je alle tijd die je nodig hebt echt waar alleen je komt dan toch nog wel
7264786 ja natuurlijk maar nu ga ik naar mijn zoon ik heb daar nog een hartig woordje mee te bespreken
7264787 dat weet ik niet maar waarom wil je me opeens zo graag zien
7264788 je brief en ik weet weer dat mark gestorven is ik heb mijn dagboek gelezen en fotos bekeken
7264789 nee maar ik voel me nu wel veel meer verbonden met je en maak me ook zorgen om je en vind je heel erg knap

7264791 ik houd ook van u schat ik zal mijn best doen vechten voor ons dat beloof ik je
7264792 dat kan ja maar of ik daar zin in heb is een tweede
7264793 simon je hebt drugs gebruikt en dat vind ik heel erg
7264794 simon zeg me wat je dwars zit maar moet je dan gaan blowen
7264795 neen maar een kind die ziet hoe zijn ouder zich zelf kapot zuipt zich verwaarloosd en zijn eigen kinderen in de steek laat dat kind wordt wel heel snel volwassen enig idee hoe verschrikkelijk zoiets iets is zien hoe je eigen vader zo doet hoe hij zijn kinderen in de steek laat
7264796 simon ik ben geen drank verslaafde en ik probeer mijn leven te beteren maar ik wil niet dat jij je leven vergooit aan die rommel
7264797 natuurlijk kan me dat wat schelen en ik zal je er nu niet voor straffen maar kap er mee stop met die rot drugs voor het jou stopt
7264798 simon zeg zo iets niet je weet dat je nu onzin uit kraamt
7264799 ja natuurlijk je bent mijn zoon het spijt me als ik je zo verdrietig gemaakt heb maar daarom houd ik wel van je echt
7264800 sorry pap ik ik zal het niet meer doen maar stop jij dan met drinken en eigenwijs doen
7264801 hey papa ik wil niet lullig doen maar je pannenkoek verbrandt
7264802 papa ik stel voor dat je na het eten gaat slapen
7264803 doe dat dan ook maar jij vertrekt zonder te groeten je zuipt veel te veel en verteld aan iedereen hoe verschrikkelijk benadeeld je wordt maar geen seconde realiseer jij je hoe het is voor mama dat mama bijna niets meer weet hoe graag mama jou weer helemaal herkent je weer in haar armen kan houden en al dat soort dingen ze doet het toch niet expres mama was altijd super dol op je en dat komt echt wel weer terug
7264804 daarom is zo iets wel moeilijk als ze opeens doodsbang voor je is wil dat je weg gaat hatelijk doet
7264805 natuurlijk maar pap het is voor je zelf en voor mama veel beter als nagaat dat ze er niets aan kan doen ik vind het ook niet fijn dat ze zo over papa mark sprak dat raakte mij ook maar je moet je op een bepaald moment wel realiseren dat ze er niets aan kan doen en niet weg kwijnen in zelf medelijden
7264806 en als je verdriet hebt dan hebben simon en ik liever dat je dat met ons deelt en niet met de fles begrijp je dat
7264807 wat is er heb je die onverlaat van hier naast in zak en as doen zitten en fickie vermoord zodat deze nooit meer keft

7264814 ja erg h ik moest even mijn zinnen verzetten maar ik kan het niet
7264815 schat toch dat is toch logisch maar hoelang gaan ze hem nu nog vast houden

7264817 schat toch wat verschrikkelijk wil je dat ik eens met je zoon ga praten

7264819 natuurlijk schat maar wil je dat ik er eens mee ga praten
7264820 mijn zoon in de gevangenis ik kan dat niet geloven
7264821 johan ik houd van je steeds meer je bent zo knap maar ook lief het spijt me dat ik je zo in de steek heb gelaten de afgelopen tijd
7264822 hij is sinds gistermorgen weg hij ging de deur uit we hadden ruzie en kwam niet meer thuis tot ik telefoon kreeg en vernam dat hij was opgepakt
7264823 dat was de dag dat hij met mij gepraat heeft en ik was zo stom om pas na een dag te realiseren dat hij gelijk had had ik maar gezien dat het niet goed ging met hem maar ik zie niets ik ben zo stom
7264824 lievie ik zal mijn best doen voor je simon houdt echt nog van zijn vader daar ben ik zeker van anders had hij niet zo voor jouw gepleit
7264825 ik heb er zo veel spijt van mama ik wilde het niet ik wilde niet stelen maar ik werd er in meegesleurd en die drugs ik voelde me zo verdrietig en met dat spul niet maar die dag ik had wat anders gekregen een pilletje en ik weet niet meer wat ik precies gedaan heb maar ik heb er zo een spijt van ik kan papa zo niet onder ogen komen hij moest zich haast wel doodschamen voor mij en ik ben ook boos op hem boos dat hij mij zo in de steek liet
7264826 simon toch je papa is heel erg geschrokken maar ook verdrietig hij wacht buiten
7264827 dat dat wil ik niet dan slaat hij een slecht figuur
7264828 omdat ik weet dat je geen slechte jongen bent en omdat ik wilde weten waarom jij papa niet meer wilt zien
7264829 zijn kantoor dat was ergens bij een parkje in de buurt maar niet het parkje waar ze gewandeld hadden net en het was niet ver van het commissariaat ze herinnerde zich vaag dat ze wel eens in haar lunchpauze naar hem toe ging
7264830 in je ogen staan twee sterren helder en schoon jou naam staat gekerft in elke boom een lach die mij doet zweven ik geniet sinds jij bent in mijn leven twee zachte handen op mijn buik onze liefde is prachtig onze liefde is puik jouw lippen op de mijne dat gevoel zal hoop ik nooit verdwijnen jij en ik voor altijd samen jij en ik voor altijd samen
7264831 ja het spijt me johan dat ik je kwetst door mijn slecht geheugen nu maar weet je nog hoe we hier gevree n hadden heel de nacht onder de sterrenhemel hoe we puberaal hier gezwommen hebben jij me zoende onder water
7264832 dat weet ik nog ja dat was zo geweldig die nacht
7264833 ik heb met annie gepraat over jou het was zwaar omdat ik zo moest nadenken maar ik weet nu wel meer dingen zoals dat jij van musicals houdt en raad eens wij gaan naar tarzan britt gaat met haar tarzan naar tarzan
7264834 lieverd wat lief van je het spijt me dat ik zo bruut doe soms
7264835 neen niet bruut maar loop niet weg schat dat is niet goed praat me mij scheld of jank maar weg lopen is nooit de oplossing
7264836 ja en ik haat het stel je voor overkomt jou of mij iets dan hebben we het niet goed kunnen maken
7264837 dat is zo maar soms ben ik zo boos of verdrietig en dan ben ik liever alleen dan dat ik je kwets
7264838 dat is dan maar zo een relatie is niet alleen fun en liefde er kan ook eens geruziet worden elkaar flink de waarheid zeggen of gewoon je woede uiten onze band is sterk genoeg om dat te doorstaan en als jij een keer flink wilt tieren ok ik doe dat ook daarna kunnen we het uitpraten als alle woede er uit is maar weg lopen dat is niet goed dan ga je op den duur ook voor je zelf op de loop
7264839 je hebt gelijk daar is veel fantasie voor nodig met je theezakjesarmen
7264840 ik plag ik plaag hoe jij niet plaagt en dat is
7264841 schat ik heb dit zo gemist ik weet weer hoe fijn het is met je de liefde te delen te zoenen je lief te hebben
7264842 schat toch ik vind je zo dapper je bent echt heel erg sterk ik ben trots op je het spijt me dat ik zo weg liep
7264843 sst schat het is je vergeven geef me nog wat tijd maar tussen jou en mij komt het wel goed dat weet ik zeker maar simon wilde dat je dit las
7264844 lieverd lieverd ik snap dat je bang bent maar de vlammen in rennen lost ook niets op
7264845 hij heeft een kettinkje dat wat je voor hem op de gentse feesten hebt gekocht
7264846 schatje schatje we moeten hoop houden geloven in hem dat is heel belangrijk
7264847 dat weet ik wel maar het is zo raar niet zeker zijn of het wel simon is niet zeker zijn of hij het redt of niet die onzekerheid is zo slopend
7264848 ik vind dat ook eng maar maak je zelf niet te druk je bent al op je tandvlees aan het lopen
7264849 lieverd ga nu zitten ik wil niet dat je instort
7264850 uw zoon hij is er door maar ligt in kritieke toestand op intensieve en het gaat niet goed met hem zijn longen zijn flink beschadigt we vrezen er voor de komende uren gaan kritiek worden
7264851 die kans bestaat maar er bestaat ook een kans dat hij het haalt
7264852 meneer ik snap uw angst maar het is echt afwachten nu en ik wil u er op voorbereiden dat uw zoon op zijn rug en borstkast een aantal brandwonden heeft dat u daar niet van schrikt
7264853 schatteke ik vind het ook verschrikkelijk maar je moet niet panikeren het komt goed je zoon is strek net als jij jij betn van binnen ook heel sterk heel mooi en lief

7264858 papa papa laat je troosten deel je hart met ons met mama en mij wij zijn ook verdrietig dit moeten we samen doen dat kan je niet alleen
7264859 pas goed op die ouwe van me wees er zuinig op hij loopt soms in zeven sloten tegelijk wees voor hem als 6 bruggetjes en 1 veerman
7264860 sorry johan ten eerste wil ik niet dat jij je verdriet weg zuipt en ten tweede ik heb ook verdriet ik wilde je troosten en dan doe jij zo bot dat doet me zeer ik doe mijn best voor je ik wil je helpen en dan duw jij mij weg als een haan met drek aan de poten
7264861 schat ik was bezorgd om je ik heb dat niet zo bedoeld echt niet ik wil je niet verliezen
7264862 dat had jij je dan maar eerder moeten bedenken ik ga slapen ik bed doodmoe

7264922 johan nam haar meer op zich en voelde haar wang tegen zijn wang
7264923 dat is waar schat ik zal mijn best doen beloofd
7264924 der zwischenfall hatte keinerlei auswirkungen f r die besch ftigten des kraftwerks und f r die umwelt
7264925 der brand ereignete sich im konventionellen bereich des kraftwerks und weit entfernt von den nuklearbrennst ben
7264926 organization dedicated to improving the administration of justice by providing leadership and service to court systems in the united states
7264927 he even undertook a tour with officials and now he is blaming the pdp government headed by mufti sahib to become some sort of hero
7264928 the only way temperatures can be brought down is to open the muzzafarbad srinagar road if the army could be withdrawan from the state of punjab after the militancy there was under control why cant we do the same in jammu and kashmir in an honourable manner many nationals leaders wanted to catch me by my throat for making that statement at the all party meet called by prime minister manmohan singh
7264929 the need of the hour is that an amicable solution should be found to the kashmir problem do not go by the statements of politicians as they say one thing while in delhi and another while in srinagar in case of the national conference omar abdullah says he would resign from parliament if force is used against the people of kashmir while farooq sahib says that greater autonomy would satisfy the people but the truth is that no leader is in control of what is happening on the ground

7264933 the government is yet to announce the date of the general election involving the two vote system under mmp and due to take place within 3 months yet it says it cannot organise a one vote referendum within 10 months
7264934 the attempt to delay democracy by this government is breath taking this is a cynical attempt to muzzle the voice of nzers who are opposed to the hugely unpopular and highly flawed anti smacking law
7264935 more than 10 of voters have met the high threshold of asking for a referendum and recent polls suggest that between 80 90 oppose the legislation it makes complete sense both economically and in terms of timing to do it at the same time as the general election
7264936 at the 1999 general election voters were instructed to place the two cir voting papers together with the parliamentary voting paper into a single ballot box for each electorate this together with the fact that the cir voting papers were not distinctly coloured contributed to significant delays to the sort and count of voting papers
7264937 in other words the problems experienced by the last referendum held on an election day simply came down to poor organisation
7264938 the transition had been tremendously smooth and its clear that were passing an enormous milestone towards reaching uss george washingtons ultimate forward deployment assignment to the western pacific and indian oceans

7264945 our sole purpose is to be the eyes for the aircraft so they can be forewarned if another aircraft is in their vicinity friend or foe
7264946 the greatest thing that we get from the exercise is the fact that we get face to face brief and debrief opportunities with one another something that we normally do not get between ourselves and awacs crews
7264947 its really great to work with people from different places
7264948 the crew learns something new with every place we go
7264949 the integration of our two systems is integral in our missions and the more we are able to take from each occasion that we work together the better we are able to execute our missions with precision
7264950 they deployed to the most challenging parts of the world and not only developed as a team they exemplified the word teamwork throughout their deployment we are grateful to their families and friends for waiting as they did our nations work
7264951 being back is an unbelievable feeling i am very proud of the crew and all they have accomplished during these last six months
7264952 their ability to successfully deploy and execute required tasking was a direct reflection of their high state of readiness and extensive training

7264958 the ship was built with a specific goal and purpose in mind to operate in shallow waters it also has the flexibility as 40 percent of it is large reconfigurable space so that you can put the specific mission packages into it
7264959 he is your friend your partner your defender your dog you are his life his love his leader he will be yours faithful and true to the last beat of his heart you owe it to him to be worthy of such devotion
7264960 those pirates went on to film the pirates of penzance not really pirates just like cop rock not really cops power rangers you guessed it real life gay ninjas so we do have a clear cut winner again
7264961 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7264962 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7264963 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7264964 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7264965 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7264966 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7264967 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7264968 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7264969 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7264970 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7264971 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7264972 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7264973 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7264974 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters
7264975 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7264976 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7264977 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7264978 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7264979 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7264980 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7265017 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands
7265018 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7265019 prudence is required in somalia where the situation is complex and journalists and humanitarian aid workers are often abducted by militias acting with very diverse motives
7265020 we are deeply concerned that our son may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7265021 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somali authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7265022 we are awaiting advice from the somali government we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7265023 they were simply doing their job of reporting the story and presenting the plight of somali people to the world
7265024 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7265025 we are witnessing an overblown crisis of confidence and the effects of a global credit squeeze rather than a debt constrained slowdown
7265026 national income growth remains strong underpinned by the profits of the mining boom
7265027 the external sector is also poised for a recovery underpinned by sustained high demand for commodities and a significant depreciation in the australian dollar over 2009 and 2010 which will boost competitiveness
7265028 as renewed residential construction activity drives momentum in the economy and gross domestic product growth strengthens again the unemployment rate will drop back to current levels of close to 4 per cent by 2012
7265029 business investment is likely to show a rebound in the june quarter after a surprising drop in the march quarter but the focus will be on investment plans going forward and the likelihood is that they will have softened somewhat on the back of the recent slump in business confidence uncertainty about the economic outlook and slowing profit growth

7265053 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her
7265054 all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because obama lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process
7265055 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the raises these issues after obama is nominated
7265056 obamas grandmother on his fathers side half brother and half sister claim obama was born in kenya
7265057 reports reflect obamas mother went to kenya during her pregnancy however she was prevented from boarding a flight from kenya to hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight stanley ann dunham obama gave birth to obama in kenya after which she flew to hawaii and registered obamas birth
7265058 obamas mother failed to take the oath in order to regain her u s citizenship therefore obama would not have been able to regain his u s citizenship until he turned 18 years and after he took the oath of allegiance
7265059 since the oath of allegiance would have been entered in the records of the appropriate embassy legation consulate court or the attorney general if plaintiff is incorrect then obama should be able to produce in court a certified copy of the proceedings including a copy of the oath administered
7265060 obama traveled to pakistan using his indonesian passport at the time of travels to indonesia obama was 20 years old he was well aware he maintained his indonesia citizenship and failed to regain his united states citizenship even if obama maintained his united states citizenship which he failed to do he also carries citizenships in kenya and indonesia obama has divided loyalties with foreign countries thus obama carries multiple citizenships and is ineligible to run for president of the united states

7265071 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

7265172 iraq is a very wealthy country enormous oil reserves they can finance largely finance the reconstruction of their own country and i have no doubt that they will
7265173 ladies and gentlemen these are not assertions these are facts corroborated by many sources some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries
7265174 its hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post saddam iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of saddams security forces and his army hard to imagine
7265175 my belief is we will in fact be greeted as liberators
7265176 there is a lot of money to pay for this that doesnt have to be u s taxpayer money and it starts with the assets of the iraqi people we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
7265177 the united states is committed to helping iraq recover from the conflict but iraq will not require sustained aid

7265188 geschwindigkeit ist nicht alles aber ein wichtiger faktor beim kauf einer festplatte western digital ber cksichtigt wie die anderen festplattenhersteller auch das immer weiter steigende interesse an produkten welche mit den nicht endlos vorhandenen ressourcen sparsamer umgehen als bisher die caviar green baureihe tr gt diesem rechnung und man bietet die kapazit ten 500 750 und 1000 gb an wir testen hier die 750 gb version und pr fen was man von dieser erwarten kann
7265189 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
7265190 its like putting up a barrier weve all intermingled for years
7265191 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7265192 weve gotten more aircraft more vehicles more boats more atvs pretty much everything weve got more and weve got more people to man them
7265193 its so personal because its going to your hip its going to your pocket
7265194 a big goof up making us think that we were special obviously we aint as special as the media
7265195 in todays world the cellphone number is like a social security number and worth more than its weight in gold
7265196 youre going to be adding tens of thousands of consumers over the next six months because of this

7265200 this paper argues that recent and future changes in the employment of crown servant engineers will soon leave the mod unable to fulfil its intelligent customer remit and hence jeopardize airworthiness
7265201 engineering teams are punch drunk with additional requirements and there is evidence that they do not have the capacity to comply with existing regulations
7265202 it was pitch black no lights on in the rooms for most of the time they hung me up for two days my legs had swollen my wrists and hands had gone numb at one point i was chained to the rails for a fortnight the cia worked on people including me day and night plenty lost their minds i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors screaming their heads off
7265203 far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
7265204 the torturer has become like the pirate and the slave trader before him an enemy of all mankind
7265205 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7265206 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7265207 particularly on national security and foreign policy issues this stuff is second nature to joe
7265208 theres no research necessary hell have an informed opinion on everything that comes up i think hed be a good mentor and collaborator for barack
7265209 would be honored to run with or against john mccain
7265210 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
7265211 he fought back beyond respectability and the fact that hes here today in this position is testament to his mettle
7265212 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7265213 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7265214 its a commonsense response to the realities on the ground
7265215 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles

7265229 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7265230 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be
7265231 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7265232 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7265233 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7265234 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president
7265235 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states

7265237 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7265238 the media have been used to promote cigarettes and smoking through infamous advertising icons such as the marlboro man and joe camel and through tobacco images in hollywood movies
7265239 the tobacco industry tried for five years to shut down our successful truth youth smoking prevention campaign
7265240 ninety percent of adult smokers began before the age of 20 so cultivating new smokers is critical to big tobaccos business model to replace the more than 400 000 adults who die from tobacco annually with new smokers keeping young people from starting to smoke is a critical part of the equation if we want to make major strides toward saving lives bold effective counter marketing campaigns that reduce smoking rates and change social norms are proven effective in doing just that

7265244 in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
7265245 scored its biggest success last year when 10 eastern european countries endorsed the u s invasion known as the vilnius 10 they showed that europe is united by a commitment to end saddams bloody regime scheunemann said at the time
7265246 that the scheunemann georgia lobbying link had been brought to reporters attention by a public relations firm working for russia
7265247 the democratic national committee and the obama campaign have criticized mccain for his ties to scheunemann
7265248 in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
7265249 not only has mccain defended scheunemanns ties to the rogue republic but mccains campaign charged
7265250 they want to break down the white christian male power structure
7265251 we cant let the brown people take power the white man must rule
7265252 bush people are stating that russia is evil and wicked and wrong and bad and attacked georgia therefore s o and abkhazia were never independent but are part of georgia so that georgias starting the shooting match by shelling the s o city can be ignored
7265253 we arent racist we just dont want anyone that isnt the right kind of white in power
7265254 we have their phone numbers but we havent been able to reach them these are people we know and we are all hoping for their success
7265255 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
7265256 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower
7265257 mccains daddy admiral mccain is the one that covered up the israeli attack on the uss liberty that killed 34 american sailors the apple doesnt fall far from the tree except for cheney norman podhoretz and bill kristol mccain is americas greatest warmonger since mccain was born in panama and not a natural born citizen he is ineligible to be president anyway a law passed in 1937 conferred citizenship on children of american parents born in the canal zone after 1904 and it made john mccain a citizen just before his first birthday hence he is not a natural born citizen
7265258 but another offense for which mccain should be in prison is the fact mccain helped criminally loot the s amp ls of 100s of billions of dollars for himself and 4 other u
7265259 congress and the justice department should have no higher priority nothing deserves more attention than the possibility of ongoing national security failures and the proliferation of nuclear weapons with the connivance of corrupt senior government officials
7265260 i postulated that the real culprit of the 9 11 and anthrax attacks who engineered it all was thomas e enron white the former co chair of enron who subsequently became army secretary his dominate motive was cover his and others ass and assets was there a massive cover up white who was co chair again of enron was never indicated recently we are led to believe that bruce ivins was behind the anthrax attacks who worked out of the armys fort detrick biological center i wondered if there besides that was any direct connection between dr ivins and tom white
7265261 my veteran able danger colleagues and i share the common fear that the seeds of the next 9 11 attack have already been sewn and that much of the critical data that was harvested for the able danger project that could be used again now in the search for sleeper cells and others that matched the

7265263 the reuters story was partially confirmed for me when i was contacted by a deutsche bank employee who had survived the attacks by fleeing the wtc after the first plane hit according to the employee about five minutes before the attack the entire deutsche bank computer system had been taken over by something external that no one in the office recognized and every file was downloaded at lightening speed to an unknown location
7265264 the 2001 america anthrax attacks started exactly one week after 9 11 or sept
7265265 the anthrax that was sent was a very specialized form weaponized of the armys ames variety
7265266 there appears to be further corroboration regarding urban moving systems in a post february 8 2006 from investigative reporter wayne madsen
7265267 february 8 2006 wmr previously reported on the activities of a group of some 120 israeli
7265268 wmr can now report that a long serving member of the israeli intelligence service mossad has confirmed that the israeli art students were in fact part of a major israeli intelligence operation and that they were conducting surveillance of the activities of the 9 11 hijackers

7265282 the beauregard parish sheriffs office set up a narcotics checkpoint thursday night near starks louisiana
7265283 due to several complaints coming from the fields area the bpso put together a joint operation with the help of sheriff ricky moses and the deridder city police department the operations utilized several bpso deputies as well as the new drug interdiction team led by detectives dale sharp and greg hill seven police units total were used for the operation in addition to four other units performing regular patrols
7265284 if this really was a drug checkpoint it is clearly unconstitutional
7265285 if people went to court and fought it the evidence would be dismissed unless they consented to a search the sheriff down there must know checkpoints like this are constitutionally questionable but they can still ask people to consent and they know how to phrase that request in such a way that people are likely to consent
7265286 if they are stopping and searching people without probable cause that would appear to violate edmonds but we dont know for sure thats what they were doing
7265287 drug checkpoints are unconstitutional but these guys sound like they are straight up trying to do one
7265288 the narcotics checkpoints main objective was to get the narcotics off of the street
7265289 anything off of the streets is not in the hands of kids or anyone else
7265290 as more complaints come in we will be doing more
7265291 there just happened to be narcotics officers out there and it just so happened that we did our safety checkpoint in a certain area where they place is known for drug trafficking
7265292 it just so happened they were all in the right place at the right time
7265293 they are not constitutionally allowed to search you just because they set up a checkpoint you can say i know you guys are just doing your job but i have to go somewhere am i free to go if they search you without probable cause and without your consent and they find something youll get arrested but its highly likely the charges will be thrown out if not it could go all the way to the supreme court
7265294 if you see a warning that says drug checkpoint ahead dont throw your stuff out the window dont exit at the nearest ramp dont do a sudden u turn to get away because its not a drug checkpoint ahead but a ruse by police
7265295 the supreme court has held that drug checkpoints are an unconstitutional infringement on your fourth amendment rights but that doesnt mean police cant try to fool you at those fake drug checkpoints they will have officers waiting to see who throws what out his window or who suddenly exits to avoid the nonexistent checkpoint and they will find a reason to stop you

7265364 si les pitan los pasos que hacen la defensa con manos que hacen y pitan todo est claro que hubi semos podido ganar perfectamente hemos estado a tres puntos a pesar de los rbitros y si hubiesen estado bien seguro que hubi semos ganado pero claramente
7265365 si los rbitros hubiesen aplicado las reglas fiba hubi semos ganado pero estamos muy satisfechos por haber ganado la plata
7265366 era un partido para disfrutar y as ha sido hemos salido a la cancha sin miedo a nadie y no ten amos nada que perder creo que nos vamos muy satisfechos por el trabajo

7265378 anybody that knows anything about the marketing of corn knows that when you raise the price of corn you are going to create problems in all of the markets that use corn

7265380 if you think ethanol is such a loser technology dont you have to wonder what in the world the brazilians are doing apparently no one told them it doesnt work well
7265381 electric cars are not for everyone currently we can only meet the needs of 90 of the population
7265382 corn ethanol puts too big a strain on our corn production infrastructure
7265383 i know this is wrong what is going on here
7265384 0 78 million btu of fossil energy consumed for each 1 million btu of ethanol delivered compared to 1 23 million btu of fossil energy consumed for each 1 million btu of gasoline delivered
7265385 i e the total energy that would be required to produce a comparable product independent of the ethanol system
7265386 i saw a report on this subject a while back that also focused on the effect that this is having on impoverished mexicans because corn is such a staple in mexico driving up the price of corn is making it too expensive for many mexicans

7265393 i still think it was a mistake for the bbc to make fame academy it was too derivative its fine for itv to nick programme ideas from the bbc which they do all the time but not for the bbc to take from itv
7265394 the justification for getting large sums of public money is to innovate
7265395 being popular and getting ratings is not enough for the bbc its not to say that entertainment has no value but you must set out to give people something extra

7265400 ive never had a more frustrating summer we came fifth last season and a lot of clubs look at everton as the right way to do things weve not spent massively to finish fifth we have progressed every year this is the first summer where i feel i have not made any progression i need top players why is there a problem getting people in it is a bit of everything weve got all these injuries and i want to sign six or seven players before next week

7265404 we were searching for the perfect way to provide a needed service which we truly believe in
7265405 some of us feel that our pets are family and wish to provide a beautiful and meaningful farewell for them as well as providing complete closure for ourselves
7265406 our flights operate under the guidelines laid down by both the faa and state of california department of consumer affairs and our records are open to inspection
7265407 we want to thank you for your courteous and compassionate professionalism proceedings were handled with the utmost dignity and the spectacular site you selected for us exceeded what we expected
7265408 imagine being able to get up at dawn on a stormy sunday morning and photographing the maryland statehouse the u s naval academy chapel st annes episcopal church and the chesapeake bay with the sun peeking out of the clouds over the bay the scenery is startlingly beautiful
7265409 everyone at snapsports was beaming with pride to see us olympic athletes standing on the very products we manufacture right here in the usa
7265410 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7265411 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7265412 i dont know when i will fly back to germany
7265413 the team should fly back to nigeria first because the president wants to see us all
7265414 of course i am frustrated but when you lose a game it is not always the solution to buy
7265415 we did not create enough chances and have to look at why and how we can do it better i didnt feel we were into the game right from the start and you cant be like that
7265416 we had problems as well to win our early games last year but we did win them and it made things easier now we have to respond
7265417 we had 60 minutes to respond after fulham scored but we did not create a lot and i dont know why
7265418 but lets not make comparisons with this team and last seasons team because it is not a lot different if it is better only the future will tell us that
7265419 it was not excusable to concede a goal like that
7265420 ill always remember it but the most important thing was that it earned us a big three points
7265421 after last week starting with a defeat at hull we really needed something from this game
7265422 i would rather watch the fulham who go forward looking to play than the one hanging on but we can do both things
7265423 this is the same girl who wanted those crazy betsey johnson boots yesterday
7265424 mamady nearly got killed less than a year ago and almost lost his life he still has the scars on his hands to show that and it obviously affected him
7265425 he was in a terrible state when he came back over to us after the game against togo and there were issues about whether he would even play for his county again but he has come over that
7265426 so i was pleased he scored today mamady is a great player and works very hard and you bring him on with 20 minutes to go he can be a real handful and he was against villa
7265427 it is not just about goals with him its what he contributes around the team that gets him picked
7265428 he is such a big lad but such a lovely kid from a great family he is a real gem of a player
7265429 the first year in the premier league is all new and we hope that remains the case here that its new and fresh and everyone wants to enjoy it
7265430 i think we have some hunger and quality in the team and ricardo and liam were two who showed us that today
7265431 hopefully winning against villa will help us get maybe one or two other players to this squad we have got to develop as we go along
7265432 we know its going to be tough and up and down and have to make sure we stay as level as we can and not get too down when we lose or too elated when we win
7265433 it was a massive disappointment but we will bounce back from that result
7265434 on reflection on the whole game we should have taken something from it thats not to take anything away from stoke it was a great effort in front of their own crowd
7265435 we didnt play well in the first half but i thought that most of the second half belonged to us and we could never get our noses in front
7265436 we got the equaliser twice and just in the last minute or two whatever you do if you cant win the game make sure you dont lose it and unfortunately we contrived to do that
7265437 its really disappointing for all concerned its disappointing for the team and obviously for the supporters
7265438 but it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals
7265439 well come back again and i am still very positive because we only lost to a late goal
7265440 we are trying to get a few players in if its possible before the window closes waynes world
7265441 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognise the military backed constitution
7265442 the un envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
7265443 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7265444 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7265445 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7265446 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7265447 this is a new role for me i get to watch another guy play
7265448 he does have really good accuracy and he fits well into the scheme of things
7265449 nobody is going to hand you an opportunity to play
7265450 youre going to have to claw and scratch just to stay in the league
7265451 there is not a sense of relief by any means
7265452 youre excited about the season about the opportunity to go into a season were getting ready for san diego this week and arizona to start the season
7265453 you have to use it as motivation and continue to push yourself and get better
7265454 prove to people prove to myself that i can play well in this league
7265455 i came to work prepared i felt like i put a lot into this studied more than ive ever studied
7265456 its too far down the line when that time comes i will deal with it i am focused on the here and now
7265457 ser espa ol ya no es una excusa es una responsabilidad

7265460 anti gun politicians can no longer deny that the second amendment guarantees a fundamental right
7265461 our campaign to enact sensible gun laws will be undiminished by the supreme courts decision in the heller case
7265462 is far from a victory for gun owners it is already being used successfully to infringe upon the rights of gun owners across the country
7265463 a 22 year old man will face burglary charges once he is released from a jackson hospital police say mario lampkin was shot in the leg by the owner of a car who claimed lampkin was breaking into the vehicle after he was shot lampkin walked to the baptist medical center the shooting happened just before 6 a m today at an apartment complex in the 1300 block of n jefferson st the car owner was questioned and released that person has not been charged two other cars at the apartment complex also had been burglarized police say they suspect lampkin may be responsible for those too

7265484 the extent of the use of military force by the russian side appears seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from georgia and the picture conveyed by the media not inappropriately high

7265493 i think theres only one dream team in my opinion
7265494 theres teams that could be close to it but not like that one that team changed a lot of things in basketball and made a lot of young players want to play basketball and want to dedicate themselves to the sport
7265495 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that

7265507 we kregen daar veel verontwaardigde reacties op van duitsers het is over de hele wereld uitgezonden en het enige land waar men er problemen mee had is uitgerekend duitsland

7265514 beste atleten jullie zijn voorbeelden jullie hebben ons getoond dat het mogelijk is dat sport bij mekaar brengt de olympische gedachte leeft ook in de broeierige omknelling van van concurrerende landen die in conflict liggen
7265515 u denkt dat ons land enkel oude nonnetjes telt dat is niet langer het geval want in ons land leven vandaag de dag heel wat jonge nonnetjes afkomstig uit andere landen er zijn zusters afkomstig uit afrika en latijns amerika die zeer mooi zijn vooral de braziliaanse
7265516 de wedstrijd wil duidelijk maken dat er nog andere schoonheid bestaat dan die die men op televisie toont er is ook de schoonheid van de ziel en van het hart

7265530 some bullying and brazen countries and their worthless followers wanted to impose their will on the but the president and the government have stood up to their excessive demands and moved forward
7265531 pursuing an aggressive spirit toward world bullies is a manifestation of the governments loyalty to revolutionary slogans and discourse
7265532 we cant be satisfied with the way the country is being administered a country with abundant resources should not have gas cuts in winter and electricity cuts in summer or have people spending hours in line at
7265533 khameneis comment is an open support for ahmadinejad his backing of ahmadinejad is also an answer to growing criticism of the government
7265534 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going
7265535 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7265536 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7265537 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7265538 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7265539 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
7265540 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

7265573 its very hard to get it to be the primary issue particularly for politicians who are making budget decisions because they are not getting the same pressure about mental health as they get about cancer and coronary disease and diabetes
7265574 we working from the opportunity we have within government organizations such as the national association and the nova scotia association and other groups and all of us collectively need to be doing something much more significant to make this a burning bridge issue for decision makers
7265575 i think one of the challenges around mental illness is that its unique properties include affecting our thinking our moods and our behaviour the very dimensions that define us as individuals
7265576 that makes it a lot tougher to separate the illness from the person
7265577 the reality of mental illness its mundane reality is virtually never depicted
7265578 the same applies to the newspapers because somebody recovering from mental illness or somebody simply making a great adaptation to mental illness is about as newsworthy as a plane landing safely at the airport

7265580 i think that other parents like the same things that i like about the books they are soft and colorful for babies and toddlers they fit nicely in a diaper bag and arent really bulky to carry around if you are on the go they are educational in order to also make them safe they are made of only felt and thread i dont use any beads or buttons in the books so that there is no danger of chocking on the small parts i also make sure that all pieces are sewn securely
7265581 i think its also important when reading with babies and toddlers to let them set the pace if they want to stop and look at a picture or go backwards in a book thats okay

7265622 its a construction that reality is predicated upon the operations of logic
7265623 but god put his love on the line for us by offering his son in sacrifice death while we were of no use whatever to him
7265624 the ecb board support the decision of the icc to postpone the champions trophy until october 2009
7265625 the ecb board made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7265626 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday these concerns were shared by four other competing countries at yesterdays teleconference
7265627 the ecb board recognise the outstanding efforts of the pakistan cricket board in attempting to mitigate the risks surrounding the champions trophy tournament and i will be meeting with the incoming chairman of the pcb once an appointment is made to discuss ways that our two boards can work together in the future
7265628 there was a unanimity to postpone the event until october next year appeasement wasnt part of the meeting at all
7265629 the pakistan cricket board have been extremely reasonable about the whole subject and they worked jolly hard to try to give comfort to the member boards of the teams touring that the place would be safe and secure
7265630 unfortunately five of the participating nations found it impossible to send their teams to pakistan because of safety and security concerns
7265631 voting was totally in favour of the postponement until october of next year
7265632 india were quite influential in persuading some other nations that was the right course of action
7265633 had we decided a month ago im sure the tournament would be taking place in sri lanka
7265634 but the amount of time its taken for the participating nations to come to their decision not to attend has reduced the time between today and start of tournament
7265635 it was just impossible to relocate and stage a world class tournament
7265636 were going to meet in the middle of september in dubai to consider the consequences of todays decision
7265637 every one of our members wish to ensure the icc champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7265638 todays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7265639 why not go out on a limb thats where the fruit is
7265640 i may disagree with what you have to say but i shall defend to the death your right to say it
7265641 ah just some games how does that matter we are becoming the worlds top economy soon we are a power to reckon with in software in science and technology
7265642 he is one of these guys that believe hes untouchable due to the fact that he does have some money
7265643 you cant say im a colton city crip from my entertainment
7265644 i dont have to see no 12 jurors but im just guilty like that
7265645 you got to ride around with pistols or risk getting gunned down
7265646 i done got shot been shot at done the shooting
7265647 he straddles this line and tries to keep enough street credibility yet seem like hes in legitimate business
7265648 hes not a rapper trying to be a gangster hes a gangster trying to be a rapper
7265649 that means they were going to the store the people there are happy to see me come from nothing and go to something and i try to help them anyway i can
7265650 he perpetuates the myth that that the arbor terrace is known in the street as the zoo
7265651 this enhances the gangs identity and perpetuates the lore that the gang owns the place and does what it wants there
7265652 but i dont know what theyve been doing after they leave my business
7265653 ni as said hova was over such dummies even if i fell id land on a bunch of money
7265654 he goes up to accept the award for best video for ugk feat
7265655 then barber grabs the mic again seriously when i see him dont fuckin speak to me
7265656 that he is not recognized and just taken for granted as a street musician still i dont think that if hes really good hes going to go unnoticed hed get a larger audience in europe but okay out of 1 000 people my guess is there might be 35 or 40 who will recognize the quality for what it is maybe 75 to 100 will stop and spend some time listening
7265657 im thinking that i could do a tour where id play kreislers music
7265658 does nothing less than tell human beings why they bother to live
7265659 if you shaved off a millimeter of wood at any point it would totally imbalance the sound
7265660 thats his original varnish people attribute aspects of the sound to the varnish each maker had his own secret formula
7265661 not just one of the greatest pieces of music ever written but one of the greatest achievements of any man in history its a spiritually powerful piece emotionally powerful structurally perfect plus it was written for a solo violin so i wont be cheating with some half assed version
7265662 on one stave for a small instrument the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings if i imagined that i could have created even conceived the piece i am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind
7265663 i was just concentrating on playing the music i wasnt really watching what was happening around me
7265664 when you play a violin piece you are a storyteller and youre telling a story
7265665 it was a strange feeling that people were actually ah
7265666 at a music hall ill get upset if someone coughs or if someones cellphone goes off but here my expectations quickly diminished i started to appreciate any acknowledgment even a slight glance up i was oddly grateful when someone threw in a dollar instead of change
7265667 you are already validated i have no sense that i need to be accepted im already accepted here there was this thought what if they dont like me what if they resent my presence
7265668 lets say i took one of our more abstract masterpieces say an ellsworth kelly and removed it from its frame marched it down the 52 steps that people walk up to get to the national gallery past the giant columns and brought it into a restaurant
7265669 doesnt mean heading to work focusing on your report to the boss maybe your shoes dont fit right
7265670 forecast spending for the next month if you have x dollars where will it go that sort of thing
7265671 where it moves from a darker minor key into a major key
7265672 i think this is due to the fact that i never forced devotion in myself and never compose hymns or prayers of that kind unless it overcomes me unawares but then it is usually the right and true devotion
7265673 i had an 8 30 training class and first i had to rush evvie off to his teacher then rush back to work then to the training facility in the basement
7265674 and my son was intrigued he wanted to pull over and listen but i was rushed for time
7265675 you could tell in one second that this guy was good that he was clearly a professional
7265676 well that man was feeling it that man was moving moving into the sound
7265677 just a guy trying to make a couple of bucks
7265678 yeah but youre going to have to pay a lot to hear him
7265679 im surprised at the number of people who dont pay attention at all as if im invisible because you know what im makin a lot of noise
7265680 but nothing about him struck me as much of anything
7265681 i was just trying to figure out what he was doing there how does this work for him can he make much money would it be better to start with some money in the case or for it to be empty so people feel sorry for you i was analyzing it financially
7265682 im a lawyer in labor relations with the united states postal service i just negotiated a national contract
7265683 my father told me never to wear a suit with your shoes not cleaned and shined
7265684 he was pretty good that guy it was the first time i didnt call the police
7265685 if something like this happened in brazil everyone would stand around to see not here
7265686 couple of years ago a homeless guy died right there he just lay down there and died the police came an ambulance came and no one even stopped to see or slowed down to look
7265687 people walk up the escalator they look straight ahead mind your own business eyes forward everyone is stressed do you know what i mean
7265688 there was a musician playing at the top of the escalator at lenfant plaza
7265689 this was a superb violinist ive never heard anyone of that caliber he was technically proficient with very good phrasing he had a good fiddle too with a big lush sound i walked a distance away to hear him i didnt want to be intrusive on his space
7265690 really it was that kind of experience it was a treat just a brilliant incredible way to start the day
7265691 yeah other people just were not getting it it just wasnt registering that was baffling to me
7265692 no if you love something but choose not to do it professionally its not a waste because you know you still have it you have it forever
7265693 it was the most astonishing thing ive ever seen in washington
7265694 joshua bell was standing there playing at rush hour and people were not stopping and not even looking and some were flipping quarters at him quarters i wouldnt do that to anybody i was thinking omigosh what kind of a city do i live in that this could happen
7265695 thats not so bad considering thats 40 bucks an hour i could make an okay living doing this and i wouldnt have to pay an agent
7265696 voor hen is het net zo belangrijk dat ze weten wat de citotoets inhoudt dan gaan ze jou misschien niet meer onnodig zenuwachtig maken of je allerlei dwaze vragen over de toets stellen

7265711 after such a bad result in hungary we come to a new track for everyone and did a fantastic job we prepared the car well on friday and saturday morning and chose the right tyres which i think was pretty difficult especially in qualifying but i think we did a perfect job on that to make pole position and won the race which is more than i could ask for
7265712 the start was just great and ive been doing great starts all season
7265713 the first stint was very good and i saw lewis fighting but i was pulling away a couple of tenths every lap we won the race in the second stint as the car was perfect and the gap was just increasing
7265714 i think it wasnt very clever from adrians side he needs to let me by as he saw me coming and i had to back off and lost a lot of time i stopped behind him and we left together we were side by side and i was the leader and he was lapped it was quite narrow there and i decided not to take any risk so i backed off

7265795 i think i had a chance to get the gold

7265805 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60

7265822 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7265823 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7265824 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7265825 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7265826 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7265827 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7265828 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7265829 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards

7265831 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing

7265835 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7265836 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7265837 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7265838 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7265839 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7265840 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7265841 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7265842 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7265843 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7265844 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7265845 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7265846 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7265847 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll

7265857 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7265858 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7265859 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7265860 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7265861 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7265862 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7265863 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7265864 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7265865 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7265866 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7265867 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7265868 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7265869 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7265870 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7265871 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7265872 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7265873 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7265874 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7265875 im guessing most players didnt play to their level because of the heat

7265882 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7265883 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7265884 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7265885 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7265886 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7265887 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7265888 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7265889 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7265890 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7265891 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7265892 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7265893 the church profoundly misses the point of peer participation the church controls the content and programs acts autonomously competes with other churches operates through a pecking order of hierarchy and resists feedback collaboration or congregational innovation
7265894 we want contexts for social networking and a radical shift away from the current activity machine
7265895 we believe the bible is inspired plus we believe our leadership is inspired
7265896 we believe the bible is inspired plus we believe this other book of ours

7265955 approximately 50 showed very little if any signs of impairment other than the odour of alcohol on their breath
7265956 many of them were very surprised to see fail come up on the roadside device
7265957 just because you think you are not impaired doesnt mean you are not if you have to think about it you probably are
7265958 if you have to ask yourself should i be driving you probably shouldnt
7265959 you only have to be halfway to exceeding the legal limit
7265960 for some people that could be as little as a couple of beers someone in a bar who consumes three or four drinks over two to three hours should be wary of driving
7265961 for a lot of people to lose the right to drive could be devastating
7265962 but being arrested and charged is a better option than hurting yourself or someone else

7265974 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression

7266026 we cannot go beyond what the prime minister has told in parliament he has given assurance to parliament on what india can accept and what it cannot accept
7266027 there are some concerns these have to be addressed however what kind of changes are there remains to be seen
7266028 this was expected and it is not surprising india always expected that the nsg process will take some time i am sure that the primary responsibility of getting us the waiver is that of the united states of america i am confident that nsg will see india as a special case and we cannot be equated with other countries we are confident that we will be able to get the waiver
7266029 we have our position those countries have their position the united states cannot impose its will it nsg is a democratic institution it has to work through consensus

7266032 i need to buy top players to challenge the top teams and that costs big money
7266033 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure it is going to happen
7266034 ive never had a more frustrating summer we came fifth last season and a lot of clubs look at everton as the right way to do things
7266035 weve not spent massively to finish fifth we have progressed every year
7266036 this is the first summer where i feel i have not made any progression
7266037 i dont need to buy mid premier league players i need top players
7266038 why is there a problem getting people in it is a bit of everything weve got all these injuries and i want to sign six or seven players before next week
7266039 west brom will feel they could have got something from the game but the premier league is a cruel league
7266040 you have got to score when you get opportunities but we hung in there and took the couple we had
7266041 for this team of ours to win any premier league game at the moment is a credit to them
7266042 we had plenty of good play and we controlled the game for a long time
7266043 but that spell of two goals in such a short time maybe thats the difference at this level
7266044 weve shown we can compete at this level though and we should have no fears
7266045 of course it has seeped through to the players theyre not daft my jobs to not let them down and at the moment im letting them down
7266046 if anyone thinks that supporting our elite athletes isnt worthwhile giving young australians the opportunity to optimise their performance to compete on the world stage have a look at these guys
7266047 just as in any field of endeavour we should be giving them the opportunity to excel in sport
7266048 id put it in the context of our defence budget what it costs for a frigate
7266049 id weigh it up very very much against what were spending on health
7266050 this is a way of motivating our nation giving young people self confidence encouraging young people to take up sport and take greater care of their bodies
7266051 we are on the same page as the federal government the prime minister understands the importance of our olympic team and other international teams to the reputation of australia
7266052 hes able to reflect in the glory of it when hes overseas
7266053 im sure a lot was achieved by him here in beijing by sitting behind george bush at the swimming and meeting with other world leaders achieved as much as at any round table
7266054 part of australias global standing lies in the fact that we have such an enormously competitive nation on the international field of sporting endeavour
7266055 there needs to be more funding for talent identification for coaching for the sports science and medical backup and for the administration
7266056 if were going to be putting a figure to government to enable us to stay in the top five in london then the government should be ensuring that the sports have got the appropriate management at the top to manage that money
7266057 i hope we dont ever get to a stage where they are not the recipients of appropriate funding in favour of just the multi medal sports
7266058 we are keeping a close watch since the incident took place
7266059 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
7266060 went to law school on a full academic scholarship the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship
7266061 i did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school and my recollection of this was inacurate
7266062 i graduated from the university of delaware with a double major in history and political science
7266063 mr biden received a single b a in history and political science
7266064 with regard to my being the outstanding student in the political science department
7266065 my name was put up for that award by david ingersoll who is still at the university of delaware
7266066 my recollection is and id have to confirm this but i dont recall paying any money to go to law school
7266067 arranged for my first years room and board by placing me as an assitant resident adviser in the undergraduate school

7266073 one of ours certainly is we cant produce the same revenues that other teams in our division can
7266074 we feel strongly that payrolls dont decide the standings talent does
7266075 the one buzzword weve talked about a lot the last couple years is being opportunistic
7266076 we have to react to the industry for us to compete in this division and be able to build a team to compete not only in 2008 but for many years we almost have to run a different direction from the industry
7266077 im biased but i feel like weve got great balance up and down our lineup
7266078 were built on pitching and defense which for the most part shows up every night
7266079 were definitely going to get to a point down the road where were not going to be able to keep everyone
7266080 its just a fact of life that in the division were competing in we dont have the same resources as those teams and we never will we cant pretend to be like them and operate like them
7266081 theres been a lot of naysayers and its hard to fault them with our history
7266082 but it has inspired the guys in our clubhouse and they kind of have this us against the world mentality
7266083 finally i have found you ive been waiting for you for years i just want you to know that me and my sister stayed together im sorry i left you and i never got the chance to thank you for your bravery and help so thank you
7266084 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7266085 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7266086 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno

7266088 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno

7266090 mentre lui ti da qualche dettaglio e la tua fantasia corre facendosi gi un quadro
7266091 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno che stringono facendo scivolare lacrime
7266092 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7266093 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
7266094 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
7266095 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
7266096 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
7266097 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
7266098 the problem is that the higher the burden of taxation the less opportunity there is for growth
7266099 if you want to get further growth then the state has got to take less from people in tax
7266100 as you reduce the levels of taxation you will get growth
7266101 just as the country is having to tighten its belt clearly we are going to have to look at priorities for public expenditure
7266102 we have reached the limits and in my view we have got to make economies
7266103 i think we have reached the end of the road the british people are well ahead of the politicians on this and know that the money is not being spent wisely
7266104 it is up to the leadership of the conservative party how they present these things
7266105 but the facts of life are if you allow public expenditure to grow more rapidly peoples living standards will continue to fall and our ability to recover will diminish
7266106 therefore we need to do in government what people are doing in their business and private lives which is to cut out cloth
7266107 obviously a conservative administration will have to undertake a policy of economic recovery
7266108 im afraid its going to get worse before it gets better
7266109 the situation now is the result of this governments overspending overborrowing and overtaxing
7266110 there are areas where you could stop spending on unnecessary programmes which will start to relieve pressure we can cut back on things
7266111 david cameron and george osborne have already promised more than 10 billion in unfunded tax pledges and have welcomed the redwood and forsyth reports advocating even more unfunded tax cuts
7266112 but at the same time the conservative frontbench keep making massive extra spending promises
7266113 you said i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is

7266133 we need to take a bolder policy agenda to meet peoples material concerns and thats why this policy resonates across the social spectrum
7266134 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that
7266135 politically we also have to contrast that with the tories
7266136 cameron has fashioned a new conservative language but his attachment to the market means he cant actually make britain a fairer society he can only talk about it
7266137 this poll vindicates what wed thought all along the compass windfall tax policy is both radical and popular just the sort of measure the government needs if it is to win back voters
7266138 as millions of britons struggle to make ends meet the energy and oil companies struggle with a different challenge what to do with all their windfall profits
7266139 we get record price rises and they get record profits this has got to stop and government must intervene
7266140 its right that some of those undeserved profits are used to help people pay their bills this winter and to help insulate homes for future winters thats why our policy for a sensible one off windfall tax is right
7266141 it cannot be the mere training to certain tricks it cannot be even the furnishing with abundant knowledge it must be nothing less than the kneading and tempering of a mans whole nature till it becomes of such a consistency and quality as to be capable of transmission this is the largeness of the preachers culture
7266142 the physical equipment was symbol of his soul and the rush of his speech was typical of those mental moral and spiritual energies that were fused into unity and came forth in a stream of fiery intensity

7266145 ah wait by and by the life will flag the senses will grow dull the tastes will stupefy the enterprise will flicker out and the days come in which your soul will say i have no pleasure in them just wait for that then your pride will go too and then you will need and seek your god
7266146 well i will wait until that losing day comes before i worry
7266147 except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god

7266169 i remember i remember summers that felt like dreams always passing by on fast forward days that ran together string by string because we always did the same thing i remember hanging out together because there was nothing else to do sitting there fighting over sodas amp never doing anything interesting we just loved to be around eachother out past curfew amp hoping to god we wouldnt get caught long walks at two in the afternoon and two in the morning going to the store amp buying random things acting crazy amp stupid in public just to see what people would say sitting on front porches watching sunsets amp wondering what we would do with our lives we acted like we owned this town and in some ways i think we did busting on eachother for stupid little things and laughing when we got mad about it singing like no one could hear us even though we were terrible at it not caring what people thought because all that mattered was us passing time by telling stories amp playing stupid games long nights that turned into early mornings falling asleep on the floor around eachother watching movies and embracing the fact that we had no cares and no worries because nothing else mattered we never gave up amp we held onto the idea that wed always have eachother that no one could take the passion away from us that there was something inside of us we mightve actually cared about eachother i could be wrong but i dare you to prove it it was the climax of our lives amp we hever had a thought in our minds that it would end it was the closest thing to hapiness wed ever known it was the peak of our high how we stood together and then we fell apart

7266277 the work has improved the markets have opened iraqi traders are dealing with other companies directly
7266278 it is the first time in six conferences we are talking about actual projects before we were always discussing terrorism and sectarianism
7266279 we are at the beginning we would like to establish the good basics to start and actually there are some plans started but there are still few
7266280 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq
7266281 that accusation would come as little surprise to wholesaler sudani you
7266282 the need to deal with things calmly away from the escalation which will not serve all parties and that he is seeking a compromise in which the law is balanced conditions for success and meet the aspirations of the parties concerned
7266283 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
7266284 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
7266285 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
7266286 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
7266287 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
7266288 oil and gas and oil ministry and the national oil company oil revenues distribution law for all regions and governorates irregular territory
7266289 so far not received but parliament a draft law of oil and gas which reached four without supplements that were installed in the law on february 15 and approved by the minister of oil
7266290 supplements are distributed four separate oil fields producing and non productive and undiscovered and that so far we have not received a response from the government before any law depends on the fate of other laws
7266291 there is no time ceiling for passing laws and the council of ministers makhoul submit draft laws to parliament
7266292 he called on the ministry of oil to conclude contracts with foreign companies short term service contracts a year or two for the implementation of projects to develop oil fields
7266293 everyone has to believe that election is very important and necessary and has to be held in a fair transparent manner in order to help sustain stability through expanding political participation
7266294 these organizations have pursued a partisan not a national framework
7266295 i think resolving the big issues like the hydrocarbons law in a way that gives sunnis the impression that their voice is heard thats going to be important
7266296 now the willingness of sunni cabinet members who have resigned to now return to have those cabinet seats filled and a sense that the sunnis are going to participate aggressively in the upcoming elections that again is i think a sign of progress
7266297 we have reached a conclusion that we should take off three zeroes from the current iraqi dinar banknotes
7266298 the process is progressing and we have taken some steps

7266414 my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame my victories or achievements but wholly lean on jesus name
7266415 i first met w d frazee in the late 1960s i was a youth pastor in hartford connecticut our senior pastor pastor o j mills invited pastor frazee to come and hold a series of meetings in our church the messages deeply moved me they were spiritual biblical and life changing i watched as people came forward and gave their hearts to the lord and knelt at the altar weeping i listened as others gave testimonies of what christ had done in their lives and how their lives were changed
7266416 elder frazees preaching was sincere he was in earnest he was a man on a mission and when i listened to him preach i sensed that his messages came from the almighty throne room of god i knew he had been on his knees and that god had impacted his mind his messages were in contrast to some of the surface shallow and superficial messages that we so often hear these messages were deep they were biblical and they were moving they helped to shape my concept of preaching over thirty years ago
7266417 there are hundreds of recordings of elder frazees sermons these sermons will be a mighty powerful influence in your own life it is our prayer that god does something through you to you and with you and for you as you listen to these sermons it is our prayer that although elder frazees voice has been silenced god will speak again through these messages from the past
7266418 i will never forget the series of sermons that elder frazee gave at camp meeting in florida his sermons were deeply moving and touched the heart when he had finished his last sermon on friday morning instead of meeting the people as many speakers do he simply walked away and i saw him no more this left the full impact of his message in my heart i may have wanted to thank him but he wasnt there to thank so i could only thank god which i am sure was the real goal of the messages that we had heard during the week
7266419 i was exposed to brother frazee through ransom and reunion and then i ran into some old dusty tapes he wasnt the kind of preacher i was used to he spoke softly and slowly i am impressed that his message was so potent that it needed no help that wisdom should not be buried im a young gospel worker that benefits from that treasure surely there are more out there in the lords vineyard just like me
7266420 the good lord arranged to have hundreds of elder w d frazees sermons and classes tape recorded i have heard over 100 of these and can recommend them to any religious person adventist other christian moslem etc a project to make these studies widely available will be a credit to any organization sponsoring it
7266421 elder frazee had a unique ability to balance spiritual truth with practical ministry his written materials and taped sermons have been a blessing to me as i have combined medical work with preaching and other aspects of spiritual ministry i believe giving greater visibility to his work would be a blessing to all those in our church who long for a deeper experience in christian ministry
7266422 frazees messages were a great blessing to my life as they were right to some of the points i normally struggle with such as trying to accomplish more than i can losing sight of the real priorities missing the truth about gods need of me and so on his messages brought so many insights to my ministry that calling peoples attention to the gospel became easier the simplicity and practical applications of the messages were a mark that changed my life and ministry
7266423 the ministry of w d frazee has done more to ground and establish me than anyone else on this earth i never had the pleasure to meet him but i have been richly blessed by him through his sermon tapes it has been a great resource for me in counseling my congregation and in reaching both atheists and those of other denominations with over 1500 sermons recorded there is counsel on almost every subject imaginable for the christian walk placing these sermons on cd rom will be a tremendous benefit to the ministers and lay people of the seventh day adventist church
7266424 i met elder frazee many years ago as a new adventist i was about to leave the church and he had a profound influence on me in an understanding of the uniqueness of the sda message and our part in end time events i have come across many people who have been helped through his ministry and so i believe that this cd rom could profoundly help many more with an understanding of this end time message and that it will help prepare a people to give the loud cry and prepare us for jesus to come
7266425 i was a student of w d frazees over 40 years ago the classes i received from him have helped me in so many ways wherever ive gone in the world i really think the cd rom will be a great help to so many people it will be a great use to me in my ministry to have his studies spiritual insights and sermons in written form for me to draw from
7266426 elder frazee is the most practical preacher ive ever listened to he could find gold in gods word where others saw only grey granite he could then refine that gold into user friendly easy to apply life changing truth
7266427 i was first introduced to elder frazees messages in 1997 while taking the medical missionary training at wildwood lifestyle center in georgia since then i have listened to many of his tapes on various topics i have been greatly blessed by the messages i believe they are a great help to spiritual growth as well as for witnessing it will certainly be great help if all of elder frazees messages are made available to many people in the adventist church it could be a great help to training centers like ours it is my prayer that god will open the way towards it

7266456 ministers should stand erect and speak slowly firmly and distinctly taking a full inspiration of air at every sentence and throwing out the words by exercising the abdominal muscles
7266457 in my younger days i used to talk too loud the lord has shown me that i could not make the proper impression upon the people by getting the voice to an unnatural pitch then christ was presented before me and his manner of talking and there was a sweet melody in his voice his voice in a slow calm manner reached those who listened and his words penetrated their hearts and they were able to catch on to what he said before the next sentence was spoken some seem to think they must race right straight along or else they will lose the inspiration and the people will lose the inspiration if that is inspiration let them lose it and the sooner the better
7266458 all created things testify to his power his wisdom his love
7266459 how could i who have been considered an educated man be so totally ignorant of the fact that trees have buds in the winter
7266460 we dont know why it works that way it just does
7266461 who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this
7266462 i will never forget the series of sermons that elder frazee gave at camp meeting in florida his sermons were deeply moving and touched the heart when he had finished his last sermon on friday morning instead of meeting the people as many speakers do he simply walked away and i saw him no more this left the full impact of his message in my heart i may have wanted to thank him but he wasnt there to thank so i could only thank god which i am sure was the goal of the messages that we had heard during the week
7266463 god leads his people on step by step he brings them up to different points calculated to reveal what is in the heart
7266464 where did we come from and where are we going
7266465 happiness is never to be found by seeking for it

7266490 we needed it at this point a lot of the guys right behind me finished in the top 10 also we gained a little bit on a couple guys in front of us but this is what we needed
7266491 all we can ask for is a top three finish and if we do that its going to work itself out in three races but we cant help how good or bad they run
7266492 weve known all year that if we do what we need to do we can make the chase
7266493 this weekend for instance we kind of stepped on our toes on friday and we kind of rebounded tonight weve just got to watch our mistakes and cant cost us too many spots early in the weekend it makes for a long 500 laps on saturday
7266494 its a relief to get a top 10 finish and a finish on the lead lap here at bristol after going to the back twice after having some left front fender damage and having to go back on a pit stop and make some adjustments
7266495 i wish we would have had a little bit of track position there toward the middle part i felt like we had a good car to contend for a top 10 finish but we just did the best we could and everything will take care of itself
7266496 i always want to win but crew chief todd berrier and everybody did a great job
7266497 the car was off at the beginning good thing we qualified good we were just way too loose and we got that fixed and came back and made a good night of it
7266498 i drive with the tractor to yata to bring water if the soldiers are nice they let me pass if not i have to travel three hours in the fields on a route that bypasses the checkpoint it all depends on the type of soldier at the checkpoint
7266499 we were born in caves and were used to a hard life we have no problem we became used to it already from our parents and i also force my children to become accustomed to our hard life only the settlers disrupt our lives they are destroying our lives we grew up with this we liked this situation we like to be with nature in difficult conditions except for the settlers who have inhabited our lands they have disrupted things all we want is to continue our lives thats all and we hope that the settlers will stop causing us problems theyre interrupting our lives
7266500 when i come to the police station they see me and close the gate i waste my entire day there if i go to file a complaint i need to spend an entire day in the sun thats what happened the last time i stood there tossed outside like a dog i push the buttons speak on the intercom they tell me ill be admitted right away and nothing happens
7266501 i had arrived there at 10 a m and it took me until 5 30 p m before i could file the complaint even when i had already done so i felt that the policemen were not receiving me properly and the investigator was not writing down what i said
7266502 they began to shoot those paint bombs at our children and our children got scared and fled
7266503 i wanted to approach to ask them why are you stealing our sheep but they are very fanatic people and they told me to leave the place immediately i didnt see bilal or the sheep where was bilal where were the sheep i was afraid i phoned the emergency number 100 they didnt answer it started to get dark were in the dark alone theyre cursing and shouting and im worried about my son and the sheep
7266504 i got the children used to not being afraid and i hope that it wont happen again i dont want to say that all of beit yatir is like that not everyone in the settlement is a thief and wicked its important to say that only a few and especially the one in the picture in recent months its become worse and theyve started to make a lot of trouble for us i feel it they try to steal sheep they try to run over sheep they throw stones at night and scare my children
7266505 every time it revolves boom its like an explosion at night

7266509 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7266510 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7266511 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7266512 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7266513 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7266514 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7266515 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7266516 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7266517 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time

7266531 my idea was to write catchy pop songs with big hooks and dress them up in a cutting edge electronic production
7266532 i love the sound of fatboy slim and the crystal method and artists like that and i wanted my songs to have the same excitement and edge production wise but as i am a musician and not a dj it was important to me to create my own samples rather than search through the old record bin to find them i would record a slew of guitar riffs bass lines live drums vocals etc and then cut them up re sample filter and tweak the crap out them i then used those samples to build the production
7266533 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7266534 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification

7266542 per chi invece non fosse interessato a seguire i dibattiti e le conferenze un
7266543 we are dismayed at the decision by the national institute of health and clinical excellence nice on the rationing of drugs for patients with advanced kidney cancer
7266544 once again nice has shown how poorly it assesses new cancer treatments
7266545 its economic formulae are simply not suitable for addressing cost effectiveness in this area of medicine
7266546 mean survivals obscure the fact that some patients will obtain prolonged benefit from these drugs
7266547 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7266548 there are all sorts of evidence that are most unsatisfactory
7266549 the picture is not a happy one we would like this inquest reopened so that in this very important case no stone is left unturned
7266550 as specialist medical professionals we do not consider the evidence given at the hutton inquiry has demonstrated that dr kelly committed suicide
7266551 we find it difficult to accept that a cut such as the one described could result in death it is very unlikely that this injury would have been fatal
7266552 because the case was so high profile i imagined that the autopsy and inquest would be carried out to the highest standard that our state could muster
7266553 but the more i thought about it the less certain i became that he could have died from a cut to the left wrist
7266554 arteries in the wrist are of matchstick thickness and severing them does not lead to life threatening blood loss
7266555 when the artery is completely transected as apparently happened in this case it retracts and the blood begins to clot this limits the blood loss
7266556 this is just one of several i have received to this effect
7266557 i hope to take any views into account on this matter
7266558 i expect to have a hearing in march at which i will make my ruling
7266559 i told police that the fact he was found dead in the woods to me was not surprising
7266560 the fact they said he committed suicide was his job was dangerous he knew it could cost him his life he got death threats
7266561 nobody in government came out of this episode with any credit or integrity yet three years after the hutton inquiry the principal players in the drama of the death of david kelly those who backed the government or cravenly caved in to no10s demands have prospered handsomely
7266562 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7266563 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7266564 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7266565 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7266566 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7266567 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7266568 ill let mary schweitzer speak for herself and allow the people to decide flesh and blood from a 65 million year old dinosaur dragon thats still funny but you have to ask yourself why this isnt paraded around like their mighty date testing crap could be the people would see the man behind the curtain
7266569 if you cant trust the first words of the bible gen 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
7266570 oh come on you guys believe all life sprang up from a rock a rock that is faith for ya what a maroon
7266571 they recently dated the new dome on top the volcano want to know how old the tests say 340 000 to 2 8 million years not only is that wrong but look at that margin not only is the error off by a multiple of 100 000 28 years 2 800 000 years but the gap between the readings is nearly 2 5 million years but that is a small camel to swallow for the camel swallowing long earth agers it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that the radiometric indicators used by evolutionists to get their great ages of the earth can be off by as much as a factor of 1 billion due to a billion fold acceleration of beta decay add to that the known errors in radiocarbon dating and you have an earth age that is dead center on the 6000 year age indicated by the genealogies in genesis and subsequent recorded histories in the tanakh so a 100 000 fold error is a small pill to swallow for these religious evolutionist nuts who have already swallowed a camel they have always gone on blind faith without any genuine bona fide evidence to support it
7266572 johnny has been as lost as a frog in a hailstorm from the very beginning of this discussion
7266573 and who made you the creator of the english language
7266574 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7266575 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7266576 ahh johhny so full of arogance heres what god says about people like you rom 1 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
7266577 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7266578 ignore aks arguments havent ignored any theres just no challenge to them he apparently ran out of evo proof and had to attack the bible i think his head burst after the massive amount of replys that came in god will always call some one to defend his word i wont respond to the last comment i dont swing that way johhny
7266579 case in point coelacanth fish the great and mighty transitional fossil
7266580 heres a prediction for ya romans 1 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen 26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 30 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 31 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful 32 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
7266581 what a maroon that has already been done except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment the testing lab was not told in advance where the rock came from so they could not fake the results to agree with how old they thought the rock was choke on it
7266582 hey ma meatloaf what is she doing i never know what shes doing
7266583 she will be released tomorrow our consul spoke to the mfa ministry of foreign affairs
7266584 i know how to enter the us open and what it takes to win thats a huge advantage i have
7266585 i come here as the defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7266586 i believe it is an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7266587 rafa has never been beyond the fourth round so that is definitely the advantage that i carry
7266588 for five years i was expected to win every tournament
7266589 so now it changes a little bit rafa will feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7266590 i tried to save a lot of energy at the beginning of the year so i would get through the entire season without a problem

7266592 it is just a matter of winning a lot of matches in a row i really feel like this is going to happen at the us open
7266593 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7266594 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7266595 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams

7266598 restrict oversized bags for daytime only as they look cool and chic but to make a statement carry a clutch in the evening

7266600 fashion for me is more about fusion my bags have an indian feel to them as i render them in a more traditional and contemporary manner
7266601 for my bags i use all sorts of woven fabrics like patola and kashid and have fused this with leather to give it a contemporary look
7266602 oversized detailed stitching sleek outer pockets print and textured fabric bags are very much in this season
7266603 most of our bags are accessorized with buckles rings buttons and studs
7266604 bright colours like red black cobalt fuchsia and orange are in but purple simply stands out
7266605 we use italian leather and sometimes nylon for our bags they enhance the durability and longevity of our products

7266695 foram realizadas duas audi ncias em fevereiro de 2008 para tentar resolver o impasse mas em nenhuma delas a prefeitura manifestou interesse pela causa
7266696 das 460 equipes previstas em 2005 hoje foram chamadas 300
7266697 we all know what brauny brought to the club over 228 games
7266698 we acknowledge now the massive impact he has had on the clubs short history
7266699 brauny was hobbling during the week and it wasnt ideal
7266700 he had a commitment to get himself up to the game and he did that it was a great effort by him and he showed it until the end with his contests on the ground today
7266701 he hasnt been able to have the rests that we would have given him because of the injuries weve had so hes had to battle on
7266702 hes always going to give 100 per cent with what he can get through
7266703 hes had a big impact on the footy club now he will over the next few weeks have a look at what he wants to do with his life
7266704 if he wants to talk to us about aspirations then were quite happy to talk to him
7266705 usually when guys play at an interstate club at some point in a 10 12 year career theres some sort of speculation of when theyll return home
7266706 the very fact that it never came up in a debate at our footy club or any footy club ive been involved with i reckon says a lot about the bloke
7266707 i thought he was a west australian thats how heavily cemented he was into the culture of the west coast eagles footy club
7266708 i think if you ask the west coast eagles footy club and all the guys that represented that club about the attributes and legacies that hes going to leave its going to be that he must have been a tremendous fella
7266709 thats the thing i like about michael braun as a competitor having never played with him or being involved with the club hes been associated with
7266710 im tired not just me but other people in massillon of getting treated like crap by the court
7266711 i was getting ready to cook my dinner in the back on the barbecue and i saw my dog went crazy he saw the smoke before i did so i saw the smoke come rolling out of the house
7266712 we were just listening to each other smile on the phone
7266713 weve all gone through triumph and tragedy in the past four years and we saw one at the beginning of this tournament here
7266714 who knows why this guy did what he did if i spend time getting angry thats not really going to help me heal or help me support my wife or my family my job is to be there for them and to help everyone get through the grieving process i think if we sit around being angry at something thats already happened thats a waste of a lot of emotion
7266715 if you want to make a case for working hard and being good then take a look at our team were not the biggest guys were not the fastest and were not going to hit the hardest but when we come on the floor we bring it i just like our heart a lot
7266716 on the one hand im mourning the loss of my father in law
7266717 my heart aches for my wife and for our family on the other hand im extremely proud for my team for our organization for what weve been able to achieve over these four years those are the two emotions i have obviously theyre conflicted

7266730 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies
7266731 today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7266732 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7266733 but you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention they they get

7266742 our goal from a partnership perspective has always been to have continuity and competitiveness
7266743 we have had a great working relationship with the dodgers in our first two seasons our players have been active in the mid michigan community and our association with the dodgers brand which has such a rich tradition of history and excellence has provided additional recognition and exposure to our franchise
7266744 obviously we would like to see and our fans would like to see a more competitive product on the field
7266745 that continues to be the focus of our conversations with our colleagues within the dodgers organization we believe after our conversations with them that they are going to do everything within reason to put a more competitive team on the field
7266746 we are thrilled to continue our partnership with the great lakes loons and with the mid michigan region

7266749 david has a combination of passion for the game deep basketball knowledge integrity and organizational skills the vancouver titans are fortunate to have david petroziello as our gm
7266750 having loved and lost before with professional basketball i can understand that there may be some who look sceptically upon a new minor league team establishing itself here i also know however that there is an incredible thirst not being met for high level basketball in the lower mainland which has grown significantly in the past five years and i am confident that the vancouver titans can fill that need
7266751 arguing with anonymous strangers on the internet is a suckers game because they almost always turn out to be or to be indistinguishable from self righteous sixteen year olds possessing infinite amounts of free time

7266757 it is clear that we are on the brink of a major change that goes well beyond the end of another cycle of civilian military rule in pakistan
7266758 the pakistani army always has updated plans for a war in kashmir for an indian invasion and for taking control of government
7266759 we just dusted off the right file and it was over in hours
7266760 no one will now be able to say that this agency is not under the elected government control
7266761 michael v hayden the cia chief who met the prime minister at a dinner on monday told mr gilani that pakistan will have to do something about the alleged involvement of isi officials with the militants some information in the cia charge sheet was so damning that the pakistanis could not deny them

7266766 centers economic reform program is caged with large benefits intended for the capitalist coterie of this government unless there is moderation in this reform program there is every danger of losing the peoples support for economic restructuring and reforms inclusive growth is the mantra
7266767 i have not ordered their closure i welcome private investment in all sectors of the economy corporate retailing will not be stopped there was a law and order problem with affected people taking to the streets after these retail outlets were opened law and order that has deteriorated over years is being restored once that is done investors of all hues are bound to make uttar pradesh their home
7266768 there is absolutely no contradiction in balancing aspirations of people from different strata of society we are trying to make the dalits understand that the divisive politics practiced by both upa and nda are not in their favor
7266769 i propose to unleash a fresh dose of economic reforms with moderation the only rider will be that corporations should adopt a policy of affirmative action as in the united states a policy of job reservation for the deprived lot will be put in place
7266770 the armed forces have no intention to stay in charge any longer than is absolutely necessary to pave the way for true democracy to flourish
7266771 concern for the state of pakistans democracy melted away and the military government was hailed by the west as an
7266772 history repeats itself in the large because human nature changes with geological leisureliness
7266773 no one has any commitment to any principle or willing to do anything for the larger good of the country
7266774 so many things have been broken in this country you wonder if they can fix them
7266775 if youd only do things my way everything would be okay
7266776 it may be possible to find explanations of spiritual experiences such as ours but i have often tried to explain my own and have succeeded only in giving the story of it i know the feeling it gave me and the results it has brought but i realize i may never fully understand its deeper why and how
7266777 i believe a power greater than myself chose me to recover yet i do not know why i try not to worry or wonder about what i do not know instead i trust that if i continue to work the steps practice the a a principles in my life and share my story i will be guided lovingly toward a deep and mature spirituality in which more will be revealed to me for the time being it is a gift for me to trust god work the steps and help others

7266810 people would hear how someone was caught and they started begging me to write a book telling the many stories of arrest so i sat down and wrote it complete with pictures and i have to say it turned out really humorous now folks tell me that when they start reading it they just cant put it down many have convinced me that my book should be a movie so i wrote the screenplay and a sequel for secrets of a modern day bounty hunter kinda ambitious i guess but what the heck
7266811 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again

7266824 brandon is going to play a lot of games for us this season
7266825 the deep ball and press coverage and thats what i worked on hard this offseason before i hurt my arm i told jay that if we improve that in our game deep ball and press coverage were going to be pretty tough
7266826 he understands coverages kind of like i do and we got a good feel when hes going to be 1 on 1 were going to take some shots if thats going to be the case
7266827 i mean if they want to press him up and start jamming him and play nobody over the top thats what youre going to get youre going to get some deep balls with us hes hard to stop
7266828 is there any way that obama could be more perfect
7266829 read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what
7266830 im not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes
7266831 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
7266832 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
7266833 has evolved rather than switched positions in his 25 year career
7266834 i understand your county commission has set a worlds record for holding the longest legislative session in history without actually accomplishing anything i mean how does one actually do that talk for 12 hours or more and accomplish nothing is it you know a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing or is there more to the story perhaps they intended to set this record which is a questionable achievement but an achievement nonetheless so i think there are many stories like that to go in search of
7266835 if its got balance and by balance we mean walking upright straight ahead with no going whoooaaa and wooo and staggering way off the course on witch hunts and dog and pony shows and if it doesnt call the hospitality fund a slush fund then we welcome it
7266836 absolutely this will keep scrutiny on the things that need scrutinying and did you know theyve already asked me to appear on some episodes
7266837 if they need some homespun wisdom from a straight talking no nonsense old warhorse i know where they can find im
7266838 it was so silly so cheesy it just churned big urns of cheese it jumped the shark before there was even a shark to jump i mean they even did an episode where mr nimoy straight facedly asked if sherlock holmes was real they might just as well have asked if mr spock was real
7266839 hes pulling down ridiculously large checks for the idiotic price thingy commercials and winning emmys
7266840 i decided it was time i started causing a little stir too
7266841 how did my government get so screwed up that question resonates far beyond the boundaries of knox county across the universe probably its knox county under the microscope but what we see there applies macroscopically its the old micro to macro ploy
7266842 what makes one of your commissioners think petulantly whining about the length of meetings is a
7266843 try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism
7266844 the single dumbest thing ive ever heard of him doing
7266845 it just shows you hes not ready for the big time
7266846 why do we wear pins because our country is under attack
7266847 why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders for they do not wash their hands before they eat
7266848 have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon
7266849 and his disciples came and urged him saying send her away for she keeps shouting after us
7266850 i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
7266851 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
7266852 then jesus answered her woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish and her daughter was healed instantly
7266853 why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders
7266854 i filed this action at this time to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7266855 beijing 6 were ultimately sentenced through an extrajudicial proceeding they did not get to go to court to 10 days of detainment as some of us guessed it turned out to be shorter with the end of the olympics
7266856 beijing 6 and a couple others have received special treatment with respect to the precedent set in handling previous alleged disruptions during the olympics

7266860 yeah im good at this i love my new bike
7266861 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7266862 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7266863 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games
7266864 so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7266865 it was more teamwork probably well directed by their coaching staff
7266866 ive seen the guys hungry and want to get back to the top
7266867 thats what theyve done they were able to get to the top again and show that they should be in first place but they had to work for it
7266868 if it wasnt for the determination and the willpower that we have in each other we wouldnt have pulled through and gotten this win
7266869 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7266870 what you saw today was a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals well what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7266871 we felt that athleticism and great defense would offset a lot of things
7266872 the versatility this squad would have and the character of the guys a lot of that negates size
7266873 weve got a lot of guys on this team that are individually great
7266874 security has been tightened in and around tatas small car project more than 4 000 policemen have been deployed
7266875 our party will fight to the finish to get the land back
7266876 the government acquired 997 acres of land for the project the project needs about 600 acres
7266877 it is totally impractical to give back the land as demanded returning the 400 acres means scrapping the entire project
7266878 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7266879 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7266880 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7266881 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7266882 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad

7266884 the army and people of north korea will never remain an onlooker to the u s military and the south korean bellicose forces staging frantic anti north korea war moves
7266885 should the u s imperialists and their following forces misjudge north koreas will and act rashly
7266886 will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors to the last man
7266887 what is this party uncloaking upwards of me this time signal

7266894 joes wife neilia and their little girl naomi were killed in a car accident and their two boys were badly hurt
7266895 when joe was sworn in as a senator there was no ceremony in the capitol instead he was standing by his sons in the hospital room where they were recovering he was 30 years old
7266896 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith heres how joe biden responded he never moved to washington instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train
7266897 there is a school very close to the zoo and they must hear them all the time i wondered if one of the pupils sitting exams might be bright enough to write on his paper that he couldnt concentrate because of the noise
7266898 these are pretty rare animals and there arent that many people in the country who have the chance to hear a pair of duetting gibbons
7266899 if youre shutting them in an enclosed space unless it has proper acoustic dampening youre going to damage their eardrums so unless theyre going to redesign their house it is disastrous
7266900 i think its going to go down more unfortunately some people are not going to be able to hang on
7266901 the big election issue is definitely going to be the economy
7266902 around here there was at least the perception of stability not that we thought that anyone here was immune but we were just very surprised to see that some of our closest neighbours were affected by this national foreclosure crisis
7266903 in this immediate cluster its been four homes just within this little court which is about 20 22 houses
7266904 the only thing that sort of saves the neighbourhood are the covenants so they keep the lawns mowed even in homes that are foreclosed
7266905 we will surely try to bring the boats back again
7266906 the goal is to open a route between cyprus and gaza people here are just ecstatic to see that someone cares
7266907 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7266908 israels siege of the gaza strip is one of the great crimes of the 21st century which the governments of the west and the arab league are abetting by their silence
7266909 we are more interested in running our own race and if others like our race then that is an endorsement of our creative and marketing plans and ideas
7266910 on so many of those records the sound of that weeping guitar is what you hear long before you hear hanks voice
7266911 i think all the sidemen that hank used back in those days were the finest musicians in the world and don was the standout player you heard him more than anyone except the fiddle
7266912 medicine is scarce and there is only one doctor and a few nurses that shows how we are unable to cope
7266913 i heard some people calling for help but i couldnt do anything
7266914 we dont want psychologists we want a technical expert to tell us what happened to our loved ones
7266915 our special appreciation and our deeply felt gratitude are also extended to the men and women athletes from all parts of the world whose magnificent performances we have witnessed with admiration and whose names will live on in the history of sport i hope that the games have assisted in strengthening the olympic ideals and thereby have helped to form a connecting link between the nations
7266916 thank you uncle sam for the uniforms you presented to the russian paratroopers
7266917 first chinalco has undertaken to me that it would not raise its shareholding above this level without notifying and receiving fresh approval from the government under australias foreign investment review arrangements
7266918 second chinalco has also undertaken that it will not seek to appoint a director to rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited for as long as it holds a shareholding of below 15
7266919 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7266920 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter

7266943 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7266944 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7266945 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7266946 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7266947 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7266948 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7266949 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7266950 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7266951 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7266952 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters

7266971 there are three sides of an arguement your side my side and the right side
7266972 the fed listens to wall street and believes what it hears
7266973 this distortion into a partial and often highly distorted perception of reality is unhealthy and dangerous
7266974 as if by osmosis the objectives interests and perception of reality of the vested interest they are meant to regulate and supervise in the public interest
7266975 few regulators had succeeded in escaping in a lasting manner their capture by the regulated industry
7266976 would involve an attempt by regulators to develop a more fully integrated overview of the entire financial system
7266977 the recent decline in commodity prices as well as the increased stability of the dollar has been encouraging
7266978 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
7266979 congress may wish to consider whether such a framework should be set up for a defined set of non bank institutions
7266980 after very healthy gains on wall street on friday at face value it looks like it will be a very good day for our market
7266981 but oil fell significantly and gold and base metals were down the waxing and waning weve seen between the financials and resources is going to continue
7266982 more weakness in late september october is anticipated as the global economic downturn feeds into more downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue

7266986 if you dont buy well its such an uphill slog thereafter
7266987 if we havent done it in the first 90 days then in my view youre not going to get it done so we absolutely integrate quickly or ruthlessly
7266988 that was the signal to the company that we were changing things
7266989 those who reject the rules of the game and fundamentally critique the system like ron paul or dennis kucinich are simply quarantined ridiculed by the bought media and often face primary challenges organized by the party hierarchy
7266990 the american people are not noted for their driving intellectual curiosity in the first place but should public indignation lead to protest it is quickly channeled into electoral politics where the protest is drained of life elections themselves are characterized by personality contests horse race trivia and strenuous efforts to avoid real issues the opposing candidates chosen by political hierarchies afford the voter the choice between coke and diet coke even if he desperately wants bordeaux

7266998 i dont think we would have had the success we initially had without nigel but i think that it feels like its going to be a different show this year and well have to see if thats a negative or an advantage
7266999 and the other problem was that they were so media savvy these contestants that they never really showed us their true personalities they were like robots

7267020 whether it is big or small will depend on how hard qantas comes back to respond to air nzs pricing moves
7267021 virgin blues decision is likely to be seen as a better financial option than purely parking the planes while the additional capacity on the sydney auckland route will place downward pressure on yields for both air nz and qantas
7267022 its hard to see how that one will unfold but at present i think the situation with the company is still unravelling
7267023 however i dont believe that there is a culture which is sufficiently robust to prevent it rehappening so therefore there has got to be some remedial action
7267024 that potentially jeopardises the economic and social sustainability of the sector

7267039 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu
7267040 they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7267041 to seek further information about the incident and to confirm the welfare of mr brennan
7267042 we are awaiting advice from the somali government we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia to seek their co operation and assistance

7267045 i know ibrahim is not there he had a very strong character

7267052 being a high achiever in your subject area does not mean youre going to be a good teacher

7267065 dont allow anyone to say we are opposed to population growth or that we are going to point fingers at migration if we put out the stop sign then we are sending the wrong messages and this economy will suffer long term
7267066 the problem on our trains the problem with our lack of water resources is caused by a failure to plan not by population growth
7267067 population growth is not to be feared what is to be feared is the people who dont plan for it
7267068 recognises a deteriorating quality of life inherent in the ongoing increase in the population of greater melbourne
7267069 we need to take a bolder policy agenda to meet peoples material concerns and thats why this policy resonates across the social spectrum
7267070 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that
7267071 politically we also have to contrast that with the tories
7267072 cameron has fashioned a new conservative language but his attachment to the market means he cant actually make britain a fairer society he can only talk about it
7267073 this poll vindicates what wed thought all along the compass windfall tax policy is both radical and popular just the sort of measure the government needs if it is to win back voters
7267074 as millions of britons struggle to make ends meet the energy and oil companies struggle with a different challenge what to do with all their windfall profits
7267075 we get record price rises and they get record profits this has got to stop and government must intervene
7267076 its right that some of those undeserved profits are used to help people pay their bills this winter and to help insulate homes for future winters thats why our policy for a sensible one off windfall tax is right

7267083 were not going to solve all the problems between the two sides but were definitely on the right road and when the peace accords are signed the people on the ground through our projects are going to be ready
7267084 these events do not specifically address israeli occupation of the palestinian people and that is where i think the harm lies because it gives the impression that the conflict is simply a dispute between bad neighbours
7267085 it is more of a feel good impression about the situation whereas the suffering of palestinian people is totally sidelined
7267086 we need to hear from mr rudd how he will address the current slowdown without rudd speak and without a commitment to simply watch
7267087 what that shows is dr nelson and mr turnbull are willing to play politics with the budget surplus that australia needs as a buffer in uncertain global conditions
7267088 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7267089 unless students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
7267090 in this case they werent marked on their information about the olympic games but on whether they used persuasive language effectively to make their argument

7267127 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7267134 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7267138 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7267139 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7267140 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7267141 the extent of the use of military force by the russian side appears seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from georgia and the picture conveyed by the media not inappropriately high
7267142 were not in a position given their weapons and equipment to defend themselves effectively or even to resist
7267143 the deployment of air power despite the regrettable civilian casualties can be seen as militarily appropriate to the operation
7267144 pull out your nicest dishes and light a couple of candles even if youre just having a mushroom pizza
7267145 its the mood not the food that sets a romantic scene so stick a bouquet of daisies from the corner store in the center of the table lower the lights and turn up enrique iglesias or bessie smith you could even conveniently forget the utensils so you have an excuse to feed each other
7267146 the way you stand hip to hip block out the world and sway to each others rhythms now youre really cookin
7267147 a fitted t shirt or a semi sheer tank top especially when worn without a bra is a lot sexier than some too big shirt youre swimming in
7267148 pair it with your favorite perfectly worn out blue jeans or khaki cutoffs for a casual but irresistible look
7267149 okay its totally old fashioned and cornball but i find doing dishes together incredibly romantic
7267150 my dishwasher went on the blink one night and my boyfriend offered to help clean up we both rolled up our sleeves and got sudsy in the warm water we talked about the places wed love to travel to the crazy things wed like to try just once in our lives and our hands kept touching we just got completely lost in each other as we did this mindless activity it was so sweet and oddly intimate that i havent bothered to get the dishwasher fixed
7267151 give each other mini foot massages while watching the evening news
7267152 or lay your head in his lap and let him stroke your hair
7267153 then have your guy blindly choose one of the cards and embark on a mysterious exotic adventure
7267154 unplug the phone computer and tv then turn off all the lights
7267155 with nothing else to distract you you have no choice but to break out the candles and cling to each other as you tell scary ghost stories or just plain cling to each other
7267156 well get in bed or curl up on the couch and take turns being the narrator at first i was a bit nervous and rigid i sounded like rod serling from the twilight zone but eventually i found my natural rhythm and got really turned on by it its so utterly romantic because were in this sort of fantastical fictional world together rather than sticking our noses in our respective books and listening to my boyfriends voice is unbelievably sexy
7267157 its a way to steal a very intimate moment when youre both usually so rushed to get out the door
7267158 i have a standing friday evening drink date with my boyfriend
7267159 to keep it exciting i have this trick for spicing things up i send him on a treasure hunt to find me i pick an obscure out of the way bar one wed never normally go to in a million years then every hour on the hour during the workday i send my boyfriend an e mail feeding him clues about where i want him to meet me that night little riddles that hint at the name landmarks that will lead him to the location when he puts all the pieces together he finds me waiting in the most private booth i can find now hes scheming up the next mystery meeting
7267160 we talk about upcoming vacations friends movies anything that lets us share ideas instead of bombarding each other with tales of work woes after eight hours of focusing on other people on the job its such a luxurious treat to indulge in some time thats all about us
7267161 get your mind out of the grind and back onto me
7267162 the next time your guy sleeps over spritz a small item of clothing scarf underwear camisole with your signature fragrance and slyly slip it into his briefcase or backpack
7267163 with your sexy scent wafting out every time he reaches into his bag he wont be able to take his mind off of you
7267164 este insumo podr ser adquirido en las zonas de despacho correspondientes a los puertos de bah a blanca san nicol s y necochea al tiempo que la empresa ampliar su distribuci n directa en las zonas de trenque lauquen y en las provincias de chaco y entre r os

7267166 at this time the athletes and coaches of the university were facing teams that were bigger and better equipped yet they had splendid fighting spirit the term trojan as applied to usc means to me that no matter what the situation what the odds or what the conditions the competition must be carried on to the end and those who strive must give all they have and never be weary in doing so
7267167 marin had one child could get in his canoe and paddle over to a deserted island in maine then hike 10 miles to this special place where he would paint for 10 hours
7267168 joann you have a landscape in your home draw and paint your childrens toys for example
7267169 at this time the athletes and coaches of the university were facing teams that were bigger and better equipped yet they had splendid fighting spirit the term trojan as applied to usc means to me that no matter what the situation what the odds or what the conditions the competition must be carried on to the end and those who strive must give all they have and never be weary in doing so
7267170 the iconic talent gathering together from the international film and music communities for this project is amazing
7267171 although plans were made during mr gambaris visit for him to meet with aung san suu kyi on august 20 daw aung san suu kyi refused to meet him
7267172 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7267173 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7267174 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7267175 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7267176 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7267177 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7267178 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7267179 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7267180 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7267181 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad
7267182 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7267183 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7267184 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7267185 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7267186 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7267187 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7267188 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7267189 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7267190 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7267191 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7267192 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7267193 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7267194 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7267195 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7267196 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7267197 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7267198 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7267199 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7267200 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7267201 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters
7267202 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7267203 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7267215 estudiaremos cada reclamaci n y les intentaremos reubicar en otro lado si es que como parece no se ve
7267216 hemos llegado a la grada y cu l no ha sido nuestro estupor cuando hemos comprobado que nos hab an vendido entradas de localidades que no exist an
7267217 lo primero que nos dijeron fue que hab a mucha picaresca y que podr a tratarse de entradas falsificadas por los reventas es indignante
7267218 se han intentado lavar las manos hasta que nos hemos amotinado en esta oficina entre nosotros hay un abogado que habla de estafa por el importe de las entradas y dice que demandar a los organizadores
7267219 los detenidos pol ticos no tuvimos la oportunidad de garantizar el respeto de nuestros derechos en los procedimientos y sin embargo stos sirvieron para justificar ante la opini n p blica los traslados de los presos lvaro gene l pez trasladado a la penitenciar a de combita tulio murillo marulanda y felix sanabria trasladados a la c rcel de valledupar lu s arturo garc s e inocencio morales trasladados al centro de reclusi n palogordo ubicado en gir n santander
7267220 estamos convencidos que estas medidas injustificadas responden a las pretensiones de sometimiento del inpec y de las autoridades del establecimiento las cuales se inventan falsos planes de fuga para afectar nuestros derechos fundamentales
7267221 nos sorprende que se pretenda justificar las agresiones contra los presos pol ticos y prisioneros de guerra que nos encontr bamos recluidos en la torre tres de este establecimiento carcelario cuando en diversas oportunidades se nos reconoci por parte del cuerpo de custodia y vigilancia nuestro comportamiento y nivel de convivencia ejemplar en el mismo
7267222 llamamos a las personas y organizaciones solidarias y defensoras de los derechos humanos nacionales e internacionales a exigir de las autoridades colombianas el respeto de nuestros derechos y que cesen inmediatamente las agresiones contra nosotros
7267223 hubo una negligencia en el accidente sabemos que muchos quisieron bajar
7267224 nein die sind zwar finster aber haben die macht nur in bayern und sto en au erhalb auf sehr wenig akzeptanz das halte ich f r eine falsche strategie
7267225 au erdem zu viel bier und zu wenig caipi was h ltst du von george w bush

7267227 bei g nter jauch nicht ber die 100 euro frage zu kommen ist richtig b se
7267228 daran denke ich st ndig wenn ich in der irrenanstalt bin

7267230 mit luzifer den m sste ich dann lu ii nennen damit es nicht zu verwechslungen zwischen euch beiden kommt aber wie erreiche ich das h rnchen muss ich satanische riten auf friedh fen vollf hren
7267231 normalerweise ja aber es gibt da noch eine weitere m glichkeit

7267236 ganz klar da steht dass der auftrag gesperrt ist den m ssen sie freigeben lassen dann klappts auch mit der bestellanforderung
7267237 warum ist denn der auftrag gesperrt und wer kann den freigeben
7267238 der auftrag ist gesperrt weil ich es als allm chtige weltherrscherin so m chte
7267239 sprechen sie dazu bitte ihren zust ndigen controller an der kann ihnen helfen
7267240 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7267241 this year a lot of people are trying to save money
7267242 he likes the sling style not too big not too small
7267243 i dont think im a typical back to school shopper i dont feel when theyre going back to school its necessary to go shopping except for the backpack because his was literally falling apart
7267244 hell wear the same clothing to school that he wears in the summer
7267245 normally i would go to the mall but im staying closer to home
7267246 but if i have money in my pocket i spend it
7267247 right now a lot of people are on the line
7267248 to send something by air its about a 34 percent surcharge on ground its about 10 percent
7267249 i wish i had known that stores like bed bath amp beyond let you order from home and pick up your things
7267250 dont bring too many sweatshirts because youre going to buy and get school apparel
7267251 without knowing the specifics i cant say why that happened but we havent changed our policy on musical instruments we do let customers carry on instruments if they fit within the overhead bin requirements if they dont they are required to either check it or if they wish purchase a seat
7267252 ship your stuff the cheapest way a week or two before then itll be there when you get there
7267253 und so legte der tod seine sense beiseite und stieg auf den rasenm her denn es war krieg
7267254 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7267255 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7267256 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7267257 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7267258 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7267259 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7267260 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7267261 who are open to doing something on the production side
7267262 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7267263 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7267264 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7267265 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7267266 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7267267 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7267268 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7267269 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7267270 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7267271 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7267272 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7267273 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7267274 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7267275 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7267276 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7267277 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7267278 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7267279 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7267280 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7267281 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7267282 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7267283 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7267284 now that i have this list which i didnt have in my hands a little while ago im going to take some action on it
7267285 now i will go back and have an engineer look at the buildings and ask is there a concern with it
7267286 i would put my own children in these schools tomorrow
7267287 to find seismic problems you have to be looking for seismic problems
7267288 making sure that stairways and restrooms are accessible for disabled students doesnt mean youre going to identify a seismic weakness
7267289 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
7267290 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
7267291 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
7267292 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
7267293 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
7267294 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
7267295 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
7267296 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
7267297 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
7267298 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth
7267299 he was hit because he was lazy and refused to memorize his verses
7267300 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7267301 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7267302 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7267303 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7267304 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7267305 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7267306 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7267307 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7267308 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7267309 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7267310 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7267311 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7267312 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7267313 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7267314 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7267315 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7267316 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7267317 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7267318 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7267319 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7267320 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7267321 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7267322 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7267323 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7267324 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7267325 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7267326 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7267327 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7267328 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7267329 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7267330 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7267331 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7267332 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7267333 i got back in the lab last week and a lot of chron and beer later were almost done with the
7267334 the studio is set to announce its plans for future dc movies in the next month for now though it is focused on releasing four comic book films in the next three years including a third batman film a new film reintroducing superman and two movies focusing on other dc comics characters

7267353 she will be released tomorrow our consul spoke to the mfa

7267366 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7267367 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7267368 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7267369 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7267370 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7267371 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7267372 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7267373 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7267374 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first

7267398 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7267399 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7267400 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7267401 if i got it i got it but its supposed to be fair play theyre supposed to go by the rules
7267402 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7267403 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7267404 winning bronze is not the same as going home empty handed
7267405 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7267406 the obama desire to get out and the mccain desire to succeed could be coming together in the form of an ability to get out while succeeding
7267407 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives
7267408 facts have to affect your decision making and over the course of 16 months things are going to constantly change
7267409 he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight

7267419 the leagues hockey operations committee will now take the time it needs to analyze the recommendations

7267421 the biblical adage that we reap what we sow is very true in criminal justice
7267422 has historically had one of the worst run prison systems in the nation treating inmates like caged animals only to see them released back into their communities angrier and more bitter than they originally were

7267427 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7267428 we dont have any concrete informations on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7267429 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7267430 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7267431 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7267432 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7267433 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7267434 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7267435 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7267436 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7267437 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7267438 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7267439 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7267440 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with over the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts it has put a lot of pressure on me
7267441 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7267442 but coming to your first olympics getting fourth that was awesome
7267443 it was obviously a very close game which didnt come as any surprise
7267444 both teams played nervous at times and also had their opportunities there were a couple of good scoring chances for both sides both teams were evenly matched and everyone put 100 per cent into it
7267445 its a sad way to lose a game i would rather see a replay on another day but thats hard to do because of the time factor its not a nice way to lose
7267446 after overtime and a few little injuries its nice to get some rest on sunday a day off will certainly be helpful
7267447 it was extremely hot all game there was a little bit of a breeze but the sun was shining and it was certainly a very hot day for it and playing on the turf it seems to radiate heat it makes it about five degrees warmer than what the temperatures actually showing
7267448 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7267449 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7267450 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7267451 it can definitely go down to the last race its quite possible
7267452 we in b c have fires that get out of control two weeks a year down there its seven months a year
7267453 victory actually makes the pain go away so i felt no pain
7267454 it was the most difficult gold medal for us were really happy
7267455 this was more satisfying than the other two gold medals millions of hungarians saw this this is an amazing achievement
7267456 even in difficulty we believed we could come out of it we defended better that was the key but we were very worried

7267460 this incident underlines why we believe it is irresponsible to leave scab managers in charge of any tube station not least a busy one with lifts
7267461 we understand that managers left floundering by the emergency delayed calling the fire brigade and that the fire service eventually responded to a call from one of the trapped passengers
7267462 under normal circumstances if it took more than 20 minutes to get people out managers would be demanding to know why it had taken so long and if it took more than an hour they would be looking for someone to discipline
7267463 safety reps tell me that the failsafe systems on the lifts at elephant and castle are unusual but the people normally staffing the station are familiar with them
7267464 instead of parachuting in scab managers without the training local experience and knowledge to cope when things go wrong lul should be sorting out the injustice to jerome bowes that has led to this dispute in the first place
7267465 rmt has now agreed to ballot bakerloo line drivers at elephant and castle and if lul does not want this dispute to escalate that is what they should now do
7267466 quieren que todos seamos jefas y jefes de familia para tenernos marcados para hacernos votar lo que ellos quieren y perpetuarse en el poder tenemos que volver a reconstruir el trabajo porque es la nica garant a de dignidad y la forma de superar estos planes sociales que nos condenan a la miseria
7267467 la historia del clientelismo es la historia de los hijos de puta siempre dije que el que mancilla la dignidad humana porque tiene una ayuda del gobierno es un hijo de puta

7267476 man im fine its one of those freak things that happen
7267477 i was trying to make a block on kickoff return and the guy spun away from me and rotated this way and fell it was a freak accident
7267478 i just told them to snap it into place it didnt hurt it was one of those things where you know you broke it but i was fine
7267479 i just couldnt hang onto the ball grip it to throw like i would have needed to if it doesnt get any worse i should be ok or at least i feel that way right now
7267480 its about what you can do now and its not always the best player that plays its whos playing the best
7267481 were both talented and theyre going to go with whoevers quickest and strongest thats what weve got to realize
7267482 weve got new stuff we have to pick up real quick but once you get into the swing of things and start to learn the defense then youre just out there reacting and being an athlete and everything slows down
7267483 when you make plays like that you dont really even know whats going on you kind of black out a little bit
7267484 the only thing going through my head was catch the ball
7267485 he had loose bodies in there they cleaned it out
7267486 they felt very positive with the clean out well just have to wait and see how long it takes
7267487 i think i did good but theres always room to get better
7267488 i missed a couple tackles im tough on myself as a defense thats one area we could improve on is tackling we left a couple tackles out there that should have been made
7267489 well i remember one game when he caught a quick screen at the 45 yard line i started out even with him and by time he crossed the goal line he was 10 yards ahead of me
7267490 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7267491 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7267492 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7267493 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7267494 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad
7267495 security has been tightened in and around tatas small car project more than 4 000 policemen have been deployed
7267496 our party will fight to the finish to get the land back
7267497 the government acquired 997 acres of land for the project the project needs about 600 acres
7267498 it is totally impractical to give back the land as demanded returning the 400 acres means scrapping the entire project
7267499 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7267500 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7267501 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7267502 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7267503 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7267504 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7267505 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7267506 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7267507 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7267508 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters

7267526 i cant say at all that we have confidence in israel
7267527 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7267528 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7267529 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7267530 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing
7267531 i was as a cook when i deployed the first time with the 1123d back in april of 2003
7267532 i didnt want to go but i got to know a lot of people and it wasnt bad
7267533 i checked my army knowledge online mail and saw i had a request for offer to be in kansas by feb 1 2008 to take command of the battalion
7267534 i ended up clearing during the holidays and arrived in kansas the last week of january 2007
7267535 we went on a double date and afterward didnt see or attempt to contact each other for a few months in fact ok was mad because she had been set up with a bald man yes i was already bald this is not just a haircut and she really didnt care for me after that first date
7267536 i walked with her from work to catch the city bus that day and weve been together ever since on feb 22 2008 they celebrated 16 years of marriage
7267537 not only are they new missions technically but there are also organizational and cultural differences among the adjutant general branch finance branch and logisticians so understanding adapting to and assimilating these new missions soldiers and units were the biggest challenge
7267538 i like to be able to be a cheerleader for my subordinate units and soldiers
7267539 moreover since asc is a construction and trading company an increasing number of local nationals are being employed to fulfill the demanding transportation and material handling requirements
7267540 they are integrating the locals in the workforce and by the increase in human rights as well as giving freedom and justice to the people
7267541 all vendors that the golden company uses are in baghdad and nearby suburbs
7267542 since the united states military has taken control of baghdad the salaries of the iraqi workers have increased from 10 to 50 per day while working less hours within the sana beirut company
7267543 estoy preocupado porque el equipo no puede concretar falta poder ofensivo
7267544 rescato la actitud y las oportunidades de gol pero no pudimos convertir y eso hay que trabajarlo
7267545 ich h re auf damit eine neue ra in der fivb beginnen kann
7267546 ich wei nicht ob er ein rossoneri wird ich wei ja nicht einmal ob arsenal ihn berhaupt verkaufen will
7267547 er w re ja nicht der erste spieler der mit uns in verbindung gebracht wird und dann doch nicht kommt
7267548 er ist gl cklich dass er in zukunft weiter ein teil des vereins sein kann
7267549 man muss ihm vorwerfen dass er sich nicht mehr auf seine st rken besinnt wie zum beispiel seine extrem starke vorhand und den knallharten aufschlag
7267550 ich f hle mich st rker als es der vierte platz ausdr ckt
7267551 ich spiele besser denn je vor allem was den aufschlag betrifft zu wissen dass ich roger schlagen kann gibt mir unendlich viel selbstvertrauen
7267552 im sport ist es wie im leben der einzige weg dort erfolg zu haben wo du zuvor gescheitert bist ist die vergangenheit hinter dir zu lassen und den blick unvoreingenommen auf kommende aufgaben zu richten
7267553 ebert darf das nicht machen er hat sich entschuldigt bei mir
7267554 f r mich und den rest des teams ist es verwunderlich dass er nicht gespielt hat
7267555 nat rlich war es ein technischer fehler von kaka aber ich bedauere meine entscheidung nicht kaka hat in der vorbereitung gut gespielt und jo hat noch etwas r ckstand
7267556 essen schlafen und schwimmen das ist alles was ich kann

7267558 der frosch ist ins milchglas gefallen jetzt kann er sich entscheiden ob er ertrinken will oder so lange strampelt bis aus der milch butter geworden ist und er raussteigen kann wir werden strampeln

7267578 i can tell you that in bend there are a lot of people wanting to leave but cant until their homes sell
7267579 the cost of living in central oregon versus the pay in this area makes it very tough for people

7267652 he was funny if you sat here talking with him youd be laughing but you could never believe anything he told you
7267653 i think in four years he changed the name of his company six times
7267654 he told me not to cash it for a week
7267655 i waited a couple of days then went to the bank they told me there was no money in the account
7267656 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers will leave the theater thinking retard is an ok word to use

7267665 we need a rate that allows people to legally park at the curb when they need to drop something off see the dentist go to a meeting for an hour
7267666 we believe that this is the kind of location where you should get in and out in two hours these are short term spaces
7267667 weve been brought up from conception to think cheap parking is a good idea
7267668 its part of our primitive reptilian cortex we just arent logical about parking
7267669 is there a pricing point by which transit becomes more attractive then driving between higher meters and the price of gas youre there you now have incentivized people to get out of their cars and onto transit
7267670 i think theres going to be a lot of people initially very upset by it
7267671 it sounds good in theory but in reality i think it would deter people from visiting the city
7267672 they dont want to spend a lot of money at meters meters are supposed to be cheap
7267673 we see them coming out to feed the meter all day thats not what parking meters are for theyre for you to come and park for one hour or two hours while youre shopping
7267674 if the city can free up those meters by charging more we are very much in favor of it
7267675 up until now the balance has really been autocentric and part of what were looking at is how to better accommodate transit and walking and cycling
7267676 we dont think its reasonable to expect people to carry around a roll of quarters
7267677 all i need you to do is step into this room right here strip to the waist then slip on this gown
7267678 hmmmm can you stand on your tippy toes and lean in a tad so we can get everything

7267682 the fact that you have to look at your cell phone even for that one second is dangerous
7267683 you see people texting and walking all the time thats all people are doing
7267684 clearly if youre engaged in texting that requires concentration its very difficult to do another task especially walking in a big city
7267685 with time were knocking out our visual and audio cues that are grounding us in our environment
7267686 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact

7267688 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history

7267737 by speaking out on behalf of the palestinians and lebanese people we can give voice to those that some governments and media would wish to silence
7267738 looking back i think i just bought the prevailing polemic on campus at the time that israel was some sort of quasi theocracy having explored the subject more deeply since then i understand this is nonsense
7267739 i realise i just misunderstood obviously the state of israel is not a state for the jewish religion but a homeland for the jewish people
7267740 its a really robust democracy there are plenty of non jewish people in israel who have full citizenship rights
7267741 if there is discrimination its no worse than what would happen in australia or america or anywhere else i completely support israels right to exist as a jewish state

7267748 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this county and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes
7267749 it was not done with any malicious intent but unfortunately some people have attempted to make it a political issue

7267799 i ask the prime minister again to please reconsider his decision cutting these programs robs our artists of the opportunity to take to the world stage and robs the world of canadian culture
7267800 the cuts to our culture clearly show the conservative governments complete disrespect toward our countrys cultural institutions and a flagrant lack of vision that is hurting our arts community and culture
7267801 as i have written the prime minister to explain the 4 7 million program costs each canadian 14 cents
7267802 this money provides small grants of 750 and 1 500 to individuals so they can go overseas to promote their art artists are not wealthy corporations artists need this help and canada needs artists

7267819 welcome to our space positive energy projection is the trip care in the preparation of food requires time especially if were busy so please take a deep breath relax and dig on the love amp artistry about you may all our offerings please you peace within you
7267820 du jour is an accepted form on menus and appears more often than of the day anything pie potatoes sherbet cake pudding can be du jour or de jour du jor dujour and du jour and the florentine room even has potato del giorno
7267821 you have disarmed us that means our safety now lies in your hands as far as i know the board has done nothing or very little to address this issue since the virginia tech massacre
7267822 if you seek to change the policy of this board i would strongly suggest you find some rhetoric that is based on sound logic rather than inflammatory statements id be hard pressed to ever support conceal and carry
7267823 i admire your enthusiasm i do support conceal and carry but i think regent ludwig hit on a key theme i know there are valuable resources out there that can provide statistical data and information instead of coming in front of the board with inflammatory rhetoric
7267824 one reasons burglars avoid houses when people are home is that they fear being shot during the crime
7267825 scared off shot at wounded or captured by an armed victim
7267826 a national concealed handgun permit would reduce rates of violent crime
7267827 almost 80 percent of the budget is used for infrastructure
7267828 when people go to commission meetings they get the impression that decisions are made before there is even public input
7267829 i can bring some expertise to the county county commission
7267830 people kept telling me i could have a bigger impact locally so i started researching candidates with the intent of getting behind a candidate but ultimately i didnt feel there was a candidate who i could get behind
7267831 basically the county county commission stayed at the table too long and got fat off that
7267832 within weeks of being elected they did just the opposite of what they said they were going to do
7267833 then we saw some real low clouds that were real iffy looking
7267834 i saw a point in the clouds come down and then get sucked back up
7267835 it seemed like the size of a pencil at first but then it just grew
7267836 it wasnt that far away and was in still in deep water but then it cut left and the wind started whipping up and it came on shore
7267837 when it got to the shallow water it started blowing water from the center a good 200 feet it looked like it gained 10 to 15 times in size from when it started
7267838 a power pole got ripped out and half a roof ripped off
7267839 it jumped the canal and ripped a quarter of another roof off
7267840 it looked kind of innocent but its amazing how powerful they are on the inside
7267841 ive been cleaning up tree limbs and repairing water lines
7267842 plusieurs r gions ont re u des pluies continues durant pr s dun mois un demi
7267843 pr s de 750 000 personnes sont touch es par les inondations
7267844 a lot of people are barely staying in their homes
7267845 if bob had done the right things i wouldnt be running again
7267846 we need to get construction industry back on its feet
7267847 my four years i was at the forefront in water management a founding member of the water alliance all those things came under my leadership when you look at my credentials compared to anyone they stack up very well against anyone running for the county commission
7267848 more people are looking at polk county as a result of demand
7267849 we will always have peaks and valleys in the economy you have to focus on the bigger terms
7267850 when people go to commission meetings they get the impression that decisions are made before there is even public input
7267851 all those programs are good programs but we may end up becoming something that we didnt necessarily want to be because were taking someone elses position
7267852 i dont think theyre bad things but im not really convinced that is a proper expenditure of government funds
7267853 i am not against growth but i fear for the constant building along area roads that used to be rural in nature
7267854 i fear for the disappearing pastures and rural areas of our county i want to hold developers accountable not stop growth but be in better control better than the past
7267855 the county needs to stop spending on the little stuff for little dollars
7267856 at the federal level those monies had to be used up by the end of the year and there was always money left over
7267857 if that takes place at the federal level i am sure it does on the county level
7267858 its a tough decision but it has to be made
7267859 our budget has really ballooned and there has been some irresponsibility with that
7267860 where was the discussion i mean 10 million where was the planning and discussion that would bring it before the public
7267861 i felt the spur of the moment was lack of leadership
7267862 people are hurting and everywhere you turn somebody is hurting more than you
7267863 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities its linked to the new poverty
7267864 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7267865 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7267866 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than hours its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7267867 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7267868 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past
7267869 unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes
7267870 its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan
7267871 i dont have many but i would like to shoot a tv programme soon
7267872 the french english relationship amuses me as neighbours we criticise each other we mock each other but behind all this we appreciate each other and we respect each other
7267873 id like to watch french women and observe them behind their ovens in their kitchens
7267874 im sure that the rest of the world would love a series on french cuisine directed by an english chef it would be crazy
7267875 im a dude playin a dude disguised as another dude
7267876 the mayor may not let me fire you but i wont take the heat for your fiasco
7267877 in gotham the corruption starts at the streets and reaches up in bludhaven it starts in the mayors office and reaches down
7267878 yes thats the trouble with mothers first you get to like them and then they die
7267879 most likely you go your way and ill go mine
7267880 americans like to be scared thats why they elected george bush

7267887 the decay of decency in the modern age the rebellion against law and good faith the treatment of human beings as things as the mere instruments of power and ambition is without a doubt the consequence of the decay of the belief in man as something more than an animal animated by highly conditioned reflexes and chemical reactions for unless man is something more than that he has no rights that anyone is bound to respect and there are no limitations upon his conduct which he is bound to obey

7267912 una herida cortopunzante en el t rax que le provoc la muerte en el consultorio del lugar
7267913 diese gefahr besteht immer wenn du aus der mitte der startaufstellung startest
7267914 dieses mal war es nakajima der in uns krachte das war es dann
7267915 das ist sehr ungl cklich auch wenn es diesmal kein mechanisches problem war lasst uns hoffen dass wir in spa etwas mehr gl ck haben
7267916 wir warteten bis das auto berpr ft war sie bewerteten den schaden aber abgesehen vom heckfl gel gab es auch besch digungen an der aufh ngung und im getriebe es h tte ber eine stunde gedauert die teile zu wechseln
7267917 das haben wir gebraucht ich h tte vielleicht etwas h rter mit denny hamlin und kevin harvick k mpfen k nnen aber das war es nicht wert
7267918 war zwar nicht das beste auto auf der strecke aber es war ein gutes auto wir hatten ein gutes qualifying und gute stopps f r ganz vorne hat es nicht gereicht aber es war f r uns eine solide nacht
7267919 momentan bleiben uns maximal zweite oder dritte pl tze brig
7267920 die beiden geben es sich ziemlich intensiv das sind auch die jungs die es zu schlagen gilt diese zwei k mpfen um die meisterschaft denn sie holen sich ja regelm ig die bonuspunkte
7267921 where blackboards turn white and the students get microphones baltimore sun
7267922 ich wei auch nicht was los war aber das handling war ziemlich schlecht wir haben nicht besonders gut ausgesehen darauf k nnen wir nicht gerade stolz sein und mir ist das schon etwas peinlich
7267923 ich hatte heuten einen sehr guten start und konnte mich so gleich zu beginn absetzen mit dem fahrzeug das mir mein team zur verf gung gestellt hat ging das auch problemlos der wagen war konstant bis zum ende des rennens dass wir hier in valencia schnell unterwegs sind haben wir gestern schon gemerkt wir haben wirklich eine sehr gute abstimmung gefunden die meisterschaft habe ich heute um lediglich einen punkt verpasst das ist schade aber ich denke dass wir nun in spa einen grund haben werden um zu feiern
7267924 mein team hat heute einen fantastischen job gemacht ich hatte eines der am besten abgestimmten fahrzeuge die ich je in einem rennen gefahren bin im letzten drittel ging es dann auch richtig gut nach vorne das war ein traum das einzige problem war dass es extrem hei war ich bin einfach nur gl cklich ber den zweiten platz ein gro es dankesch n an meine mannschaft
7267925 das rennen war heute extrem hart die bedingungen hier sind burtal besonders die hitze macht einem zu schaffen zudem musste ich richtig k mpfen um stefan zu berholen als ich vorbei war hatte jeroen schon einen enormen vorsprung es gab keine chance mehr an ihn heran zu fahren schlie lich musste ich noch j rg vorbeilassen er war einfach viel schneller als ich ein weiterer podiumserfolg im supercup ist jedoch eine tolle sache es w re sch n wenn mir dies auch in spa gelingt
7267926 es war ein gutes resultat nach einem harten kampf denn wir waren nicht besonders gut haben aber gute stopps und gute ver nderungen gemacht
7267927 wenn mir vor dem rennen jemand gesagt h tte dass wir ein top 10 resultat holen dann w re ich zufrieden gewesen
7267928 aber gegen halbzeit habe ich bemerkt dass heute sogar mehr drinnen war trotzdem war es ganz okay denn wir haben zwar keine punkte gutmachen k nnen aber auch keine verloren
7267929 zwei autos gerieten aneinander mein hintermann hat das nicht mitbekommen und hat mich einfach ber den haufen gefahren
7267930 wir hatten zu beginn bersteuern wir haben das repariert sind dann zur ckgekommen und haben ein gutes rennen gezeigt
7267931 wir waren ganz leicht an diesem durcheinander beteiligt aber meine jungs haben bei der reparatur einen tollen job erledigt
7267932 es war eine teamleistung wir hatten tolle stopps und das auto war gro artig wir haben ein top 10 resultat geholt und sind in der gesamtwertung zur ck in den top 12 das war f r uns eine richtig gute nacht
7267933 das team hatte sich vor dem rennen bei mir f r neue bremsbel ge entschieden deshalb k mpfte ich in den ersten zwei runden etwas mit der bremsbalance durch den positionskampf hinter mir konnte ich meinen vorsprung ausbauen ich wollte einfach ein sauberes rennen nach hause fahren um den gesamtsieg am ende will ich mir jetzt noch keine gedanken machen obwohl mein ziel n her r ckt

7267938 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7267939 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7267940 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7267941 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7267942 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7267943 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7267944 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7267945 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7267946 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first

7268023 its something we focused on all offseason and all camp we just want to help each other out sometimes the defense is going to be clicking
7268024 its going to be exciting when both sides are clicking
7268025 to start inside the red zone and have their offense come away with three points those are big scenarios for a defense
7268026 when you face a tough situation overcome those battles right there you have to challenge yourself and to come out on top in those that just sets the tone for the rest of the day
7268027 were a veteran group weve been together for three years
7268028 were supposed to lead were supposed to do what we did tonight
7268029 thats something weve got to make sure were aware of in those situations weve got to get a three and out and we didnt accomplish that
7268030 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7268031 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7268032 requires an explicit image format otherwise the image is interpreted as a tiff image e g dng image dng
7268033 we want a game with 11 versus 11 but when you lose that player its always going to be tough
7268034 after the first challenge the referee could have spoken to the kid
7268035 by the letter of the law you could probably say they are yellow cards but if theres going to be challenges like that were going to book every single player
7268036 when we went down to 10 men we worked so hard but when we conceded the goal just before half time it was a really tough job to get that belief back in them
7268037 it was a fantastic ball from franco miranda and billy mehmet gets a clean header and probably doesnt realise where his bearings are

7268040 dapat hindi sila mataranta dapat buksan yung hood tapos lagyan ng tubig
7268041 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7268042 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7268043 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7268044 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7268045 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad
7268046 the whole base command ay wala naman ata nabawas kung meron mang nabawas ay yung fighting sa north cotabato siyam ang patay at more than 10 ang injured or yung mga sugatan

7268049 i know people have high expectations because of dreamgirls i didnt have a particular concept in mind when i started working on the album i wanted it to show flexibility and versatility my voice has different characters and i looked at each song as having different stories since im an actress too
7268050 theyre all different sassy vulnerable loud and obnoxious dramatic romantic spiritual and theyre all a part of me
7268051 its tricky because i played a character in her 30s in the movie so the audiences heard me with more of an adult voice but im just 26 and i have a lot of other sides to show
7268052 in the song everyones telling me to pretty much throw the towel in on a relationship but this is a love thats worth fighting for an us against the world kind of thing
7268053 very sassy very much me i spoke with each of the writers and they created a feel for me for who i am this song represents one side of my personality this is something i would say it has attitude yet its playful
7268054 my first influence was my grandmother julia kate hudson and my earliest memory of singing publicly was at seven when i sang my first solo in church
7268055 then four years later i sang at my 90th birthday and the members of my family were like she doesnt sound like a little girl i didnt realize what i could do before that i used to walk around the house imitating brandy and groups like xscape and jade but whitney was always there from when i was a child i used to create my own little duets with her on i will always love you jennifer recalls
7268056 especially gladys knight i realized that a song has to be something i can feel for me to be able to sing it rather than sing at it how am i gonna move you if im not moved by the song im singing
7268057 i flew to atlanta slept in the big georgia dome and the first time i had to sing while others were auditioning too
7268058 i knew all along i was going to sing for a living that i was being prepared for something so far my career has been full of surprises and blessings back to back
7268059 im so fortunate to have an audience from idol and from dreamgirls all ages kids grandmothers gay straight and all races people may think they know what to expect from me but i want to show them im more than just a one trick pony when it comes to music
7268060 what happens if i quit the program do i have to pay back the loan
7268061 since we do not ask for your social security number we do not report defaults to credit or collection agencies however should you choose to quit the program you can do one of two things 1 pay back the loan plus the small interest fees or 2 while we hope you would not do this if you decided to keep the money you immediately become responsible for reporting it as income and paying taxes on it
7268062 we have been inundated with good wishes from our brother priests from parishioners and from many friends in the music world
7268063 it was our intention to make a record for posterity but imagine what we felt like when sony bmg popped up out of nowhere and expressed an interest fantastic unbelievable
7268064 theres less than 1 percent of the population in iowa that is african american
7268065 there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
7268066 but all the bullshit around me was what i knew i didnt want to be i used it as a springboard to try and do everything right
7268067 billy and ron reymann kristas first musical partner introduced me to camus that night and told him i was a singer
7268068 a couple of weeks later i was in his office singing him some songs i think it was sarah mclachlans angel sung acapella that won him over its been surreal ever since
7268069 my interests musically are extremely eclectic and i feel i can do anything stylistically
7268070 so we would just go to the studio and experiment find a chemistry just try things out until i felt comfortable with myself it was a real organic process and his support really gave me the confidence to just go in the studio and show who i was
7268071 i was in this room with like 30 executives and clive wasnt there yet i hear this voice from around the corner yelling did somebody say they were from brooklyn he was really amazing and i was encouraged by how much he loved it
7268072 i love my father and grandmother they both escaped an abusive households with my grandfather so i admire their strength but it was a hard childhood for me my father worked all the time so my brother sister and i were mainly raised by my grandmother who was very old school very conservative
7268073 i remember my body starting to change around 11 or 12 and it really made me reflect on not having a mom i didnt really know how to dress how to act like a girl my dad whom i love would buy me stretch pants and put my hair in a big braid
7268074 just brooklyn kid stuff tagging running away from home getting into fights i guess i was kind of an angry kid
7268075 i would lock myself in my bathroom and climb in the tub and just write
7268076 it was the only place where i felt truly safe
7268077 i think people recognized that i was different people from my hood they would come up to me and tell me that i didnt belong with them not in a bad way but in the sense that they knew i could do something good with my life instead of being caught up in the streets thats when i started to reconsider where i was going in my life
7268078 its about taking it back to where im from the whole collage of living in brooklyn
7268079 but its also about what art and writing and music means to me how i want to take back from my life what has been taken from me music was emotional therapy for me it is emotional therapy for me
7268080 this record is a good reflection of who i am as an artist songwriter
7268081 the others 2003s something i dreamed and 2005s wouldnt it be nice were too but this one is digging a little deeper
7268082 down a long dirt road in the woods just like i like it
7268083 although we did have a squirrel try to get in on the record im not sure if he made it or not
7268084 when i write a song i always like to imagine what it would sound like with a full production behind it this time i got to try a few different things to see which way i like it best its like having a kid and being able to dress it too
7268085 i wasnt sure what else there was left to say
7268086 but he got excited when he heard what i had and started coming up with lines and it just flowed from there
7268087 a guy by the name of donald overstreet wrote it when he was in prison he was married to my aunt at one time
7268088 my dad learned it from him and added his own touch to it now fiftysomething years later here it is it traveled a long way to get here
7268089 i loved the song as a kid and if you listen to the words its a true country song
7268090 for me the album is like turning on the radio and finding a station you want to hear
7268091 i want to get home as fast as i can these days
7268092 i liked the idea of calling the album thats how it is
7268093 because its direct and its real its one of the songs of mine that people really seem to like
7268094 anybody thats a good writer whether it be a songwriter or a poet or a screenwriter its an underestimated art
7268095 i sat and listened to records and played along with them
7268096 the first song i learned was get it on aka bang a gong in the us by t rex and then i started learning the beatles the first beatles song i learned was hey jude which was actually my mothers record she wasnt into music but she had that the commodores and simply red some of those soul records were really good
7268097 first eye opening experience to how the music industry really worked as opposed to just being a music fan listening to oasis there were all these wonderful instruments lying around i would never go to bed i would just stay up and play them what really got me into playing the piano was having access to the grand piano at the studio i never had a lesson in anything its all self taught and self researched
7268098 at this point i was finding my stride as a songwriter
7268099 because i wanted to write classic dare i say it pop music i was also so drawn to oasis because they came out and they were unashamedly writing pop songs music written by blokes for blokes great songs with loud guitars
7268100 id written eight songs for somebody elses records and came to los angeles to record them
7268101 i got a flat in santa monica and i stayed im always excited by change excited by movement inspired by things progressing
7268102 so i have no idea how it happened i flew to new york and by the time i got there five or six labels had called all asking to see me
7268103 its fair to say that not everything is going to make the grade
7268104 one of my favorite songs on the record one of the last songs i wrote before i moved here i was sitting in a coffee shop on my lunch break i was working in a shoe shop and there was this homeless guy sitting across the street singing theme song from rocky through a traffic cone i was a little bit inspired he was so at peace and it seemed such a random and inspiring piece of music to choose so i started jotting down the lyrics im always interested by the balance and the yin and yang of life how one mans crap is another mans diamonds i loved the juxtaposition of him completely at peace being exactly where he wanted to be making the most of his surroundings
7268105 its been good to hone in on the songs with a band
7268106 but a lot of things falling into the right place at the right time
7268107 i always want to make kids feel like they can look at what the characters are wearing and they can afford to go out and buy something for themselves i strive to inspire the watchers but its also important to have fun with clothing clothing can be fun and glamorous without making you feel alienated thats what i want to get across
7268108 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7268109 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determine guidelines for law enforcement

7268159 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
7268160 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free

7268206 im proud of our guys we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7268207 because if we didnt have great character we would not have been able to beat another team that had great character spain was fabulous everything we did we tried to stop them and we couldnt stop them completely it was a great basketball game where everybody involved played at the highest level and i think it brought out the best in us were thoroughly thankful for the opportunity to represent our country were ecstatic about winning the gold medal
7268208 words cant describe that feeling emotions goose bumps it was amazing to be crowned world champions olympic gold medalists it was great its been remarkable ive been enjoying the culture somewhat ive been enjoying my teammates more than anything ive had the chance to go see some of the other olympic events watch how fantastic athletes are around the world its an awesome awesome experience
7268209 i felt that i havent had a good game in the last two games so i really made it a point to come out be very aggressive from the start
7268210 i got into a rhythm early and it just kept going
7268211 every possession counted tonight for all 40 minutes every possession counted james stated
7268212 you couldnt take one possession off one second off if it wasnt for the determination and the will power we have in each other we wouldnt have pulled through and got this win much respect to spain but u s is back on top again
7268213 not only did we win this gold medal but it was probably one of the best olympic games ever
7268214 i kept thinking i might have been part of one of the best olympic basketball games for all time both teams never gave up both teams shot a high percentage a different player on each team always came down the court and made a great play

7268227 i personally believe that the single most important step we can take to resume a leadership role in international climate change efforts would be to make real progress toward a domestic emissions reduction regime for too long we have abdicated the responsibility to reduce our own emissions the largest single source of the problem we face today we have the worlds largest economy with the highest per capita emissions rather than leading by example we have retreated from international negotiations

7268243 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7268244 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7268245 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7268246 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security

7268265 if i could go back and talk to myself when i was 19 i would tell that girl not to use a solarium that melanoma is not a small cancer that you just have cut out and you will be fine
7268266 i may pass in another week or it could be two if i really fight it out i may even have six weeks left

7268273 australians dont like complicated lottery games theyre used to buying tickets for games offered by tatts like quick picks and powerball that are all over in five seconds
7268274 theyre not into drawing lucky lines or complex bingo games where you have snowballs in the middle and all the rest of it
7268275 intralot just didnt do the work to find out the australian mentality
7268276 sales are trending upwards as retailers and consumers become more familiar with the games and intralot is confident that it will achieve its forecasts
7268277 not everthing is fixed but overall its far better than it was
7268278 i think wed all have to acknowledge that when you have something new in a business venture its going take some time

7268344 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7268345 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7268346 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7268347 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7268348 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7268349 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up

7268462 we are already finding more tunnels ourselves more than 200 this year but we want to use their more successful methods of tunnel detection and destruction
7268463 it is the semi permanent closure of the rafah crossing after the arrival of hamas in gaza which has led to the increase in smuggling tunnels
7268464 before hamas seized power the crossing was opened at least twice a week allowing normal and legal passage of palestinians of aid and provisions

7268484 imagine how irritated i was to say the least when they purchased lonely planet
7268485 the lonely planet deal could be a deal too far for bbc worldwide it has nothing to do with the core business of bbc worldwide as far as i can tell
7268486 are they paying attention and being rigorous enough with some of these deals in our investigations of the lp lonely planet transaction frankly today we remain convinced this hasnt been scrutinised to the level of detail and certainly not publicly as it should be
7268487 you have to assume there will be distortion in the marketplace and people like us havent got a prayer of competing
7268488 is it going to come back and bite the bbc not just financially but reputationally
7268489 it could take just one serious fuck up for the bbc brand to be seriously damaged the organisation is in danger of getting out of control
7268490 long on rhetoric and self interest and short on fact
7268491 the idea that we are distorting the market is an absurd one

7268532 so thats what i did the next day i walked in told the guy near the door about my remote control he pointed me to a window at the end of this long room full of angry patrons at the window i waited all of thirty seconds for my turn and then had a wordless transaction i presented the old broken remote the woman behind the counter pulled out a new one batteries included and that was that no 3 needed so they get 3 stars instead so easy sure i had to go out of my way to get here but given its proximity to the shake shack rewarding yourself afterwards from the shack makes it worth the trip plus now i can channel surf with ease just wrapped up a day long experience in time warner hell fortunately for me it had a good ending but not before many threats of canceling service speaking to supervisors yelling at dispatchers and generally foaming at the mouth apparently if you make your threat firm enough they will take it seriously i wont give you all the sordid details of my exact cable problems but suffice it to say it was disruptive annoying enraging demented stupid and made me wanna march into their office throw their box on the floor and say fuck you

7268586 chris has been very good so far in this tournament he is running the floor very well and has been extremely active defensively he has been playing the 5 spot almost entirely this summer he has finished plays at the basket and i think has been their best rebounder the most impressive thing has been his communication it shows how much confidence and attention he has at the defensive end they went with smaller bigs who could get out and be active when guarding the screen and roll situations and he has not disappointed he is out quick and low and if he has to switch he has been able to keep the smaller players in front of him
7268587 i hope that this type of leadership can carry over to the raptors season if he can be a leader with the best players in the nba well that has to give him the confidence that he can do the same when he gets back with the raptors this team will win with good defense the celtics won last year with good defense hopefully the point has been sold to chris and he can sell the same to him teammates in toronto
7268588 anything is better than insisting that the savings of retired teachers and state employees be invested in risky ventures like toll roads
7268589 is rapidly turning into a bottomless pit for its financial backers
7268590 equal or better than something we can get in another project
7268591 there is a history of feasibility studies for toll roads being overly optimistic
7268592 of the 10 major private toll roads constructed since the mid 1990s nearly half carry far less traffic than projected some 4 billion in toll road bonds risk default over the next five years unless theyre refinanced
7268593 fitch says that the ever present possibility of state governments siphoning off surplus toll revenues or leveraging them for other borrowings prevents state owned turnpikes from achieving the aaa rating

7268602 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7268603 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7268604 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7268605 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7268606 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7268607 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7268608 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7268609 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7268610 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7268611 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7268612 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7268613 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7268614 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters

7268655 all men are equal but some are more equal that others
7268656 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7268657 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7268658 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7268659 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7268660 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7268661 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7268662 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7268663 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7268664 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7268665 that little 10 mph wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer
7268666 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through
7268667 i played really nicely the first nine holes and then quite average for a couple holes on the back nine
7268668 i made some bad decisions and it cost me dearly i think i was probably fortunate to come away with only two over on the back nine after two doubles and a bogey
7268669 i made about a 20 25 footer on no 10 and i thought oh wow i havent made too many of those in a while
7268670 its just nice to be on the right side of the cut ive missed four in a row
7268671 i drove it fairly well and wedged it within tap in distance a couple times and i played both par fives very well
7268672 i probably didnt hit it as good as today as i did yesterday but my putter really got hot
7268673 its great to get the putter rolling obviously it helps your score but it helps your psyche as well
7268674 its hard to complain with 67 but it was one of those rounds that really could have been something special
7268675 i had some opportunities on the front nine i let get away and then i had opportunities on the back some holes i didnt take advantage of its nice to be in the hunt but it was one of those could of should of
7268676 you know im not really against the chinese or the rich im really against everybody
7268677 the more the back and forth about ryder cup selections the more i wish the top 12 in points would make it the choices bring into it who knows when a player will start playing well or stop playing well age or youth experience really an advantage when the experienced player hasnt really beaten anybody in a long time horses for courses take the top 12 and play them proportionately to their team ranking based on ryder cup points
7268678 where is all this hype regarding monty coming from the guy has had a dreadful year by anybodys standards and yet some people are still saying that faldo should pick him i suspect a lot of those people are americans hoping to introduce a weakness to the european team apart from his game monty has had a torrid time in recent months in respect of his attitude and temper on the course and this would be brilliant for the american crowd as they have always been able to bring out the worst in monty which he tends to deserve judging by some of the current comments being made we will have calls being made for a captains pick for monty for the 2040 ryder cup assuming he isnt at the top of the order of merit
7268679 finally golf is enjoyable to watch again there is some suspense each week about who is going to emerge and we are getting to see the talent and character of some other players i am tired of all tiger all the time and actually am watching tournament golf more
7268680 there was the usual giant amount of focus on whether or not sergio garcia would finally win a major at the pga as nice as that would be for him it still wouldnt do much for the tour what made the old tour exciting was having four or five guys who had a legitimate shot to win each major and who actually pulled it off more than once in a blue moon tiger is the new jack but phil is not really the new arnie and theres no gary or lee or even billy to really push the excitement and rooting interest to where it used to be the tiger phil rivalry was fun for about three years but is becoming a fast fading memory padraig harrington is the first to step up to the plate in quite a while if he can grab even one or two majors more in the next year or two fan interest will definitely increase as for sergio its beginning to look like he will assume his role as the new monty
7268681 there has been talk about putting golf in the olympics we already see golf every weekend as well as baseball and basketball olympics should be about the things we never get a chance to see otherwise discus javelin running etc we already have tournaments that determine the best athletes in the major sports professional as well as amateur leave the olympics to the swimmers and gymnasts
7268682 padraig harrington is a great golfer a fine fellow a great competitor and i hate to question his achievements in the last month but when it comes to poy player of the year talk there appears to be a large white elephant in the corner of the room that everyone prefers to ignore without wins in either of the recent majors padraig harrington is not even a remote candidate for poy up to this point in the season his only claim to poy is the result of his back to back major wins were padraig not to distinguish himself further for the rest of the season there should be a problem making him poy for 2008

7268687 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
7268688 wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires
7268689 it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved
7268690 for the first time in history steel was melted by fire it is physically impossible
7268691 this is the first time that we are aware of that a building taller than about 15 stories has collapsed primarily due to fires
7268692 what we found was that uncontrolled building fires similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event the collapse of wtc7
7268693 even without the structural damage wtc 7 would have collapsed from fires
7268694 these uncontrolled fires had characteristics similar to those that have occurred previously in tall buildings
7268695 the fires in wtc 7 would have been controlled and the collapse prevented
7268696 connections that were designed to resist gravity loads but not thermally induced lateral loads
7268697 for the first time we have shown that fire can induce a progressive collapse
7268698 hypothetical blast events did not play a role in the collapse of wtc 7
7268699 found no evidence whose explanation required invocation of a blast event
7268700 would have resulted in a sound level of 130 db decibels to 140 db at a distance of at least half a mile
7268701 simple straightforward elegant and going along with what was observed i would say that the findings we have are incredibly conclusive that fire is why wtc 7 collapsed
7268702 before i tell you what we found id like to tell you what we did not find
7268703 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down the collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the buildings
7268704 no combination of debris damage fuel tank explosions and fires could inflict the kind of simultaneous damage to all the buildings columns required to make the building implode
7268705 the precision of such damage required to bring building 7 down into its footprint was especially great given the ratio of its height to its width and depth
7268706 anyone who has run a tight jar lid under water to help loosen it knows that the metal expands when it gets hot
7268707 heat also causes steel to lose strength and stiffness thermal expansion occurs at temperatures much lower than those required to reduce steel strength and stiffness
7268708 if you look at columns 79 80 and 81 three of the buildings central columns the floor area that theyre carrying is very large particularly column 79 which was carrying about 2000 sq ft of floor area
7268709 it was an interior column that failed followed by two more interior columns 80 and 81 then east to west so what youre seeing is an interior collapse then to the outside what youre getting is an impression of a controlled demolition but its not
7268710 we asked ourselves what is the minimum amount of charge we could use to bring the building down
7268711 and we found that even the smallest charge would release an extremely loud sound heard half a mile away
7268712 in order for the thermate reaction to melt steel to take place there has to be materials if you look at the amount needed at least 100 pounds for one column you need someone to get that amount in the building and place it and for the reaction to take place it is unlikely
7268713 longer beams can be subject to proportionally greater expansion effects
7268714 other tall buildings have burned for as long or longer in similar fires without collapsing when sprinklers either did not exist or were not functional so we knew from the beginning of our study that understanding what happened to building 7 on 9 11 would be difficult it did not fit any textbook description that you could readily point to and say yes thats why the building failed
7268715 in hindsight we knew that the building was evacuated but we didnt know that on that day
7268716 i am not surprised that there wasnt a lot of identifiable debris
7268717 but at the time we were concerned about terrorists who attacked our country and search and rescue i think the fact that they invesigators didnt collect wreckage was the least important activity that happened that day
7268718 it was as perfect as it could be for playing golf today it was just absolutely perfect
7268719 i was just fortunate today i kept it under the hole and made some nice putts at the same time
7268720 i was literally trying to hit the putt 6 inches and it just wiggled down
7268721 it looked like it was going to miss and then it drifted in it was one of those days where that kind of putt is falling
7268722 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
7268723 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
7268724 generally from the club point of view workability is tied to the mass properties of the clubhead
7268725 so you need a neutral center of gravity not significantly toward the heel or toe
7268726 add more than one package of pellets and remove the old boxes after a week

7268729 pick me up whatever you guys are getting because i have to go to bed
7268730 if all you clinton delegates don t support the entire ticket are you guys really going to stay home and protest the ticket
7268731 there seems to be an acrimonious atmosphere amongst the clinton delegates and you guys need to get united with the party
7268732 how long are you going to say that you are a clinton delegate
7268733 if the clinton delegates shut down the convention it will be bad for the dems nationwide senator clinton needs to stop this from happening
7268734 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
7268735 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
7268736 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
7268737 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
7268738 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
7268739 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
7268740 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
7268741 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
7268742 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
7268743 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
7268744 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
7268745 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
7268746 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
7268747 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
7268748 i like our odds were 50 percent right now over here we have four people playing two bulldogs
7268749 adams playing really well and if i can get by danny lee its going to get interesting
7268750 its fun to have your football team win but it would be really cool to have a georgia bulldog win the u s am
7268751 i told my dad i was going to land it just short and it was going to take one hop and roll right to it
7268752 i started hitting my irons a little better had chances to make birdie putts and kept having to make him beat me with birdie putts rather than always having to scramble to get up and down

7268813 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
7268814 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
7268815 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
7268816 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
7268817 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video

7268864 el a o pasado nos la hicieron pasar pero muy mal en torrevieja fue un tiempo muy duro para todos nosotros y quiero volver a recuperar las buenas sensaciones en un buen club como el de molina al que tengo que agradecer su comportamiento en todo momento y al que espero devolverle todo su esfuerzo con mi trabajo
7268865 creo que tenemos muy buen equipo y podemos optar a luchar por el ascenso
7268866 es un orgullo llevar el escudo del bar a por todo el mundo
7268867 la pretemporada despierta mucha ilusi n y ganas de trabajar son sesiones a n muy primarias en cuanto a la puesta a punto f sica y en cuanto a los inicios de conceptos hay muchas ganas por parte de todos tanto por parte de los j venes que se han incorporado a nuestra disciplina como del resto de los jugadores de la plantilla
7268868 s por un lado hay una buena cantidad de jugadores que son propiamente del primer equipo y por el otro el n mero de jugadores es muy elevado porque hemos decidido que muchos j venes formen parte de estos primeros entrenamientos la verdad es que est n con nosotros para ver c mo est n y tambi n para que se sientan parte de este proyecto
7268869 las primeras horas con los tres est n siendo muy satisfactorias las calidades que les han llevado a ser fichados quedan claramente diferenciadas en los entrenamientos a pesar de que hay otros que forman parte de la competici n y que a n no hemos podido ver
7268870 son jugadores que no s lo ocupan la posici n de base sino que son exteriores en general con el baloncesto de hoy en d a desaparece de alguna manera la posici n cl sica de uno y por lo tanto son jugadores de la l nea exterior que pueden jugar juntos son jugadores adem s que pueden ocupar la posici n de dos puntualmente y que se pueden complementar son jugadores exteriores
7268871 de momento s lo puedo tener palabras de admiraci n no s lo por c mo nos han salido las cosas durante el verano que la verdad es que pienso que nos han salido bastante bien sino tambi n por su dedicaci n y su trabajo ha estado todo el verano trabajando muchas horas aqu incluso ha habido d as en los que ha sido hasta altas horas de la madrugada y la verdad es que nuestra relaci n profesional sigue una l nea muy similar vemos el baloncesto de una manera muy parecida y eso tambi n ayuda adem s la predisposici n por parte de los dos es m xima para convivir bien y por lo tanto s lo tengo palabras de satisfacci n en este sentido
7268872 comenzando por el vigente campe n de liga el tau continuando por el real madrid que hace dos temporadas fue campe n el unicaja o el dkv joventut todos salen con una etiqueta de equipos favoritos junto a nosotros no creo que cambie demasiado eso
7268873 pienso que ser muy prematuro porqu tenemos algunos jugadores importantes que se incorporan m s tarde otros incluso en la liga catalana y seguramente no estar n para jugar por eso igual es un poco prematuro no siempre cuando comienzas bien una temporada quiere decir que despu s ir s bien pienso que en este sentido es prematuro pero nosotros lucharemos tanto en la liga catalana como la supercopa para intentar ganar
7268874 pienso que el nuestro es un grupo bastante complicado con mucha igualdad y este nuevo sistema de competici n no te permite relajarte en la primera fase donde antes s que se permit an algunos errores ahora desde el primer d a tienes que estar muy atento y para nosotros el primer partido vendr despu s de la gira por estados unidos y ser un partido francamente importante yo lo tengo anotado en mi libreta este primer partido en francia puede marcar una poco el desarrollo de la euroliga
7268875 la euroliga de la pr xima temporada es espectacular en cuanto a la calidad individual de algunos jugadores despu s veremos c mo encajan todos ellos en los sistemas de cada equipo pero individualmente es cierto que hay una cantidad de jugadores de primera l nea que har n de la acb y de la euroliga dos competiciones de muy alto nivel

7268918 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7268919 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7268920 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7268921 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7268922 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7268923 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7268924 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7268925 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7268926 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7268927 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters

7269074 the international stuff is important for chinas longer term goals and its strategic positioning in the world
7269075 but the olympics are most important for showing the people of china how great and powerful their leaders are that they can deliver an olympics which is a success and therefore the position of the communist party within china is strengthened and legitimised
7269076 in general chinese people are very proud of the olympics even the ones who are dissatisfied with their lives what happens is people are angry with their local party officials for screwing them over with land deals or whatever but they have complete faith in the higher officials in beijing
7269077 the olympics is almost the pinnacle of that and president hu jintaos party are demonstrating their power at the highest level so people are proud nationalistic and patriotic
7269078 a lot of what you see is a mask but its a very effective and persuasive mask what you dont see is every factory within 50km of beijing has been shut down for the last month you dont see that the chinese military has been busy seeding the clouds so that the rains will wash away the air pollution what you dont see is that a million migrant workers have been moved out of town because theyre an embarrassment to the government the authoritarian state in china doesnt seem to trust its own people
7269079 the ioc seems oblivious to the fact that theyre holding the games in a repressive environment
7269080 i think in the long run people will look back at the olympics as a major milestone in chinas opening outward both in terms of its involvement in the global economy and also its acceptance of international morals and standards so i think the impact will be a positive one generally
7269081 but to demonstrate that we need to show sensitivity towards historical context and less of the presumptions associated with a euro centric mindset indulging in facile china bashing has become fashionable of late but i would argue that the success of the beijing olympics offers us plenty of reasons why we should celebrate chinas re emergence onto the international stage

7269173 o resultado foi ruim para a gente porque poder amos ter sa do com a vit ria o atl tico mostrou uma fragilidade muito grande mas n o era o nosso dia vamos em busca dos tr s pontos contra o ipatinga
7269174 meu rendimento j foi melhor contra o gr mio mas estou tranquilo porque sei que com um pouco mais de treino e entrosamento vou fazer muito sucesso no flamengo
7269175 a vit ria sobre o palmeiras trouxe paz e confian a ao nosso grupo mas agora temos que manter o embalo em casa o nico resultado que interessa a vit ria
7269176 conversamos muito vimos nossos erros e nos corrigimos a tempo tem um turno inteiro pela frente ainda
7269177 sei que a estrada vai ser sempre dif cil mas estamos a para cobrar muito j houve uma cobran a agora para mudar para fazer um time pelo menos competitivo
7269178 a disposi o dos jogadores fruto da motiva o deles o elenco bom e eu gosto e no momento que todos voltarem do departamento m dico vamos ter um rendimento maior
7269179 pelo rendimento do primeiro tempo se jogarmos da mesma forma contra o atl tico mineiro temos a possibilidade conseguir a vit ria
7269180 o time teve atitude procurou jogar fez o que v nhamos pedindo mas deu tudo certo para o advers rio at no chut o mas sa mos de cabe a erguida bem diferente da derrota para o coritiba tivemos um bom volume mas n o conseguimos o gol
7269181 conseguimos buscar o resultado ainda no primeiro tempo mas n o soubemos administrar na segunda etapa criamos oportunidades botamos press o em cima do advers rio mas n o conseguimos marcar
7269182 mesmo se o s o paulo ganhar todos os jogos dentro de casa n o ter os pontos suficientes para ser campe o por isso para fazer a diferen a temos de ganhar em casa e somar pontos fora tamb m
7269183 n s vamos encontrar o couto pereira lotado at pela campanha deles o coritiba est pr ximo do s o paulo e vamos sofrer press o normal no come o do jogo mas acredito que se n o sofrermos gols em 20 minutos teremos condi es de igualar o jogo para venc los
7269184 o campeonato ainda tem 17 rodadas e n o podemos dar um passo maior que a perna
7269185 you have to use these top end machines to know how amazing they are
7269186 acreditamos que todo jogo seguinte ser dif cil e contra o santos n o ser diferente uma grande oportunidade para a gente reabilitar independentemente da situa o do santos sempre uma partida complicada
7269187 acho que no momento o kleber pereira o jogador mais perigoso do santos precisamos de uma aten o especial em cima dele que vive um bom momento tem tamb m o kl ber que chama muito o jogo e tem habilidade com a perna esquerda a aten o maior nesses dois sem esquecer dos outros

7269209 for when gentiles who do not have the law by nature do the things in the law these although not having the law are a law to themselves who show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them

7269253 the feeling is particularly acute in the leveraged loan market where during the bull years of 2006 and early 2007 investors felt emboldened to take on excessive risk
7269254 as a result the rate of defaults instances where a company is unable to make its interest payments or meet the obligations in its debt agreements is higher in the loan market than it is in the junk bond market which has traditionally been perceived as the riskier of the two markets
7269255 what that tells you about is the tremendous amount of poor quality financing in the easy money period of 2004 to 2007 and now when the economy slows down these companies have way too much debt and theyre hitting the wall
7269256 it also tells you why loans have been trading in general at a substantial discount to face value

7269287 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7269288 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem
7269289 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources council should provide money to employ security guards
7269290 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police

7269305 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us
7269306 under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7269307 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7269308 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7269309 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked

7269314 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it

7269317 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous

7269319 here we are in the situation in which the finish is questionable and the ultimate judge of truth is refusing to make public information that may be nothing short of catastrophic for phelps omega phelpss other sponsors and the americans in general who certainly do not want their wonder boys amazing feat tarnished
7269320 this issue may end up being very damaging to phelps omega and the u s a sadly it could have been avoided with careful thought and basic ethical advice
7269321 its our job to provide the results fina decides what can be published or not fina said it was a no go

7269325 the result of the race as declared by the federation is final and the i o c has no reason to question it
7269326 that sort of stuff is an issue that fina deals with
7269327 we dont get involved with what happens in the pool like that
7269328 i dont see how the company decides the outcome of a race
7269329 given that everyone participating in the swimming events was subject to the same timing technology it seems to eliminate any impropriety

7269344 i know everybodys scared right now but its just so over the top
7269345 mortgage debt is viewed as much riskier now than it was a couple of years ago during the housing boom
7269346 probably about a year ago that would have been fine
7269347 the tightening of the guidelines by fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of the mortgage collapse have had a rippling effect with all lenders and all loan types
7269348 its very difficult to imagine a scenario in which the federal government doesnt step in
7269349 i wanted to do the 100 mile but i didnt train hard enough for it
7269350 it really gets kind of complicated if youre type i and doing a long bike ride
7269351 were trying to change that mentality and show how people can live with it well
7269352 one of our other riders said im not a great athlete but im faster than the person on my couch
7269353 im amazed at how many people i do know with diabetes
7269354 ive had a lot of family members with diabetes and this keeps me away from it
7269355 theyre changing the rules so much and everybody is going to the no huddle and now theyve changed the facemask rule even if you touch it its 15 yards
7269356 people want to see points but i think well evolve back to where well catch up if everybody starts doing the same thing on offense you tend to get used to that you start to identify the type of people you need on the defense to help you be successful and you recruit to that end
7269357 the no 1 thing in the big 12 is offense
7269358 you dont hear too much about defenses so if you have a stout defense and you can compete against any offense out here and you have an ok offense youre going to win
7269359 as a defensive guy thats the sport we live in
7269360 any way we can sell more tickets because at the end of the day this is a business
7269361 i dont think theres any question by and large the rules favor the offense
7269362 how many times do you see offensive pass interference not very many
7269363 its like the nfl theyve made it more offensive friendly if you coach defense youre just going to have to understand that
7269364 you have to be conscious when youre running down the field to tackle missouri all american jeremy maclin whos faster than you
7269365 thats a real hard thing as a football player to do
7269366 the only rule i have a problem with is the horse collar rule which is bull and im not afraid to say its bull
7269367 youre pulling somebody down and theyre at the goal line and you cant grab him and pull him
7269368 thats basically the rule just saying you cant be yanked down and thats bull
7269369 people are going to sit down and say lets do this and theyll start getting more creative in terms of having less big guys in the game and dropping and rushing and mixing up your blitzes and where youre coming from
7269370 in the age of everybody having a tight end outside as a wide receiver and things like that you have to get the fastest guys you can on the field
7269371 so thats kind of what were aiming for to identify those guys who can get on the field and run
7269372 everybody here has been in the system three years now
7269373 were not putting in a whole lot of new stuff just a few new calls here and there but if everybody just plays smarter and understands the concepts and the schemes of the defense that allows you to go smarter and make plays

7269594 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7269595 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7269596 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7269597 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7269598 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7269599 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7269600 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7269601 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress

7269651 our approach has been exceedingly effective for both young men and women we are uniquely positioned to give clients the wake up call of wilderness therapy as well as the counseling services and tools to stay clean and sober permanently
7269652 we are the only wilderness program out there that teaches daily living skills and helps clients acclimate to being in a community setting prior to discharge so the transition onward doesnt come as such a culture shock that gives each individual a chance to see how recovery will look for them not just in the wilderness but back in real life
7269653 by living and working with these young people day and night both in the unfamiliar wilderness setting and familiar base camp environment we can go beyond words and talk therapy and actually see how their substance abuse and co occurring issues impact their daily lives
7269654 in just two years we have established a strong national reputation for clinical excellence
7269655 our therapists travel all over the country to attend conferences develop new skills and improve the quality of their services their hard work has helped us make a name for ourselves in a relatively short period of time
7269656 the substance abuse field is relatively young so there is always room for improvement
7269657 one of our hallmarks is that were never satisfied with the status quo we are always evolving and finding new ways to provide the highest quality clinical services and state of the art treatment when it comes to substance abuse and co occurring mental health issues

7269670 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
7269671 we are really recognising e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
7269672 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
7269673 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
7269674 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
7269675 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
7269676 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
7269677 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly

7269727 is one of congress most knowledgeable and respected voices on national security
7269728 brings far more to the ticket than foreign policy experience he has a powerful personal story and bidens record in the area of crime and the judiciary is another asset democrats can point to that will go beyond his foreign policy credentials
7269729 because of accreditation policies designed to ensure continued and increasing economic and professional benefits for professors and deans the common man either will not gain admission to law school in the first place or will be saddled with so much debt upon graduation that a good chunk of his future will be a constant struggle

7269731 the three groups have coordinated their activities there was vast and continuing overlap in their leaders with many of the same persons being leaders in either two or all three of the groups
7269732 the big three accomplished their mercenary purposes the losers were students that paid the bills through their soaring tuition minorities that were priced out of attending law schools and the public
7269733 into institutions that serve only the upper middle class and the upper class while knowingly largely keeping out minorities the lower middle class the poor immigrants and people in mid life they are intent on keeping the legal academy and the legal profession the preserve of the white and the wealthy
7269734 never permitted to take the bar or at best in about 15 or so states can take the bar only three five or 10 years after graduation
7269735 schools that serve minorities and the poor would be allowed to exist and their graduates would be allowed to take bar exams
7269736 more law schools that would look like the massachusetts school of law
7269737 schools built around this alternative model would produce capable lawyers at a much lower tuition which would be good for the students and good for society

7269756 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7269757 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7269767 rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11
7269768 i did say that and at the time i meant it but having now spent a great deal of time with obama i am convinced that hes ready for the job ahead hes a quick study and he has immersed himself in the details of foreign policy hes already shown far better judgment on these issues than john mccain has shown
7269769 i think this will be a big issue in the supreme court before long

7269796 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7269797 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it
7269798 they scored runs for him early and he filled up the strike zone which is what youre supposed to do when you have a lead
7269799 a lot of the time especially at this time of the year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time
7269800 its kind of cool that it was here in toronto where i started where i had number one
7269801 my dream was to have four gold medals around my neck by the time we finished our last game here in beijing
7269802 thats what usa basketball is all about passing the torch
7269803 your legacy of course starts with gold medals lisa has four no one can ever take that away from her
7269804 shes a major reason why basketball in the u s not just olympic wise but wnba wise is what it is today
7269805 i knew i had to come out and play very physical jump start our team so i tried to come out and be aggressive and let our team know i was there ready to fight the fight for us
7269806 i was really thinking more about candace and sylvia those are the babies and just the fact i felt good about what i was able to do to contribute as a leader in helping them

7269811 were happy with what he did and we got some timely hitting thats the kind of life i want to see
7269812 there was a little more energy in the dugout tonight
7269813 you still have to play for pride even though were out of the race we still have to go out and bust our butts every day

7269818 as i have done thousands of times i forwarded the message on my private e mail account to people i know
7269819 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this county and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes
7269820 it was not done with any malicious intent but unfortunately some people have attempted to make it a political issue
7269821 maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves american citizens will find the backbone to start speaking and voicing the same truths

7269823 shows the mark on the actual goods or packaging for the goods
7269824 a tag or label for the goods a container for the goods a display associated with the goods or a photograph of the goods that shows use of the mark on the goods
7269825 the mere inclusion of a phone number internet address and or mailing address on an advertisement describing the product is not in itself sufficient to meet the criteria for a display associated with the goods there must be an offer to accept orders or instructions on how to place an order

7269839 false claims of use of the mark on goods or services wherever they may appear are essential to the integrity of the application and registration process
7269840 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7269841 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7269842 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7269843 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7269844 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7269845 we dont say that anymore after what they did to us
7269846 did we go to them to fight no they came to us they used to be our neighbors now they are foreigners
7269847 we are neighbors with the georgians but we have no ethnic roots in common

7269866 removing speculators from our oil market is one way releasing a small amount of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve is another
7269867 i agree with t boone pickens a well known oil man that this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
7269868 we must encourage responsible drilling here at home we must invest heavily in renewable energy sources and we must conserve energy where we can
7269869 we should move quickly to remove restriction on oil exploration in alaska oil and gas exploration offshore oil shale in the rockies tar sands in utah and for other opportunities to increase our energy supply
7269870 by giving businesses and individuals the financial incentive to put renewable energy strategies to work
7269871 we should proceed with new nuclear generating plants and resolve the waste disposal issue
7269872 a new hampshire power plant in the seacoast burns wood not coal due to legislation i wrote when serving in the new hampshire legislature
7269873 this will require more drilling both on land and sea and i believe we have the environmental policies in place to provide reasonable levels of protection to these areas
7269874 impeach the president rescind the policy of pre emption and begin a robust diplomatic effort with iran that would significantly reduce the risk of war thus reducing energy prices
7269875 lower costs for energy health care and food as well as lower taxes preferably a flat tax will help to stimulate the economy for the short term and bring it long term stability
7269876 the most important things we can do to secure our economic future include balancing the budget lowering taxes and getting government out of the way of business expansion
7269877 in order to avoid further bankruptcies caused by food or health care costs
7269878 gives people back more of their own money through tax cuts and make spending reductions to keep our budget balanced
7269879 while i am concerned about the current economic state this is not the great depression and the failure of indymac bank is an isolated event
7269880 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america

7269883 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7269884 the whole team walked together side by side to win this game
7269885 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7269886 im more disappointed to miss the opportunity to have people fired up about mountain biking back at home

7269895 we cant get injunctive relief preventing them from using it in the trademark office nor can we collect damages
7269896 registration doesnt change the basic priority priority is based on use
7269897 there have upon information and belief already been instances of actual confusion including confusion among sophisticated customers
7269898 you cant trademark a geographic region this is the same thing that happened in leelanau county
7269899 theres not much of a likelihood of confusion when you have your products sold at the winery

7269905 the selection of a business web address is a crucial decision businesses should consider all available options before purchasing their primary domain name as the number of registered domains increases its often the case that the best available domains belong to less obvious suffixes and it is always advisable to seek external opinion on what a domain could suggest about your business
7269906 necessarily implies that the complainants rights predate the respondents registration
7269907 obviously contrary to the intent of the policy and to trademark law generally
