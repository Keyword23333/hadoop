4780018 all human social organizations are networks these are families teams council committees platoons communities parties commissions tribes corporations departments governments and so forth and so on through wide and diverse configuration of human interaction and their abstraction they are all networks all forms of human organization have roles links and exchanges networks are the canonical model of human social interaction this is a basic concept unique network patterns and configurations exists and emerge as a convenient abstraction we assign names to these like group cabal body politic coterie neighborhood etc to describe the unique patterns and properties of the specific network to pose whether a team or community is a network is utterly ridiculous it is like asking if matter is made up of atoms molecules and elements silly it is entirely appropriate to assert the properties of the network and question if they rise to threshold of the particular and convenient abstraction of human organization such as a team or community this is among the frontiers of the relatively new science of networks

4780088 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4780089 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
4780090 radiometric methodologies would have to be out by a factor of 3 4 of a million
4780091 polystrate trees prove several things 1 the layers that they penetrate did not take millions of years to form 2 coal does not take millions of years to form since polystrate trees sometimes penetrate multiple seams 3 coal is formed from floating trees not peat 4 the rock strata between the coal layers did not take millions of years to form 5 the fossils embedded within the strata do not represent millions of years of evolution
4780092 1 that is not all that hard to explain 2 hello one ringy dingy two ringy dingy i dont either apology accepted if that is what it was like i said we can move beyond kindergarten if you will stop throwing your bottle out of the crib and screaming for your binky
4780093 starlight has not arrived here after millions of years whether big bang or creation the stars have stretched out from a central point accelerated to where they are and continue to expand starlight cannot be used to date anything
4780094 the age of the universe has changed many times with the age of the earth at one time the sun was known to be 90 000 000 miles closer to earth than now claimed
4780095 the other side of the coin is that as of yet there is no evidence outside of manipulating the bible for a 6000 year old earth
4780096 so it is easily possible that a polystrate tree could form 300 million years ago and then have further deposits to complete the coal seams
4780097 also you have made a point that these trees do not have roots do you have any ideas because i dont this is a question for both sides of the camp to answer
4780098 no it is the peat layers being compressed that is a much more obvious conclusion this invalidate 1 to 5
4780099 where are these coal seams and you have yet to answer my question as to the lady involved with the
4780100 it questions the assumption that the speed of light has always been the same this is a reasonable assumption since we have absolutely no evidence that the speed of light has ever been different or even of any mechanisms that can increase the speed
4780101 if you had checked into the msh information you would already know what i was saying here i did not say that all of the logs sank to form the coal rather it appears that occasionally one sinks heavy end first to become a polystrate tree penetrating multiple strata but the coal itself is composed mostly of the bark that falls from the trees as they are moved to and fro by the violent action of wind waves and tides that is why the coal beds are thin and seldom more than a few feet in thickness logs embedded through coal seams are petrified permineralized coalified depending on temperature chemical conditions and sediment content yes the trees provide the carbon
4780102 i never manipulate the bible i take it as written
4780103 our camp has already answered the question the trees were floating not growing they had been ripped loose from the soil where they grew and many of them lacked not only roots and rootlets but the entire root ball violent global flood action is the only condition capable of producing such evidence on such a grand global scale
4780104 there was no evidence of a peat bog and nobody claimed that all of the logs were coalified nothing is invalidated
4780105 the flood waters were upon the earth for about a year most logs will float for more than a year bark that is rubbed off will not float for very long ive seen bays on the west coast full of floating logs and not a shred of bark on any of them i think the logs mostly ended up on top of the ground and rotted to form soil
4780106 im not your babysitter and im tired of you spitting your pablum all over the place if you had actually checked the links and read the quote your first question wouldnt have been asked and you wouldnt have been ignorant enough to word the second question the way you did
4780107 light has been manipulated like that in a lab because they are making it travel through different mediums which distort the speed of light while traveling through a vacuum like space the speed of light is constant the constant speed of light is one of the fundamental premises of special relativity
4780108 well there is no statement in the bible that says 5000 6000 years or whatever it is so you had to manipulate it
4780109 sorry for the cut and paste i know you dont like that sort of stuff but i was at work and had limited time i find that by using a scientists own words would be more credible to you apparently i was wrong but if you want to leave red shift alone fine by me it only works with the big bang any way and you seem to relise that thats a bad theory all around
4780110 god exists xxxxx is the only correct religion and god made the world and its diversity
4780111 ob ser va tion noun 1 an act or instance of noticing or perceiving 2 an act or instance of regarding attentively or watching 3 the faculty or habit of observing or noticing 4 notice to escape a persons observation
4780112 i typed that out just for you youve used this term quite a bit and since its a key ingrediant in the scientific method that we have to observe what is happening the moment we stop observing and go only on a hypothisis or theory we are leaving the realm of science you would agree wouldnt you
4780113 lets see what we can observe even with the worlds most powerful telescope a star is still a dot of light
4780114 theres a good doc on it also another weird theory theres your favorite word is that the sun is hollow and close up examinations of sun spots reveal this but what do you care for such things being taught in a un classroom see robert muller you want to talk of the spped of light
4780115 roughly 8 min and 34 sec it takes to get here from the sun i remember that from school didnt look it up but as my brothers have already stated the speed of light is effected by gravity mass and acceleration a lab in i believe australia im guessing not gonna look it up just for you stopped light in a lab not just stopped it but speeded it up considering light exists as a particle and a ray it would be folly to think its speed is a constant but then again they said the speed of sound would never be broken just the fact that a black hole and no one really knows what one is can trap light clearly states that the speed is not a constant
4780116 oh cosmology is really a religon when you think about it i mean its all about where we came from and how everything began it just dosent claim one way is the only way
4780117 no doofus all i had to do was get out my calculator and add up the years in the genealogies duh contrived indeed the information about coal forming from bark has been around for years yet your crowd keeps pushing the peat bog fantasy which has never been proven to produce any quantity of coal get a life
4780118 well it was broadcast in the papers of the world and on every network
4780119 no that still only tells you that what your seeing is a dot of light there is no evidence anywhere that what we see has any corelation to our own sun and this in no way shows the size of the universe scientists keep looking for the edge of the universe and theyll never find it
4780120 plasma physics and the hollow sun would go along way to this forum it is called conclusive proof that evolution is a myth not the bible
4780121 a religion is a set of tenets and practices often centered upon specific supernatural and moral claims about reality the cosmos and human nature and often codified as prayer ritual or religious law
4780122 plus cosmology has a lot to do with this forum it is called conclusive proof that evolution is a myth and cosmology is your genesis
4780123 the moment we stop observing and go only on a hypothisis or theory we are leaving the realm of science you would agree wouldnt you
4780124 how would it prove god how would it prove genesis
4780125 samir nasri had a good game and we are happy with the three points
4780126 we always looked in control and i always thought the second goal would come
4780127 but west brom defended very well and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
4780128 we didnt get off to a great start with them scoring early in the game but they are a great side
4780129 but once we got a grip of the game we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves

4780135 i can kind of enjoy and savour that new artist experience you know you have to be committed to it people dont know anything about my music and thats not their fault
4780136 i occasionally get those little butterflies but at the same time im actually more in a happy place it feels really wonderful i dont have expectations im not going over with expectations im just wanting to give my songs to more people
4780137 as if i ever have a conversation these days that isnt jetlagged
4780138 im like walking around the plane going what flight are you on
4780139 hes so supportive i love that everyone is taking his music in i love that theyre getting to know him
4780140 weve both been really good at really making sure we both stay ourselves i do my work a certain way he does his a certain way we can feed off each other were both songwriters were both performers thats how we met were stronger than ever we can both relate to it
4780141 im not a 16 or 17 year old girl anymore and im not a 19 year old girl thats just had the shock of her life im in a place where ive grown up
4780142 i couldnt have gone over with either of the other albums innocent eyes and mistaken identity because im not in that place anymore
4780143 i go back in my mind and there are things that still stick with me i remember thats whats scary and other things arent scary it was intense
4780144 extremes always follow me though it was very extreme being no 1 as well as being sick
4780145 i was speaking somewhere the other day saying i can go back into that time of my life talking about cancer but i am a musician lets talk about music but at the same time i still lived it it was real life
4780146 the funny thing is i have never puffed a cigarette in my life
4780147 i dont drink much but ill have the occasional glass of wine
4780148 yeah i am a good girl its not like im painting myself in a way that im not
4780149 at the same time it doesnt mean you cant be a good girl and have fun
4780150 you know my make up artist gave me a song which she says is my theme song its
4780151 its funny because the face in question is one ive always been quite happy with
4780152 people are forgetting i was a 16 or 17 year old girl when i first came out as a singer you know i may be only 23 but a lot changes i think its just that i grew up and sometimes people find that hard i think if youve seen from when i started i look exactly the same just an older version of that also you change a lot going through chemo changes from different drugs that happen
4780153 all those extremities made me who i am today i feel an inner strength in me right now which has been so fantastic i feel very comfortable in my own skin
4780154 i get to sing so much more over there at the moment so many places to be able to sing sing sing instead of talking all the time im singing all the time and i really love that
4780155 i feel like im getting to start again sometimes i get more nervous when i come home
4780156 thats the really exciting bit thats what i do it for to see all the peoples faces singing the songs
4780157 you have to get a bit more fit because you cant go on stage for two hours and go huuuuhffh she makes a loud puffing noise i train every day leading up to tour running and outdoor activities but you know what im happiest when im on stage i just really enjoy it now
4780158 when i was a kid i had a dream and i thought ok it has to be perfect
4780159 but some performances are better than others youve just got to let go of it
4780160 its kind of been one of the most creative times ive had for so long ive been writing like crazy when im over there because i get a bit more time
4780161 i kind of feel like at least now it feels real again no expectations

4780171 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us
4780172 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down for another night out there so we got prepared to stick through another tough night
4780173 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm
4780174 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking oh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried
4780175 and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break
4780176 it was amazing yesterday morning to again hear the sound of a helicopter we heard it fly over the back of the ridge
4780177 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again
4780178 we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up
4780179 finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility when it did finally see us everyone was just jumping up and down cheering
4780180 they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4780181 its a new ea five years ago if you told us we were going to be working with ea id have thought you were a little crazy
4780182 but the way they just put so much more emphasis on external development and really partnering is important theyre not just all about the games theyre making its just being smart i mean who wouldnt want to publish the orange box even if they didnt develop it or rock band right
4780183 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic
4780184 this is a cautionary tale about how journalism sometimes gets practiced in contemporary america

4780208 when we saw that chopper there was a lot of tears and screaming
4780209 i have always been aware of how dangerous it can be and how vulnerable you can be out there because i think at times im a bit invincible
4780210 but no i would never give up going out climbing or walking
4780211 i was so shocked when i heard from him he just said im safe now im just calling you to say im safe
4780212 we could see the chopper but you cant make contact or get help
4780213 then it goes away and you know it will be night time soon and were stuck here for another night
4780214 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave

4780216 for paul mccartney a pre nup would have saved a lot of heartache in court

4780219 i do use it at my clinic but i dont follow the extreme adf i will give clients a strict low calorie diet followed by high calorie days

4780224 hollys got a bit sensitive hair after smashing my finger in india its a bit hampered so thats my excuse anyway

4780231 they loved it out there it was good just to get away from things
4780232 youre 160km away from anywhere so it was good to have space and come to terms with everything
4780233 when i was younger i started a season on a regular basis but this has all changed since i came to newcastle due mainly to a couple of freak accidents
4780234 the first was when i broke my metatarsal at spurs trying to score and then when i damaged the cruciate ligaments in my right knee in the first minute of that world cup match with sweden
4780235 but last season while i had the odd problem or two especially with my hernias i felt that i played in the majority of games and i finished the season strongly
4780236 i also scored quite a few goals and this has given me a lot of belief and as a result if i can stay fit i know i will help myself to a few more goals in the coming season
4780237 i feel that 100 caps and 50 goals are both gettable targets if i can stay injury free and keep playing well for newcastle united
4780238 sir bobby charlton is englands leading scorer with 49 goals but 50 sounds better
4780239 but i must stress that i want to play well first and foremost for my club my main aim is to be successful with newcastle and the bonus of international football comes after that
4780240 its a great honor for me like alan shearer to have captained both newcastle and england but england have three good men in steven gerrard rio ferdinand and john terry and plenty of other candidates
4780241 he was upset and worried but hes glad im with my mum and dad
4780242 i said forget about me and think about yourself think about the race and stay relaxed

4780246 hes hoping for the best and hes going to give it his best shot

4780255 i think you will get a good and sympathetic hearing from the cricket fraternity in london but what use is that if the powers that be wont let tours take place
4780256 re the media i agree your remarks there is no doubt the packer protagonists are cleverly using the press for propaganda purposes i see no clear cut solution but i believe the only hope is for you personally to see the executive heads of all these papers privately and explain the position to them and ask for their support in the interests of national cricket and i think it ought to be done well in advance of next summer to bob parish on the subject of bowlers throwing february 1969 but i think it germane to say that throwing has been a recurring evil for nearly 100 years and if modern legislators can devise ways and means of curing this evil once and for all they will do cricket a great service moreover i think it is powerful evidence in support of my view that we would be crazy now to revert to the old situation where we had no definition
4780257 i cant very well answer that i am on channel 9

4780265 we won the match playing in our own rhythm we couldnt score on our chances in the previous match but today we did pretty well
4780266 we got the momentum after scoring a goal in an early minute and we were able to perform very well that is a big element of our win today

4780287 but for all the things i loved about this episode and even the things im still a bit uncertain about i cant believe how poorly they handled that last scene between rory and logan and i suppose the argument could be made that it went down the way it did because it was all so abrupt and unexpected but that still doesnt excuse how awkward and really kind of awful that scene was
4780288 i like being with you but im not willing to let you stake any claim in my life youre nice to have around and i like the feeling of being in love but really cant we just keep things open

4780292 the next scene where rory and lorelai talk about it also felt hollow and the soft little sigh rory let out when she looked at her apartment for the last time had more impact for me than the entire rory logan breakup that preceded it

4780328 because objective life does not produce satisfaction there is often the sense of two realities the objective world and the one behind the scenes objective reality does not hold the promise of fulfillment yet there are indications to fours that other realities of experience occasionally coexist with the objective world there is the sense of a plane of existence that is beyond ordinary reality that can be particularly sensed at the intense concordances of emotional life at those junctures where tragedy forces an upwelling of unconscious feeling or in affairs of the heart where love is lost or gained fours report that at such moments a connection can be sensed to that which is missing that they experience a felt connection to an eternal source of support

4780349 that was maybe the best performance ive ever seen out of my partner

4780354 this one was my game i carried my partner a little bit but he does the same for me all year long im not worried about it one bit hell get me back
4780355 hopefully neither of us will have to carry the other one well both be playing well
4780356 he is one of the best defensive players in the world
4780357 if they play like they did tonight they have a chance to beat anybody
4780358 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4780359 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4780360 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4780361 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4780362 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4780363 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart

4780394 the truth is that in this case russian aggression actually made some sense
4780395 our brides are not only seeking out photos that are creative artistic or fun
4780396 they have this stigma that is attached to their parents wedding photos the setting up of the shots the perfect dress and so forth they dream about how horrible it would be for that to happen to them so anything that jumps away from that makes life way happier for these brides theyre trying to escape that traditional world of the wedding photographer making sure your dress is perfectly clean or spaced out uniformly over the ground
4780397 everyone just looks around and says wow when they see the beautiful beaches crystal clear water and exotic ruins
4780398 brides started realizing hey this is liberation everyone has a sense of adventure so here comes an opportunity to book a session climbing around on pyramids or swimming in a cave and its available
4780399 ive seen some really bad tv interviews where they were treating this as a joke they make it look cheesy and artless
4780400 its brides being themselves expressing how crazy or free or how removed they are from their parents photographs
4780401 i love doing them because it gives you the freedom and the time to take amazing creative portraits at a location that cant happen on the wedding day
4780402 then youre running against the clock theres not much time to shoot the bride and after the ceremony you have to cover the reception with not much opportunity in between to think about going to another amazing place with ttd you have all of the time and freedom to do all kinds of different stuff its just a happy moment for the bride and groom and free rein for us to do whatever we want
4780403 its really difficult to define the levels what is really considered trash the dress how about sitting on horseback it that actually trash the dress yes it is because a bride would not ordinarily ever get on a horse we had a client who wanted to do a sailboat so we rented one and went out if they have something unique something theyve seen or have been inspired to do well do it
4780404 if youre in a city you could go in a fountain or perhaps shoot on a train track so you can go very dark or really artistic in any case the message being created using creative light should be about the love between the bride and groom and that this dress is that its not going to be worn again
4780405 you put a bride in a wedding dress in the middle of the ocean 100 feet deep and who knows what might happen so safety could be one of the limits but there are no rules for me i dont want there to be any limits or boundaries because thats the ultimate expression for this kind of session
4780406 we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history

4780454 mari sekarang kita tanyakan pada ali tentang suatu masalah saja bagaimana jawaban ali tentang masalah itu kita bisa menilai seberapa jauh kepandaiannya bagaimana apakah kalian setuju
4780455 dengan begitu kita dapat mencari kelemahan ali namun bila jawaban ali nanti selalu berbeda beda barulah kita percaya bahwa memang ali adalah orang yang cerdas
4780456 ilmu adalah warisan para nabi dan rasul sedangkan harta adalah warisan qarun firaun namrud dan lain lainnya
4780457 karena ilmu akan menjaga dirimu sementara harta malah sebaliknya engkau harus menjaganya
4780458 sebab orang yang mempunyai banyak harta akan mempunyai banyak musuh sedangkan orang yang kaya ilmu akan banyak orang yang menyayanginya dan hormat kepadanya
4780459 jelas jelas harta akan semakin berkurang namun bila ilmu yang engkau pergunakan maka akan semakin bertambah banyak
4780460 jika pemilik harta ada yang menyebutnya pelit sedangkan pemilik ilmu akan dihargai dan disegani
4780461 harta akan selalu dijaga dari kejahatan sedangkan ilmu tidak usah dijaga dari kejahatan lagi pula ilmu akan menjagamu
4780462 pemilik ilmu akan diberi syafaat oleh allah subhaanahu wa taala di hari kiamat nanti sementara pemilik harta akan dihisab oleh allah kelak
4780463 antara ilmu dan harta manakah yang lebih utama wahai ali
4780464 harta akan habis sedangkan ilmu malah sebaliknya ilmu akan abadi
4780465 akan dijunjung tinggi hanya karena hartanya sedangkan orang yang kaya ilmu dianggap intelektual
4780466 harta akan membuatmu tidak tenang dengan kata lain akan mengeraskan hatimu tetapi ilmu sebaliknya akan menyinari hatimu hingga hatimu akan menjadi terang dan tentram karenanya

4780470 barangsiapa yang bertobat sebelum matahari terbit dari barat niscaya allah akan mengampuninya
4780471 sesungguhnya allah azza wa jalla menerima tobat seorang hamba selama ruh belum sampai ketenggorokan
4780472 barangsiapa menempuh suatu jalan untuk menuntut ilmu niscaya allah memudahkan baginya dengan ilmu itu jalan menuju surga
4780473 inginkah kalian aku tunjukkan kepada amalan amalan yang terbaik tersuci disisi allah tertinggi dalam tingkatan derajat lebih utama daripada mendermakan emas dan perak dan lebih baik daripada menghadapi musuh lalu kalian tebas batang lehernya dan merekapun menebas batang leher kalian
4780474 setiap yang ma ruf adalah shadaqah dan orang yang menunjukkan jalan kepada kebaikan akan mendapat pahala seperti pelakunya

4780477 bacalah al qur an karena sesungguhnya ia akan datang pada hari kiamat untuk memberikan syafa at kepada pembacanya

4780479 kalian tidak akan masuk surga sehingga beriman dan tidaklah kalian beriman sempurna sehingga berkasih sayang maukah aku tunjukan suatu amalan yang jika kalian lakukan akan menumbuhkan kasih sayang di antara kalian yaitu sebarkanlah salam
4780480 sesungguhnya allah ta ala berfirman pada hari kiamat di manakah orang orang yang mencintai karena keagungan ku
4780481 tiada seorang muslim pun membesuk orang muslim yang sedang sakit pada pagi hari kecuali ada 70 000 malaikat bershalawat kepadanya hingga sore hari dan apabila ia menjenguk pada sore harinya mereka akan shalawat kepadanya hingga pagi hari dan akan diberikan kepadanya sebuah taman di surga
4780482 barangsiapa meringankan beban orang yang dalam kesulitan maka allah akan meringankan bebannya di dunia dan di akhirat
4780483 tidaklah seorang hamba menutup aib hamba yang lain di dunia kecuali allah akan menutupi aibnya di hari kiamat
4780484 rasulullah saw ditanya tentang apa yang paling banyak memasukkan manusia ke dalam surga maka beliau menjawab
4780485 hendaklah kalian berlaku jujur karena kejujuran itu menunjukan kepada kebaikan dan kebaikan menunjukan jalan menuju surga
4780486 barangsiapa menahan marah padahal ia mampu menampakkannya maka kelak pada hari kiamat allah akan memanggilnya di hadapan para makhluk dan menyuruhnya untuk memilih bidadari yang ia sukai
4780487 barangsiapa yang duduk dalam suatu majlis dan banyak terjadi di dalamnya kegaduhan lalu sebelum berdiri dari duduknya ia membaca do a maha suci engkau ya allah dan dengan memuji mu aku bersaksi bahwa tidak ada ilah tuhan yang berhak disembah kecuali engkau aku memohon ampun dan bertobat kepada mu melainkan ia akan diampuni dari dosa dosanya selama ia berada di majlis tersebut
4780488 tidaklah suatu musibah menimpa seorang muslim baik berupa malapetaka kegundahan rasa letih kesedihan rasa sakit kesusahan sampai sampai duri yang menusuknya kecuali allah akan melebur dengannya kesalahan kesalahannya

4780493 barangsiapa membangun masjid karena mengharapkan keridhaan allah maka dibangunkan baginya yang serupa di surga
4780494 seandainya saya tidak mempersulit umatku niscaya saya perintahkan mereka untuk bersiwak pada setiap shalat
4780495 barangsiapa berangkat ke masjid pada waktu pagi atau sore niscaya allah mempersiapkan baginya tempat persinggahan di surga setiap kali ia berangkat pada waktu pagi atau sore
4780496 tiada seorang muslim kedatangan waktu shalat fardhu kemudian ia memperbagus wudhu nya kekhusyu annya dan ruku nya kecuali hal itu menjadi pelebur dosa dosa yang dilakukan sebelumnya selama ia tidak dilanggar suatu dosa besar dan yang demikian itu berlaku sepanjang masa
4780497 barangsiapa shalat pada dua waktu pagi dan sore subuh dan ashar maka ia masuk surga
4780498 barangsiapa berwudhu lalu memperindahnya kemudian ia menghadiri shalat jum at mendengar dan menyimak khutbah maka diampuni dosanya yang terjadi antara jum at pada hari itu dengan jum at yang lain dan ditambah lagi tiga hari

4780503 setiap persendian dari salah seorang di antara kalian pada setiap paginya memiliki kewajiban sedekah sedangkan setiap tasbih itu sedekah setiap tahmid itu sedekah setiap tahlil itu sedekah setiap takbir itu sedekah memerintahkan kepada yang makruf itu sedekah dan mencegah dari yang mungkar itu sedekah tetapi semuanya itu dapat terpenuhi dengan melakukan shalat 2 rakaat dhuha
4780504 barangsiapa bershalawat kepadaku satu kali maka allah membalas shalawatnya itu sebanyak 10 kali
4780505 tiada seorang hamba berpuasa satu hari di jalan allah melainkan allah menjauhkannya karena puasa itu dari neraka selama 70 tahun
4780506 puasa 3 tiga hari pada setiap bulan merupakan puasa sepanjang masa
4780507 barangsiapa melakukan puasa ramadhan lalu ia mengiringinya dengan puasa 6 hari pada bulan syawal maka hal itu seperti puasa sepanjang masa
4780508 puasa pada hari arafat 9 dzulhijjah dapat melebur dosa dosa tahun yang lalu dan yang akan datang
4780509 dan dengan puasa hari asyura 10 muharram saya berharap kepada allah dapat melebur dosa dosa setahun sebelumnya
4780510 barangsiapa yang memberi hidangan berbuka bagi orang yang berpuasa maka baginya pahala seperti pahala orang berpuasa itu dengan tidak mengurangi pahalanya sedikitpun
4780511 barangsiapa mendirikan shalat di malam lailatul qadr karena iman dan mengharap pahala niscaya diampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lalu

4780574 all action potentials look the same in every neuron the spike is always 120 mv and it always occurs in an all or none fashion meaning that either a full spike is triggered or nothing there is no such thing as half a spike this is called the all or none principle an axon is like a gun it either fires or it doesnt thus because action potentials are always the same size a single action potential by itself cannot convey any unique information rather information is carried not by individual action potentials but by the firing rate of the neuron the number of action potentials per unit time
4780575 because action potentials are always the same size a single action potential by itself cannot convey any unique information

4780672 we win this game tonight because of our defense and the way yao played inside
4780673 its bigger than in 2004 because its really difficult having the home court and everything that comes with it
4780674 of course the pressure is always there in big games we feel the pressure but most of the time we handled it pretty well
4780675 i think this team comes with more experience after all of our training games and a very frustrating game against spain
4780676 i think we all learn how to trust each other play together and win this game as a team

4780692 there is a lot of christians buddhists also confucian so thats a mixed school
4780693 the truth is that we do not know for sure how many moves there were or where obama was living when he attended the government run public school unfortunately what obama writes about his time in indonesia is not precise enough with regard to locations and dates to help us to sort it out obama was young when he was in indonesia and maybe some of the details of the experience are obscure even to him or maybe he is trying to minimize intentionally the extent to which the experience placed him in an islamic setting where he received public school education in islam again we simply dont know

4780795 i had seen the pictures placed on e bay and then i went to see the property it was awful awful

4780798 they better disclose the fact that this was ordered to be shut down by the city of
4780799 im broke i cant pay my rent and im in a relationship with someone who could be a little more thoughtful and responsible
4780800 i have weird fetishes i like chicks who smoke while wearing high heels while they eat strawberry ice cream with some pizza cutters while sitting on the toilet im just sick
4780801 i hate my job this isnt what i told myself i wanted to be when i grew up im not a rock star a porn star a gynecologist or a lawyer im not even a doctor my job sucks

4780804 its a great honor for me that my teammates chose to vote for me im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
4780805 many team usa members have been under pressure to use their considerable platform to speak out against a narrow view of human rights in china and chinas involvement in sudan
4780806 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all of the stages that i have to become a u s citizen
4780807 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american
4780808 when we were in africa we didnt know what was there for us as kids we just ran god was planning all of this stuff for me and i didnt know now im using running to get the word out about how horrible things were back in sudan during the war
4780809 the prime ministers comments on price rise and inflation in his independence day address add salt to the wounds
4780810 the government can ill afford to seek solace in the relatively higher inflation figures of some other developing countries
4780811 the cpi m expresses grave concern over this high inflation and the utter failure of the upa united progressive alliance government to provide any relief compared to 2004 the retail price of wheat has gone up by over 60 that of rice and pulses by nearly 50 and edible oil by over 40 the higher procurement of wheat this year has had no impact on the wheat price in the open market
4780812 ive never seen mo throw a wild pitch in my life ive never seen it

4780814 we had opportunities early we had opportunities late because we dont execute we dont win at some point we have to start executing on a consistent basis if you want to play in october
4780815 you just cant get picked off in a situation like that
4780816 every game is important every game is a must win
4780817 you can take melkys name and change it with a lot of guys on this field right now
4780818 and they make a hell of a lot more money than melky cabrera theyre better than what theyve shown too
4780819 we have to find a way to get through this
4780820 ive never seen mo throw a wild pitch in my life ive never seen it
4780821 you have a chance to win a game tonight we have a ton of opportunities
4780822 we had opportunities early we had opportunities late because we dont execute we dont win at some point we have to start executing on a consistent basis if you want to play in october
4780823 you just cant get picked off in a situation like that
4780824 as the obama camp was quick to point out mccain opposed legislation that would have forced the u s government to buy american made motorcycles
4780825 but were making a play for them by saying that obamas economic policies are the true patriotic ones
4780826 all problems whatever they maybe can be solved through discussions

4780831 he wondered why other guys were getting opportunities and he wasnt
4780832 he was 19 years old and maturity takes time thats why they give a guy a five year scholarship
4780833 you can be sent home just as fast as they brought you in here
4780834 but i learned so much since that incident it was a tap on the hand and the coaches talk all the time about how much ive grown since then and ive changed im a whole different person now
4780835 he had to make a decision at that time and i never really thought he would make any other decision than the one he did but he did have to make a decision was he going to be a part and be a team member and in his behalf he did he realized he had made a mistake
4780836 hes the quickest guy ive seen after the snap in a long time around here
4780837 one of the toughest players i think ive ever played against
4780838 im just trying to do everything right so theres no reason i shouldnt play
4780839 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4780840 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4780841 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4780842 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4780843 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4780844 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4780845 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4780867 they have threatened to appeal against the order but so far no one has made contact with us on their behalf
4780868 today it is completely impossible to connect to pirate bay from italy

4780881 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4780882 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4780883 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4780884 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4780885 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4780886 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4780887 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4780888 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4780889 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4780890 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4780891 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4780892 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4780893 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4780894 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4780895 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4780896 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4780897 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4780898 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4780899 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4780900 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4780901 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4780902 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4780903 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4780904 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4780905 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4780906 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4780907 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4780908 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4780909 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4780910 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4780911 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4780912 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4780913 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4780914 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4780915 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4780916 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4780917 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4780918 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4780919 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4780920 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4780921 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4780922 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4780923 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4780924 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4780925 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4780926 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4780927 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4780928 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4780929 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4780930 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4780931 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4780932 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4780933 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4780934 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4780935 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4780936 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4780937 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4780938 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4780939 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4780940 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4780941 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4780942 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4780943 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4780944 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4780945 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4780946 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4780947 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4780948 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4780949 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4780950 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4780951 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4780952 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4780953 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4780954 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4780955 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4780956 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4780957 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4780958 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4780959 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4780960 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4780961 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4780962 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4780963 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4780964 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4780965 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4780966 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4780967 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4780968 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4780969 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4780970 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4780971 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4780972 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4780973 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4780974 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4780975 this is a planning took where all things are going
4780976 i was getting better and feeling more comfortable each round it just didnt come together
4780977 it was kind of devastating i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it
4780978 my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4780979 but at the same time i did my best and everyone knows i did
4780980 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
4780981 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation

4780987 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law

4780989 has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4780990 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4780991 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4780992 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4780993 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4780994 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4780995 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that

4781046 history will record that bill clinton left the economy in far better condition
4781047 turns out the worst economic situations in our countrys history have generally been the result of a huge tax increase on the top rate tax
4781048 in 2004 all of these industries donated more to president bush than they did to sen john kerry d ma yet by rejecting mccain wall street is showing its dissatisfaction with the past eight years of bushs presidency which saw skyrocketing deficits and financial crises perhaps they also want to make sure that benefits are dispersed throughout the economy rather than given to just the wealthiest americans

4781054 but i was thinking it would be a pretty gnarly comeback if we make the comeback
4781055 you dont expect to lead 6 0 and win easily against a team like this but they were not stopping to believe at 6 0 they were still comfortable im hoping they would get a little bit desperate but they continue playing like nothing happened

4781092 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4781093 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4781094 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4781095 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4781096 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
4781097 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4781098 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4781099 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4781100 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
4781101 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4781102 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4781103 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4781104 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4781105 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4781106 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4781107 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4781108 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4781109 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4781110 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view

4781114 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments

4781130 il macchinista e rappresentante sindacale per la sicurezza dante de angelis fonto ansa solo per aver dichiarato pubblicamente quello che tutti pensiamo e cio che lo spezzamento dei due eurostar a milano il 14 e 22 luglio scorsi stato un incidente potenzialmente molto pericoloso e un campanello dallarme che pone con forza allattenzione di tutti la questione della manutenzione della progettazione e dei controlli sugli etr

4781152 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4781153 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4781176 its a big day for china but we want to do more
4781177 we were playing at home and we just cannot lose this game
4781178 we win this game tonight because of our defense and the way yao played inside
4781179 its bigger than in 2004 because its really difficult having the home court and everything that comes with it
4781180 of course the pressure is always there in big games we feel the pressure but most of the time we handled it pretty well
4781181 i think this team comes with more experience after all of our training games and a very frustrating game against spain
4781182 i think we all learn how to trust each other play together and win this game as a team
4781183 sometimes it seems like we are down like at halftime and in the fourth quarter but we know what to do
4781184 this is a big something how do i describe i dont know give me a break

4781189 dont waste your time and ours by reinventing the wheel we told you what we wanted and we expect you to pay attention to what we said
4781190 working full time and trying to train was not fun or easy
4781191 there just wasnt enough time i really wanted to do well
4781192 i heard a lot of international athletes in the late 70s were getting scholarships from american colleges to come over and compete
4781193 somehow i got a phone call to red estes who was really interested and that really started the relationship it still took me almost a year to get over here because of the qualifications and paperwork it was definitely a process
4781194 when i first got off the plane in fresno and felt the heat i figured it was from the jet
4781195 but it was august so later it made sense but i just couldnt believe the heat i had never been in heat like it i got dropped off in the dorms and the air conditioning was great after a week i went home and i didnt think i could do it then i got thinking when i was home that i really should give it a try then i came back and that was it
4781196 balancing training for the olympics and school wasnt too difficult because i was towards the end of my academics so i knew what i needed to do to finish and graduate
4781197 it wasnt too bad schedule wise but i did have to compete here at the ncaa championships and win that in eugene ore i then had to fly home and compete almost immediately at our olympic trials
4781198 in england they take the athlete that wins the trials and then they hand pick two others to make the three person team
4781199 i placed second at the 1984 trials so they basically told me that i needed to compete over in great britain a couple of more times to show that i could throw the distances that i was throwing in the u s then i might get selected and sure enough i got selected the european season is after the american season so i always used to go over there anyways to compete in meets so it really wasnt anything new for me
4781200 we came over before the games and went to a training camp in san diego and spent a month there so people could acclimatize and get used to the time change while training in the u s
4781201 the french team was there training as well a lot of british people in track know the americans since they go to europe to compete so there is a lot of interactions and friendly bouts with the american teams then we moved up to the games themselves in the olympic village and it was at ucla the village is a microcosm of the world every nation is there this was my first olympics so the big thing for me was to just make the team and i didnt know what to expect when i got there it was completely different from what i expected you meet all of these people from other countries and you kind of discover that they all did the exact same thing as you to try to get to the games they have the same kind of habits as far as training some go to school some work and train so it was good to know that there are all of these different countries but all of the athletes do the same thing
4781202 i went through to the next round but then i hit three fouls in the final
4781203 i just didnt do well so that was it my time was done there i stayed and helped support the other folks because a lot of the people especially in the throws i have known since i was like 14 so we are all kind of friends helping each other out
4781204 i mean i was still young enough strong enough and fast enough so i thought well i will carry on
4781205 it was a big decision though whether to keep competing or not because you are pretty much in poverty when you are training because you dont work a lot of hours and not going to school anymore its also tough to go work out almost every day like you need too
4781206 i made the 1988 team the exact same way i did in 1984
4781207 i had to prove myself again it puts a lot of pressure on you because they have to select you its not the case of you do this and then you are on the team if you prove yourself that you can throw that well then we can decide to select you for the team it was a just a lot of waiting then the way i found out was in the newspaper thats the way they announce it someone actually called me at 4 a m and said that i got picked because my name was in the paper so thats how i found out
4781208 you just cant be injured and try to throw competitively
4781209 so i was pretty much out and that was it but thats the way things go sometimes i tried to look at it philosophically as well it was a great journey and i got there and it was a great experience just to be there and that is probably more important than just competing well i went to all of the events weightlifting swimming and all of the track and field it was just incredible in those games with flo jo and carl lewis the athletes seats were right there along the front of the track so it was good
4781210 competing at fresno state was good because they had a great track schedule as far as competing against teams like san jose state and the teams with good throwers
4781211 i have some friends from the great britain team who are retired like me but we are already planning a reunion they are making preparations now for those games my mom is actually here visiting now and talking about everything they are building now for the games in four years it will be great for london to host the games and hopefully help bring track and field alive once again
4781212 its so befitting of michael to do it like that i won a race by a hundredth of a second like he did and im not giving my medal back
4781213 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4781214 this thing michael did is probably going to spur a lot more life into me
4781215 i was going to be trite and say to him and ask him this question what was the most difficult race and when did you know you had a chance to win seven gold medals
4781216 i dont have to it was tonight and it was epic
4781217 i think hes got a real future in our business

4781394 aside from the avoidable loss of innocent life one the most depressing things about the past few days is the lack of intellectual honesty on display rather than examine motive and facts on the ground both russians and georgians have chosen to extract what they wish from the overall picture and used it to fit their pre existing nationalist ideologies
4781395 how do we cope with the complexity of the modern world and foster local and global solidarity in the face of diversity and individualism solutions to these challenges will come from our growing desire to shape our neurological processes

4781424 mainsoft made the process of running gaia applications on java ee incredibly easy
4781425 the alternative manually porting a library that took us ten man years to develop and maintaining two separate code bases would have cost us millions of dollars thanks to mainsoft our users have the freedom to run the gaia application on their preferred deployment platform
4781426 the development experience was highly intuitive our c developers were developing java portlets after one day of a two day training session with mainsoft consultants
4781427 using mainsoft we developed the application just as we would develop a typical iis application we didnt even consider the application was running on unix
4781428 the application meets our customers performance and business requirements and it costs one third less than what it would have cost had we attempted to learn eclipse and write the application in java
4781429 we had to make very few changes to our core client library all fairly minor to complete the c to java conversion the process took about three weeks to complete

4781463 spain traditionally fights very hard really once they get on a roll they ride that emotion and they did that throughout the first half i thought we regrouped at halftime and came back in the second half and really talked about defensive adjustments and getting back to what were good at which is team defense and we did a much better job in the second half
4781464 at the end of the first quarter as well as the beginning of the second quarter we had a lull where we werent matching the intensity of spain
4781465 theyre a team that plays on a lot of emotion and they were high emotionally we dont ever want to get into a position where were letting a team ride an emotional high like that and being so comfortable in their sets in the second half we talked about it we didnt want them to come out as comfortable as they were at the end of the first quarter and in the second quarter because it would have been a long game for us
4781466 we feel that if we get after it defensively its going to translate into offense

4781505 theres a direct correlation between congestion and flow factors and accidents
4781506 the biggest problems are where backups occur cameras destroy the flow of the road any time a driver hits the brake and the one after him you completely destroy the flow and capacity of the road

4781508 none of it has anything to do with bottom line is its all about money
4781509 will remove from vc 21455 5 the requirement that an automated enforcement device be at an intersection and that will allow the devices to be put on freeways that change is accomplished by the repositioning of a 7 word phrase in vc 21455 5 a 2
4781510 in the u s the assumption is that people dont like speed cameras but we found in our surveys that in d c 51 percent of drivers favored speed cameras and 36 percent apposed them

4781513 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein thou has done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars
4781514 thus saith the lord of hosts drink ye and be drunken and spew and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send
4781515 should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the lord of hosts
4781516 drink ye and be drunken and spew and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you
4781517 thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday
4781518 behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to him the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the lord hath spoken this word the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and fadeth away the haughty people of the earth do languish the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the everlasting covenant therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left
4781519 a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as the garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness yea and nothing shall escape them
4781520 a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the lord thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the ground
4781521 blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand

4781526 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4781527 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4781528 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4781529 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4781530 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4781532 i see india winning 10 medals at the next olympic meet
4781533 indian coaches are equally capable but the problem is we dont train them in technical and other stuff
4781534 cricket is huge in this country i love cricket and though cricket is the most popular game that will not help recognise india as a sporting power
4781535 though there is no such thing at the moment i will like to certainly contribute in some way and in course of time i will think about it
4781536 i always keep myself detached from winning i just try to keep my cool and focus on my performance rather than winning

4781549 what is ur prediction for jtyjn final figures given that it is dropping heavily now in its 4th and 5th
4781550 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
4781551 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
4781552 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that
4781553 i had very much a working holiday i spent some time in woking with my engineers preparing for this weekend and i also spent some time back in finland at my home town of suomussalmi where i help organise an annual karting event in the town
4781554 obviously having just won the most recent grand prix made it a fantastic event for everybody
4781555 it was my first time back in finland for quite a long time too so it was great to turn up as a grand prix winner
4781556 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
4781557 there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff
4781558 its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
4781559 dammi la lista di tutti i file che iniziano con pippo pippo e dammi i particolari opzione l
4781560 these feelings are stupid i shouldnt be feeling like this
4781561 this is where the heavy questioning comes in we have to find out where that girl is
4781562 if the two clubs had come to an agreement i would have left
4781563 you have to take into account that people are offering me three million euros a year its unbelievable it made me think for a few days
4781564 st etienne quickly replied that i was not transferable not transferable that makes me laugh because when st etienne bought me from bordeaux i was also not transferable at that time
4781565 last year we had bad luck against roma being without robinho ramos robben its the coach who has to take the decisions for me we are fine
4781566 subconsciously after six years without winning the champions league you are anxious to win in europe again but you need to stop and think for a second and see that we have won two leagues after going four years without a title
4781567 everybody aspires for more but we need to take it step by step if this year we are only able to win the copa del rey that would also be important
4781568 the reality is that of the four titles that we play for this season as a minimum we need to win one
4781569 its an odd tournament if you win then it doesnt really matter and if you lose you are criticised but if i had to lose the supercopa to win the league then i would settle for that right now
4781570 i dont know if he wants to go or not he has not said anything to me
4781571 as long as the contract isnt signed i dont want to confirm anything
4781572 look at marko basa one day he is going to sign for paris st germain with whom he and us came to an agreement the next day he is going to celtic the next to genoa the next to lokomotiv moscow
4781573 bastian is not fully fit and after an hour he was having a few difficulties
4781574 i wanted some fresh legs and knew andreas ottl would be able to get a few more touches of the ball in midfield
4781575 we have all our players at different stages of fitness and bastian started training particularly late and has even been ill so has borowski who was injured and luca toni and martin demichelis have been out longer
4781576 miro has played all of euro 2008 and simply is not at the level that we want him to be at
4781577 this is only the first bundesliga game and he is probably only halfway ready but it is normal at the start that we are not working harmoniously
4781578 this is an improvement on the dfb pokal first round game against erfurt so we are happy with that
4781579 were catching up but we are still going to be below normal
4781580 we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves
4781581 there are a lot of positives to take from the game we dont go away hammered and we go away believing we can compete in this league
4781582 these only show where a source is not how good it is
4781583 phil booth national coordinator of the no2id campaign said the report confirmed millions would suffer inconvenience distress and worse under the id regime he said suggestions manual checks will suffice every time the computer says no begs the question what is the point of the system in the first place he said the problems raised about the biometrics were fundamental and meant that compulsory fingerprinting would embed discrimination at the heart of the id card scheme higher failure rates for the old ethnic minorities the disabled and the infirm risk creating a biometric underclass he warned
4781584 more than 10 young israelis were detained at the ayia napa resort in cyprus in recent days on charges of drunk driving and unruly behavior at clubs and hotels several other israeli youngsters were held at the larnaca international airport after misbehaving and being rude to local police some of the israelis were sent back to israel
4781585 according to a new report released this week in mexico city by the population border and migrant affairs commission for every three adults deported from the united states there is one child abandoned and left behind but what is even more shocking and deserves further scrutiny from congress and the american people is the documentation in the report that cites how in the first 7 months of the year the united states has deported 90 000 children to mexico children without their parents and who are alone
4781586 to reach something good it is very useful to have gone astray and thus acquire experience
4781587 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government

4781589 frantic campaign has targeted many charities and service organizations by storming closing and confiscating the belongings of these organizations
4781590 without any legal justification just under the claim that they were closeto hamas in many cases the campaign targeted private businesses under a shameless accusation that the owners receive money from hamas
4781591 inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers
4781592 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4781593 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4781594 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use
4781595 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4781596 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4781597 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4781598 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4781599 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4781600 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4781601 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4781602 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4781603 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4781604 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4781605 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4781606 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4781607 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4781608 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4781609 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4781610 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4781611 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4781612 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4781613 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4781614 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4781615 how the lord of the rings became a hollywood blockbuster and put new zealand on the map
4781616 your skin is something that i stir into my tea
4781617 i think the government and the health authorities are going to have a very difficult task in changing the culture that exists at the moment where young people go out and get totally drunk
4781618 now they have a longer period in which to do that and our policing of the night time economy has had to expand as a result
4781619 there has been a lot of hard work by our officers and area policing teams linked in closely with work done by district councils and the licensing trade which has been successful in tackling alcohol related crime
4781620 our message is clear go out have a good time and enjoy yourself safely however if you are intent on causing trouble be sure that you will be penalised with at least a fine and possibly a custodial sentence
4781621 not only do we crack down firmly on those who get drunk and cause misery to others but we will also deal firmly with licensees and traders who sell alcohol to under 18s or those who are already drunk
4781622 tim you should call in sick tomorrow and come tubing with me
4781623 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us
4781624 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down for another night out there so we got prepared to stick through another tough night
4781625 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm
4781626 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking oh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried
4781627 and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break
4781628 it was amazing yesterday morning to again hear the sound of a helicopter we heard it fly over the back of the ridge
4781629 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again
4781630 we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up
4781631 finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility when it did finally see us everyone was just jumping up and down cheering
4781632 they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4781633 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner of nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4781634 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4781635 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want we are not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4781636 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4781637 the deployment of the new missile defense forces in europe is aimed at russia so fairy tales about deterring some rogue states with the help of these facilities do not work
4781638 i have great gear so why am i still unhappy with my shots
4781639 this macro reverse lens setup has given me a new lease of life i had been a bit down in the dumps in my attitude to photography looking at all the fantastic offerings from all members and thinking theres no point in submitting any of mine up against you lot but now im getting really enthusiastic again with these macro shots
4781640 the principles set out below are supported by the presidents of russia and france and the presidents of russia and france call on the parties to sign this document
4781641 we have recovered four bodies this morning from one spot and two more from another these were civilians who were killed yesterday friday afternoon by the ethiopian troops
4781642 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4781643 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4781644 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4781645 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4781646 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4781647 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4781648 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take

4781673 we made so many baserunning mistakes today and we made errors
4781674 we had bats that werent quality at bats and it was kind of disappointing after what we had done against b c and after what we had done against ontario the first time we played them
4781675 looking in the other dugout if we had gotten up three or four runs we might have ran away with it
4781676 we got up run and we had opportunities to score runs and we probably had more baserunners than they did in the first few innings but we just couldnt get them in
4781677 it was a day of mental and physical mistakes with the pool were in that just cant happen
4781678 we have a chance though we live to play another day
4781679 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4781680 multitudes had heard his christs words and believed them but they did not have the moral courage to acknowledge him as their saviour lest they should be turned out of the synagogue
4781681 the sanhedrin had rejected christs message and was bent upon his death therefore jesus departed from jerusalem from the priests the temple the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and turned to another class to proclaim his message and to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations as the light and life of men was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation again and again the history of christs withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers preached the word of god they had no thought of separating themselves from the established church but the religious leaders would not tolerate the light and those that bore it were forced to seek another class who were longing for the truth in our day few of the professed followers of the reformers are actuated by their spirit few are listening for the voice of god and ready to accept truth in whatever guise it may be presented often those who follow in the steps of the reformers are forced to turn away from the churches they love in order to declare the plain teaching of the word of god and many times those who are seeking for light are by the same teaching obliged to leave the church of their fathers that they may render obedience
4781682 the recreant priests added licentiousness to the dark catalogue of their crimes yet they still polluted by their presence the tabernacle of the lord and laden with sin dared to come into the presence of a holy god as the men of israel witnessed the corrupt course of the priests they thought it safer for their families not to come up to the appointed place of worship many went from shiloh with their peace disturbed their indignation aroused until they at last determined to offer their sacrifices themselves concluding that this would be fully as acceptable to god as to sanction in any manner the abominations practiced in the sanctuary

4781684 the enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation was to take place among seventh day adventists and that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith and engaging in a process of reorganization
4781685 the things you have described as taking place in indiana the lord has shown me would take place just before the close of probation every uncouth thing will be demonstrated there will be shouting with drums music and dancing the senses of rational beings will become so confused that they cannot be trusted to make right decisions and this is called the moving of the holy spirit the holy spirit never reveals itself in such methods in such a bedlam of noise this is an invention of satan to cover up his ingenious methods for making of none effect the pure sincere elevating ennobling sanctifying truth for this time better never have the worship of god blended with music than to use musical instruments to do the work which last january was represented to me would be brought into our camp meetings the truth for this time needs nothing of this kind in its work of converting souls a bedlam of noise shocks the senses and pervert that which if conducted aright might be a blessing the powers of satanic agencies blend with the din and noise to have a carnival and this is termed the holy spirits working
4781686 i saw the nominal church and nominal adventists like judas would betray us to the catholics to obtain their influence to come against the truth the saints then will be an obscure hidden people little known to the catholics but the churches and nominal adventists who know of our faith and customs for they hate us on account of the sabbath for they could not refute it will betray the saints and report them to the catholics as those who disregard the institutions of the people that is that they keep the sabbath and disregard sunday then the catholics bid the protestants to go forward and issue a decree that all who will not observe the first day of the week instead of the seventh day shall be slain and the catholics whose numbers are large will stand by the protestants the catholics will give their power to the image of the beast and the protestants will work as their mother worked before them to destroy the saints but before their decree bring or bear fruit the saints will be delivered by the voice of god then i saw that jesus work in the sanctuary will soon be finished and after his work there is finished he will come to the door of the first apartment and confess the sins of israel upon the head of the scape goat then he will put on the garments of vengeance then the plagues will come upon the wicked and they do not come till jesus puts on that garment and takes hs place upon the great white cloud then while the plagues are falling the scape goat is being led away he makes a mighty struggle to escape but he is held fast by the hand that leads him if he should effect his escape israel would lose their lives i saw that it would take time to lead away the scape goat into the land of forgetfulness after the sins were put on his head the great white cloud i saw was not the holy place but entirely separate from the holy and most holy place entirely separate from the sanctuary then the angel repeated these words and said this is the time spoken of in isaiah he saw that there was not man and wondered that there was no intercessor he had no mediator between god and man and these plagues could be withheld no longer for jesus had ceased to plead for israel and they were covered with the covering of the almighty god and they could live in the sight of a holy god and those who were not covered the plagues fell upon them for they had nothing to shelter or protect them from the wrath of god
4781687 the disciples were the channel of communication between christ and the people this should be a real encouragement to his disciples today christ is the great center the source of all strength his disciples are to receive their supplies from him the most intelligent the most spiritually minded can bestow only as they receive of themselves they can supply nothing for the needs of the soul we can impart only that which we receive from christ and we can receive only as we impart to others as we continue imparting we continue to receive and the more we impart the more we shall receive thus we may be constantly believing trusting receiving and imparting
4781688 the lord commanded one of his ancient servants pray not thou for this people jer 7 16 and 11 14 neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee the prophet thus describes the sins which had called forth this fearful denunciation the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace the apostles declare that this state of things will find its counterpart in the last days many have a form of godliness but in their daily life deny the power thereof they have ceased to be convicted of their sins or alarmed at their state they say in their hearts the church is flourishing peace and spiritual prosperity are within her borders the words of the prophet may well apply to these self deceivers they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them
4781689 in the time of the saviour the jews had so covered over the precious jewels of truth with the rubbish of tradition and fable that it was impossible to distinguish the true from the false the saviour came to clear away the rubbish of superstition and long cherished errors and to set the jewels of gods word in the framework of truth what would the saviour do if he should come to us now as he did to the jews he would have to do a similar work in clearing away the rubbish of tradition and ceremony the jews were greatly disturbed when he did this work as are sdas today they had lost sight of the original truth of god but christ brought it again to view it is our work to free the precious truths of god from superstition and error
4781690 i have been shown that the spirit of the world is fast leavening the church you are following the same path as did ancient israel there is the same falling away from your holy calling as gods peculiar people you are having fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness your ecumenical concord with unbelievers have provoked he lords displeasure you know not the things that belong to your peace and they are fast being hid from your eyes the very words applied to fallen israel on page 17 of the great controversy your neglect to follow the light will place you in a more unfavorable position than the jews upon whom christ pronounced a woe
4781691 like ancient israel the church has dishonored her god by departing from the light neglecting her duties and abusing her high and exalted privilege of being peculiar and holy in character her members have violated their covenant to live for god and him only they have joined with the selfish and world loving pride the love of pleasure and sin have been cherished and christ has departed his spirit has been quenched in the church satan works wide by side with professed christians yet they are so destitute of spiritual discernment that they do not detect him
4781692 among the professed followers of christ there is the same pride formalism vainglory selfishness and oppression that existed in the jewish nation
4781693 gods professed people are selfish and self caring they are idolaters and are worse in the sight of god than the heathen graven image worshppers who have had no knowledge of a better way
4781694 if the church of god becomes lukewarm laodicean it does not stand in favor with god any more than do the churches that are represented as having fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird those who have had opportunities to hear and receive the truth and who have united with the seventh day adventist church calling themselves the commandment keeping people of god and yet possess no more vitality and consecration to god than do the nominal churches will receive of the plagues of god just as verily as the churches who oppose the law of god
4781695 we must as a people arouse and cleanse the camp of israel
4781696 now it is just exactly as in the days of the jews when a message came in why all the power of the leaders such some leaders on this forum was put against it that it should not have access to the people now brethren go to god for yourselves and on your knees plead with god if god sends us light let it come to us and let no man close the door or try to close it dont close it yourselves open the door of your heart and let the brilliant rays of light shine into your heart and into your mind i pray you let the sun of righteousness in

4781699 un mont n de personas tiene ideas sobre c mo monetizar esto y nosotros tambi n
4781700 i would say we felt as though we should have taken all three points particularly with the chances we had in the first half and even in the second half we had chances
4781701 but to come here to sydney and say were really disappointed about not taking all three points speaks volumes about how we played
4781702 i felt we dominated at the back we were really good defensively had a lot of possession in the middle and created probably four gilt edged chances but didnt put them away
4781703 clint bolton was exceptional in goal but thats what keepers are there for
4781704 he did a great job for us and the second half i thought we more than took the game to melbourne and maybe could have come out of it with something
4781705 for coaches like them to talk about it like that is a disgrace to them as people
4781706 our club has never been a willing participant in anything like that
4781707 it was well below what we expect even for a side as young as that it wasnt acceptable
4781708 it was important for our members and supporters who have been coming here week after week in what has been a tough season we are able to repay them today to some degree
4781709 the opposition cant give you the impetus to play well the next week
4781710 cale has been consistent the whole year cale has been very very good the whole year
4781711 we havent resolved it yet we havent signed off on it from the bulldogs end
4781712 were very close and were hoping to have it wrapped up over the weekend
4781713 i think its fair enough that were wary with the negotiations given were dealing with both sonny and his manager and on previous history weve got to make sure we dot all the is and cross all the ts here
4781714 we didnt want sonny bill to leave the club in the first place but theyre the cards weve been dealt with and weve got to do the best we can and get on with it
4781715 una dolencia que afecta cada vez a un mayor n mero de personas y que se caracteriza por la falta de adaptaci n de los afectados a la actividad laboral al t rmino del periodo de descanso estival
4781716 pretende ayudar a las personas a superar los efectos que produce la vuelta al trabajo tras las vacaciones
4781717 queremos ofrecer una serie de recomendaciones para facilitar en lo posible una mejor adaptaci n de las personas en sus primeros d as de trabajo dado que mucha gente pasa por este periodo con dificultades sin saber que es un estado de nimo descrito y diagnosticado y que se puede afrontar con numerosos recursos
4781718 too bad well never know if this is a face you could learn to love
4781719 im really happy for the players it was obviously a very difficult week for them and just as importantly im really happy for our fans
4781720 myself and the players get to come and work on what didnt go right last weekend
4781721 the fans were sort of a little bit powerless in that position so it would have been a tough week for them
4781722 im really pleased and obviously thankful for the people that did turn up tonight
4781723 there was no pre indicator at all as to what happened
4781724 i think we did a fair job of moving on pretty quickly but you cant say that you havent been conscious of it most minutes of most days
4781725 you could probably just cut and paste the last four weeks
4781726 except tonight i thought we got a couple of dud decisions as well
4781727 at 11 30pm that night after all the photos and interviews and ceremonies and congratulations were over vladimir salnikov walked into the cafeteria at the athletes village hoping to grab a late snack there were about 250 or 300 athletes and coaches in the room representing a wide variety of nations and sports as word spread that salnikov had entered the athletes and coaches spontaneously stopped eating rose and gave him a standing ovation
4781728 her legs are epic long and stretching out from here to forever
4781729 our thanks to taylor momsen and ali lohan for making 14 the new 35
4781730 its funny because i forget that i look the same you know that i look the same all the time
4781731 i have two different modes i have my on set mode and then i have my mode with my friends and family my taylor mode and when im in my taylor mode i forget that people still see me as jenny it takes a minute
4781732 with jenny theres that sense of a very intelligent observant young girl looking around and going you know im not as rich as these girls and i dont have that leg up because of my family but im just as pretty and i think that im smarter
4781733 so if i play my cards right i can win this game
4781734 we wanted a character that in this journey of trying to fit in at school might actually succeed in her goal and even triumph over the other girls at some point
4781735 jenny has put high school to the side and focuses on her career trying to be a fashion designer and to fulfill her goals of world domination
4781736 they take up most of my body and im not used to coordinating them
4781737 i had the opportunity to say no but i love it ive grown up in it its kind of all i know
4781738 she really had that great quality on the one hand being cindy lou who really sweet and just sort of delightful and smiley and funny and she can act her age but she also has that gus van sant side to her very grown up very self aware
4781739 there is an intelligent watchful darkness that shes got as well those two qualities flickering back and forth between the sweet and the innocent and the more intelligent observer felt like that was really something that could be something magical for the role
4781740 we showed some footage we just got out enthused it was a fraction of a second or one or two steps
4781741 they new zealand were just a little bit more desperate
4781742 the talk is always about being physical but not so much about the action its just a mindset its an attitude and a bit of technique that we need to work on
4781743 i just pointed out that our attitude and being technically very good at the breakdown will get us through there and being physical is just a by product of that
4781744 it was just a matter of showing them a few clips here and there and making sure the guys understood where they needed to improve and what they needed to do
4781745 things like working hard off the ball and trying to be balanced going into the breakdown and keeping our head up and making sure we maintain or take that space
4781746 they south africa are probably technically not the same as new zealand going into the breakdown but they use a lot of power
4781747 weve got to make sure that we are there in numbers and working as hard as we can to make sure we secure the ball or try and turn it over like we did against them in perth
4781748 we were very good at getting numbers there and competing consistently and we turned over a few balls
4781749 losing matthew didnt help to win by 39 points is a good result
4781750 in the last quarter i think we probably put our cues in the rack a little bit and didnt really play the best footy but it really didnt matter
4781751 they are the benchmark no question theres no question they are a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin
4781752 you jewish slut i love you and thats why i beat you
4781753 you dont love me if you loved me then you would not ever beat me up
4781754 you beat her up didnt you what the type of a fucking person are you omfg our friend best friend actually beats his beautiful but helpless girlfriend that is laerke omfg
4781755 we just cant keep our young people on the park this year
4781756 its frustrating and some of them are some soft tissue stuff but some others are innocuous clashes or shoulders or knees or the odd stress fracture were just going through a bit of a run
4781757 in one aspect we are 12 months behind with them
4781758 in another aspect young players if you play a lot when youre 18 19 20 there might be some fatigue factor there
4781759 the positive im looking at is that our 18 19 year olds some of them havent played a lot of footy but that might hold them in good stead long term
4781760 thats me trying to take a positive out of it
4781761 he knows as well as i know that hes got to continue to lift his intensity to be a quality ruckman in this league
4781762 ive only been a phone sex operator for a few months now to help with extra income im a single mother of two young boys so money is very important to me im in a loving relationship with a wonderful man who loves my kids and treats me very well he understands that im only doing this part time to help save for my childrens college fund
4781763 the good thing is that you dont have to dress up for it
4781764 the war began as an ill considered move by georgia to retake south ossetia by force
4781765 saakashvilis larger goal was to lead his country into war as a form of calculated self sacrifice hoping that russias predictable overreaction would convince the west of exactly the narrative that many commentators have now taken up
4781766 russia seeks to frustrate americas use of georgia for this purpose and uses abkhazia and south ossetia as daggers pointed at the jugular of the btc pipeline
4781767 when saakashvili sought to drive the russians out of these enclaves the russians struck back
4781768 bochornosas y no representan un exabrupto sino la l nea que tiene el gobierno del presidente ortega porque en ocasiones ya ha llamado moscas e intervencionistas

4781783 a quienes el gobierno de la rep blica trata con indiferencia y desd n
4781784 no se hacen grandes revelaciones ni mucho menos sino que est d ndole lectura a una voz popular es decir est hablando lo que se comenta en el pueblo elev ndolo a un canal persuasivo e incidente como lo es instituci n religiosa
4781785 en vez de descalificar de forma inapropiada escuche razone pondere y utilice esas facultades que dios nos dio para contemplar y admitir la posibilidad de estar actuando de forma equivocada
4781786 aqu no se trata de la novedad de los temas es por la boca de donde sale este mensaje que tal vez se logra que el gobierno le ponga atenci n
4781787 muy por el contrario es por expresar aquello que es profundamente compartido
4781788 existe un claro temor de la gente sobre la legitimidad de las pr ximas elecciones municipales a eso se suman las descalificaciones por parte del gobierno de personas que est n participando en pol tica de cara a los comicios de noviembre
4781789 es como una ventana en un cuarto oscuro que al entrar la luz significa una bocanada de aire para cambiar las cosas en nicaragua
4781790 es el mismo llamado de atenci n que se ha hecho desde diferentes sectores y por eso todos estamos llamados a poner atenci n a la carta de los obispos
4781791 yo no tengo nada qu ver nada con esa carta
4781792 la forma de actuar del presidente ortega su forma irrespetuosa y chabacana de dirigirse a las mujeres tanto nacionales como extranjeras la suspensi n y sanci n para el aborto terap utico la persecuci n que el gobierno tiene contra mujeres dirigentes han tenido eco en la comunidad internacional no han sido de balde sus ataques
4781793 todas las mujeres organizadas en el mundo estamos enlazadas somos solidarias y conocemos que hay toda una campa a para protestar contra el presidente ortega a los pa ses adonde llegue seguro en algunos pa ses las protestas ser n mayores que en otros pero las protestas continuar n
4781794 esto podr a ser el inicio de una bola de nieve mundial de las mujeres en contra del presidente ortega sobre todo por el lugar desde el cual salt la liebre paraguay que es una de las sociedades m s tradicionales de am rica latina

4781797 diez a os despu s de que su demanda estuvo en los tribunales de justicia de nicaragua aparecer ante la opini n p blica contribuye a que el olvido no obstaculice mi b squeda de justicia tambi n implica volver a exponerme emocionalmente a los dif ciles episodios del pasado
4781798 en ese expediente pueden encontrar mis cartas de actualizaci n del caso y tambi n las tres ltimas solicitudes de audiencia que me han denegado lamento mencionar que ha sido la falta de tr mite de la cidh lo que ha estancado mi caso en las instancias internacionales como sobreviviente y de acuerdo con mis modestos recursos y posibilidades sin apoyo institucional de nadie he mantenido la tramitaci n de mi caso
4781799 desde enero de 2006 he mencionado a la cidh que la ausencia de pronunciamiento de su parte me expone a la total indefensi n en el dif cil momento que vive actualmente nicaragua

4781872 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4781873 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4781874 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4781875 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4781876 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4781877 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4781878 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4781879 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4781880 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4781881 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4781882 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4781883 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4781884 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4781885 its right up there with worst ideas in the history of modern education
4781886 we could end up arming half the gangs in houston
4781887 it is foolish to introduce more weapons into the school environment even under the guise of wanting to provide better protection for our students
4781888 staff would have to be constantly concerned with weapon security and retention thus taking away from their ability to focus on their main goal teaching students in the event of a crisis there is no manageable way to integrate armed staff into the crisis response plan
4781889 they sound a little bit more paranoid than they need to be
4781890 but if theyre looking for notoriety they certainly stirred it up
4781891 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4781892 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4781893 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4781894 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing

4781898 it was then that i knew the whole thing was a hoax
4781899 thats the secret of bigfoot i know because ive fought with it i tore its f cking arm off
4781900 i had an eyeball arm and leg replaced with robotic parts so i could get the steve austin role
4781901 thats all the faster i could move because my brain never adapted very well to the replacement parts so the shows producers decided to add in some robotic sound effects while i struggled to move during action scenes
4781902 my bionic parts could be controlled remotely by a special transmitter the crew had in their possession
4781903 sometimes they would make my arm punch my face and then they all would roll on the floor laughing it used to piss me off but i can see now how it might be funny
4781904 whenever we do try we just end up fighting because we are too honest with each other if you are co writing with someone you dont know so well you are a bit more polite you can imagine the conversations that came up i dont think we even tried to write together for this album it worked with me going to my room and soph going to hers

4781948 do you support keeping drug possession dealing and trafficking a crime
4781949 it appalls me at the thought that people would be na ve enough to vote for someone who admits drug use
4781950 watching parents wail and cry and talk about the hell their families went through
4781951 i would never vote for an elected official who was ever a drug user
4781952 we have to get this country back to being an honorable nation with honorable people running it
4781953 we worked long and hard to close those drug paraphernalia shops in the 1980s and long and hard again to get student drug testing in the schools so we could get drugs out of the schools

4781967 there is no better more qualified spokesperson for the democratic partys failed energy policies than speaker nancy pelosi
4781968 in short speaker pelosis new energy plan is a recipe for more of the same high energy prices and a dangerous dependence on foreign oil
4781969 there is no better more qualified spokesperson for the democratic partys failed energy policies than speaker nancy pelosi
4781970 months of pursuing false solutions to this crisis has left speaker pelosi on the wrong side of the american people and a fair amount of her fellow democrats
4781971 in short speaker pelosis new energy plan is a recipe for more of the same high energy prices and a dangerous dependence on foreign oil
4781972 while speaker pelosi continues to hide behind the microphone house republicans have been taking our vision for americas energy independence directly to the american people
4781973 over the last two weeks house republicans have embarked on a historic nationwide protest to demand speaker pelosi back up her words with action
4781974 that protest will recommence on monday and until the american people get that vote it will continue if speaker pelosi is serious about getting to work on a bipartisan energy plan she will join us

4782004 the ohio revised code is very clear on this issue
4782005 you must be a qualified elector for a period of 30 days before engaging in the voting process ohio has never been a same day registration state and the law requires a waiting period to allow for adequate verification of a voters registration the legislature did not create this problem jennifer brunner created it by issuing a directive that defies a law thats been on the books for years
4782006 democrats want to make this an argument over disenfranchisement but thats a tired line that has absolutely no merit
4782007 this is about rejecting a very dangerous precedent created by allowing same day registration its about protecting the safeguards built into our election system to ensure voter confidence its about defending the intent of the law and its about exposing a troubling partisan agenda aimed at creating an illegal loophole that defies the will of the people
4782008 we will defend every qualified voters right to cast a ballot but we will not stand by and allow democrats to create illegal loopholes that allow the system to be exploited
4782009 we are asking the secretary of state to revoke her previous directive and issue a clear and uniform statewide standard prohibiting same day registration she indicated in news reports today that she intends to provide further clarification on this issue i am asking her to reconsider the law which is very clear on this requirement

4782019 its organised crime presence is most apparent in the betting ring where the laundering of the proceeds of crime had been commonplace lewis said
4782020 tax avoidance bank by criminals nsw racing is not immune to these questionable money laundering practices either
4782021 no one can give any guarantees that money laundering is not taking place on sydney and nsw racetracks racing nsw chief executive peter vlandys said yesterday
4782022 but we will soon have mechanisms in place that would make it very hard for anyone to do so and get away with it
4782023 if there is any suspicious activity we will have the power to study the betting records of wagering operators and also to look at a punters bona fides vlandys said
4782024 if wagering operators dont give us access to this betting information then we have the power to withdraw their licence to operate on nsw racing and they could face criminal prosecution under the race fields legislation if they continue to bet on nsw racing
4782025 in the debate about the race fields legislation the point that has been lost is that this legislation is not just about collecting fees from wagering operators this legislation is also extremely important to protect the integrity of racing

4782027 six clubs were keen on jordan but to the boys credit he didnt want to go to sydney he wanted to finish school on the gold coast and he wanted to represent the titans
4782028 to be honest he could have earned substantially more by going to sydney before he even played first grade but life isnt all about money
4782029 the new deal for jordan was in the mix for months we werent going to play him in first grade before we signed him to an extended deal he said
4782030 our base deal is what youd expect a 16 year old to earn were happy with it and hes happy with it
4782031 jordans got this beam at home and on it he hangs every jumper hes had tracy says
4782032 they are exactly how they were when he played in them he says thats how i wore it thats what i did in it thats the stain i got wearing it and you cant wash it
4782033 his room smells like a locker room but theyre all there
4782034 i told jordan you need a back up plan he said no mum i just want to play football she says
4782035 im just so proud of him as a kid hed record a game on the video watch a part of the game pause it then run outside and practise what he just saw
4782036 some kids take the wrong path they drink or go to parties but jordan has no interest in that
4782037 i know he would love to play for queensland and im sure hed love to captain the titans tracy said
4782038 i said to him the other day youve played first grade what are you going to do now he said i dont know ill think about it
4782039 if someone invented a chemical to put in beer thatd keep it cold that gave you cancer too wed take our chances with the fucking cancer wouldnt we

4782041 i saw them up there other day lining the fields i knew they was coming to holler at their kids in their jibber jabber i liked it better when they stuck to blowing up airplanes full of their own kind and knocking off whatever hindoo politicians they could get near
4782042 yeah i just went by the park only white skin on it belonged to the referee to be fair though all the kids were yelling at one another in english
4782043 those kids will be shooting one another in the park instead of playing sports before long half of them are probably already selling dope to the white kids at school thats if they arent still going to their all brown terrorist training school its gang warfare out there beer and these brown cunts are right at home going to a teenage funeral every so often
4782044 i was in for surgery this week i was bleeding out of my ass so the doctor sent me to the hospital for a specialist to have a look up my ass id talked to some people who went through the procedure if thats what you want to call it wide awake watching the picture of the inside of their ass with the doctor like they were watching a particularly dirty hockey game doctor shot me up with demerol i have a feeling the doctor stole my virginity but i dont remember shit next thing you know i woke up in another room high as willie nelson nurse said they scooped a hemorrhoid out of me about three feet long guess maybe thats why i feel like i was prison raped you want another beer

4782046 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy

4782056 we use things like that and comments like that fuel us to get us even more excited
4782057 this is something that i dreamed of as soon as i started swimming winning an olympic gold medal in athens i was able to do that and ive been able to surpass my goals
4782058 if i had glided i would have ended up being way too long
4782059 i ended up making the right decision to take a sort of short fast stroke to get my hand on the wall first
4782060 i was saying to myself this is pretty special look around and try to remember this moment
4782061 its not over yet phelps said after winning no 7 in todays fingertip finish over milorad cavic in the 100 butterfly
4782062 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4782063 catherine the great in her native kenya and who won silver at athens four years ago is the favourite for the marathon she has won gold silver gold at the last three world championships
4782064 when i arrived here i didnt expect for sure to be in this final i arrived very tired nadal said
4782065 im very happy to have this experience in my life
4782066 no not mixed feelings at all its grant all the way im happy for my boy but theres not a shadow of doubt who im backing
4782067 no matter what happens and people said he was this or that i said you never learn you never discount the champion and i was absolutely rapt hes been lacking a little bit of speed but this is his zone and he looked good last night i havent spoken to him to find out how hard it hurt but its very positive for him to be able to come out and do that
4782068 china have been hopeful but they dont seem to understand that i havent had him long enough to put a 1500m base in
4782069 i saw the best opportunity with the 400m second so i worked him primarily for that
4782070 im rapt hes in the final thats all i wanted he was ranked 11th coming in and it was a tough field and as it has turned out he had to drop at least six seconds on his pb to make it and he dropped 10
4782071 i think it final will be a bit faster than hacketts 14 38 92 to win and well see
4782072 its new territory for everybody this is a 20 second faster final than in athens
4782073 the world has moved and the impact of a race that fast to make the final will tell on people and probably well only be geniuses after the fact and you will know who has done the work and whose body can rebound
4782074 possibly it may be but i havent put that age thing into it
4782075 other people have mentioned that but i havent factored that in the work hes done ive heard hes done and hes kept it up if his age was a factor it would have shown in his preparation and he seems to have been able to handle that
4782076 i feel confident and i hope hes got that one great swim left in him
4782077 drew didnt want to talk about it too much and i didnt want to ask him
4782078 i think hes feeling all right now tomorrow who knows
4782079 i didnt want to know what the options were with putting other people in the boat

4782181 for kids in the scene there is more about i need to prioritise my life around what im wearing and what im buying rather than what im paying for hartmann 24 told insider
4782182 in the circles i run in that is definitely the common occurrence fashion is a priority
4782183 most definitely just recently i got myself a pair of ksubi biker boots that were definitely out of my budget for that week but thats what i wanted and thats what i ended up spending the money on that week my phone bill was delayed because of the last pair of boots i wanted them

4782196 since the 1950s there has been a remarkable escalation in the use of the word mission among christians
4782197 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4782198 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4782199 the finance part is the binding part but many people think they might as well work out lifestyle clauses
4782200 it wouldnt surprise me if fidelity or weight was a clause it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4782201 we just thought it makes good sense that in the event of a separation not that we think its going to happen that what we bought into the relationship is protected

4782223 a major issue is russias contention that the region of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4782224 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4782228 i converted while i was in canada and we bought the space for the mosque in 1993
4782229 haitians would like to have the truth and islam will bring it to them if we follow allah and the prophet muhammad peace be upon him i think things can change those who dont have anything tend to help out it is in some way inborn to us as haitians as well as muslims to help out so that principle of responsibility of helping those less fortunate resonated very well

4782231 allah says that if a man kills another man it is as if he has killed all humanity the people who did what they did in new york they are not even human islamic people use the weapon of their love because violence as weve seen here in haiti will not take us anywhere

4782237 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation

4782276 the check was from senator barack obama and made out to oil companies as payment for his vote on the 2005 energy bill that provided nearly 3 billion in subsidies for oil and natural gas production
4782277 a local volunteer found the valuable check at a gas station near the tallahassee airport yesterday
4782278 we can only assume that the document was mistakenly dropped by senator barack obamas campaign manager david plouffe he likely stopped at the gas station to check the tire pressure on his rental car prior to heading to last nights campaign fundraiser in tallahassee
4782279 i want to take a minute here on this issue because i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it
4782280 i spoke up against the administration and congress and senator obama when they gave us an energy bill with more giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems

4782306 we must have walked about three miles through the hospital corridors during her contractions
4782307 the next day neither of us could work out why our feet were sore
4782308 our antenatal teacher stressed the need to keep an open mind and make decisions as we went along
4782309 it proved to be very useful in what turned out to be a long labour
4782310 i ended up rubbing my wifes foot all the way through labour
4782311 she told me to squeeze her foot until it hurt so she could focus on that pain instead
4782312 but i did cut the umbilical cord that was easy
4782313 jenny was having a contraction and in pain and the midwife said something like ill just break the waters while im here shall i i stepped in and said lets just wait until we can discuss it with jenny the midwife was a bit suprised but i knew jenny didnt want anything done without the chance to discuss it and she wasnt able to talk just then
4782314 we ended up watching a video together at home during early labour
4782315 not only was it a good way to relax but it was really very bonding

4782333 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4782334 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4782335 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4782336 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4782370 they should make an accurate assessment of their financial situation including living expenses and any debt commitments they have
4782371 people often need the incentive of getting quick results people feel better with each debt they no longer have to make
4782372 if you are someone who doesnt need to see short term results you should pay the debt with the highest interest rate first
4782373 most banks have a financial hardship team that will not be the collections area
4782374 if you are in hardship and the lender wont negotiate any reduction in payment or hardship variation you can apply to vcat credit division for the tribunal to consider whether the company should agree to a hardship variation
4782375 these arrangements sound very attractive because it puts all your debts in one place with one easy payment
4782376 but when you consolidate all your debts you mix together short term and long term debts into one package which may end up costing you more than it would have to keep paying your individual debts because by mixing them together you stretch the payment times on your short term debt
4782377 the real danger is they consolidate but they dont stop using the credit cards
4782378 they are good for people who have disposable income to pay something especially if they have assets to protect like a house
4782379 and also for people who cant make informal arrangements with their creditors
4782380 people need to understand that applying for a debt agreement under the bankruptcy act will go on the public record and your credit report

4782390 as young miss buffalo 2008 nnenna received a 500 scholarship
4782391 the key message wed like to get across is that if you try and claim the grant ineligibly you will be caught
4782392 we understand that circumstances change if youve claimed the grant and you believe you shouldnt have its best to contact the state revenue office sooner rather than later
4782393 every parent who chooses a name for their child is carrying out a self projection of their hopes for that child

4782395 we want the precautions for the pill written on the outside of the pill packaging
4782396 we want youngsters to know how important it is to read the awareness notices

4782404 the young bloke paramedic was a bit panicky i think he hadnt delivered a baby before
4782405 it was a bit stressful because we didnt hear any noise
4782406 weve got a much smaller surface area to play on and there are a lot more one on one contests
4782407 its a lot harder on the body and in afl they have got more freedom to do what they want in netball you have less time to make a decision and less room to move
4782408 netballers dont get as much recognition as they deserve we need more sponsorship though were getting there
4782409 the reality is that all cities that have water shortages have to look at it
4782410 reusing treated water for drinking purposes is definitely part of australias water future
4782411 we are already the driest continent and climate change is making that worse so its very important that australia is one of the first countries to adopt recycled water and recycled water for drinking
4782412 they should be investigating the possibility of using that water to replenish our reservoirs and eventually have it coming out of our taps
4782413 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4782414 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside the country await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations

4782424 if the mother thinks her sons being robbed of an education she needs to have a close look at herself because she is letting the child do this
4782425 we will see the informational warfare machine start working the public opinion is already under pressure there will be a growing anti iranian militaristic hysteria new information leaks disinformation etc

4782431 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
4782432 soon another crisis will grip the persian gulf area and that is the legitimacy crisis of the monarchies and traditional systems in the region
4782433 the next crisis predicted to cover mainly the persian gulf is the crisis of legitimacy of the monarchies and traditional systems which considering current circumstances cannot survive
4782434 such suspicious comments do not at all help build trust among states of the region
4782435 they can only stoke conflicts and drag the region into a cycle of dangerous crises
4782436 the whole world must know that ending the conflict requires an end to the israeli occupation of the lands that were occupied in 1967 including east jerusalem
4782437 we dont distinguish between a settlement that was built today and one that was built 35 years ago
4782438 israel is trying to deal with the west bank as a separate entity
4782439 this has been the case since the unilateral israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip in 2005
4782440 soon another crisis will grip the persian gulf area and that is the legitimacy crisis of the monarchies and traditional systems in the region

4782660 cuando yo crezca voy a ser tal y tal o voy a hacer esto y lo otro o voy a expresarme a m mismo en esta forma u otra o voy a crear un mundo basado en la imaginaci n basado en mi habilidad para ver imaginar y so ar
4782661 y estoy m s que enojado al respecto gabriel se supon a que ellos iban a traerme mis sue os no se supon a que yo tuviera que crear los m os propios yo renunci a mis sue os hace mucho tiempo yo renunci a ese tejedor de sue os el ni o de la maravilla el que ten a todas las expectativas que pod a imaginarse y ponerse en esa realidad y vivir ese sue o
4782662 dame cinco minutos mientras me convierto en el pr ncipe encantado
4782663 tal vez en una vida tenga mis sue os tendr la realizaci n de quien soy
4782664 vuelvan a ser los magos que son despierten al ni o m gico ese ni o maravilla ese tejedor de sue os que es cada uno de ustedes utilicen ese coraje de su pasi n y su voluntad para tener un sue o para implementar ese sue o a trav s de las herramientas con las que hemos estado trabajando con ustedes
4782665 yo tengo este sue o gabriel pero entonces surge este sentimiento este sentimiento de duda o de no ser lo suficientemente bueno o de no merecer o de que necesito sabotearme de alguna forma en este martirio cu l es el meollo del asunto que no me permite tener un sue o
4782666 si yo lo puedo hacer tambi n yo puedo tener un sue o
4782667 porque la seguridad es m s importante que tener mi sue o cuando toco los miedos de supervivencia de mis aspectos de seguridad de pronto ese sue o no es tan importante como pens que lo era
4782668 no me atrevo gabriel a tener esa expectativa en esos sue os as que la mayor parte del tiempo en lugar de so ar y traer mi sue o a la realidad me la paso especulando y fantaseando acerca de ellos qu tal si que tal si esto o lo otro tal vez deber a o podr a todos los deber a hubiera podr a
4782669 oh gabriel yo he tenido este sue o de el amor de mi vida con el que quiero compartir mi existencia entera con el que quiero compartir mi amor yo quiero de verdad crear una situaci n el sue o de tener a esta maravillosa alma gemela en mi vida pero no me atrevo a so arlo no me atrevo a so arlo y entonces lo fantaseo yo fantaseo acerca de esto y entonces construyo muchas alucinaciones de mi fantas a entonces miro hacia el mundo las relaciones hacia otros y mi situaci n a trav s de esas alucinaciones fundamentales de esta forma me protejo de tener un sue o en su lugar me voy por la fantas a la fantas a es mejor que nada
4782670 as que con qu partes de cualquier aspecto de las relaciones son con las que no puedo intimidar con qu partes no puedo estar a tiempo con de qu elementos de una relaci n sigo estando temeroso en referencia a mis aspectos de amor c mo veo el amor
4782671 por tanto mi alucinaci n central en lo que concierne a mi sue o en lo que concierne a la relaci n siempre se va a quedar atr s yo voy a ver a trav s de los ojos de esa alucinaci n central esa fantas a medular
4782672 que obstruye el camino para decirme a m mismo la verdad en relaci n a mis sue os
4782673 por qu ser que no me atrevo a so ar esto o aquello por qu no me atrevo a tener expectativas acerca de crear en esta forma o expresar mi creaci n de esta manera qu me est obstaculizando qu bloquea el camino junto con mis alucinaciones y fantas as porque si yo puedo vivir mi vida en una fantas a y puedo permitirme que una estructura social se haga cargo de mi pensar en lo que es no conseguir un trabajo incre ble en estos d as como lo han notado entonces no tengo que tener un sue o no tengo que ser responsable no tengo que responder por nada
4782674 otros dicen algo y esto otro surge o ellos act an de esta forma y aparece este sentimiento
4782675 qu papel de control uso siempre para protegerme de mi sue o
4782676 oh dios m o no me siento seguro teniendo este sue o voy a tener que tomar responsabilidad por esto que me va a suceder ya no estar en control y voy a tener que usar uno de esos mecanismos y dramas de control esa es la nica forma en la que me siento a salvo y seguro
4782677 ese sentimiento de no ser lo suficientemente bueno he estado tratando de deshacerme de ese he intentado destruirlo o eliminarlo de mi existencia por no se cuantos a os voy a tratar solo un poco m s de tiempo no voy a aceptar ese sentimiento entonces tendr a que aceptar la posibilidad del fracaso
4782678 porque la elecci n que hice sobre esto estaba basado en algo que quer a evitar de esta forma no puedo realizar mis sue os entonces en lo que respecta a mis compromisos cu les son los planes
4782679 yo no puedo tener un sue o yo no puedo ser el tejedor de sue os yo no puedo ser independiente yo no puedo ser aut nomo el mundo no me puede cumplir mis sue os ellos pueden cumpl rselos a todos los dem s gabriel pero no a mi por qu
4782680 no es seguro para mi tener sue os nunca encontrar formas de manipular para hacerlos
4782681 cu les son todas las lecciones que he aprendido c mo tienen un v nculo com n c mo vino la lecci n de vida que particularmente me concierne cu l contin a siendo siempre el aspecto para mi para nadie m s que yo diablos siempre mis aspectos desde que era ni o no lo comprendo pero esto es lo que siempre obstruye el camino de mi sue o
4782682 porque cuando me enfrento a una lecci n en lugar de verla como un reto como lo hace un guerrero espiritual la veo como algo que me hace v ctima o me hace da o me veo como una v ctima de la circunstancia una v ctima del mundo a mi alrededor no me veo como un tejedor de sue os no veo cada lecci n que llega como un reto y como una oportunidad para crecer hacia mi sue o
4782683 por qu ser gabriel que sigo aprendiendo la misma condenada lecci n que cuando ten a ocho a os por qu sigo atrayendo las mismas circunstancias a la misma gente las mismas situaciones por qu ser que cuando comienzo a andar sobre mi sue o lo abandono por qu ser que cuando comienzo a andar por mi sue o lo tengo que sabotear por qu es que siento que debo de ser m rtir cada vez que conecto con mi sue o por qu siento verg enza o me siento defectuoso cuando entretengo la idea de tener mi sue o y de traerlo a la realidad cu les son los aspectos de verg enza que surgen o c mo es que cuando me atrevo a tener un sue o siento que tengo que volverme tan narcisista tan sobre vigilante para cuidar ese sue o para protegerme con ese sue o entonces me voy hacia mis fantas as mis alucinaciones centrales y ese sue o se va justo por la ventana
4782684 cu les son los roles de manipulaci n que juego cu les son los roles en los que siempre caigo en relaci n a otros c mo es que siempre conozco al manipulador y siempre juego como v ctima o soy siempre el manipulador y siempre conozco a la v ctima o juego al manipulador y conozco a alguien que se va el indiferente ausente abandonado
4782685 que me lo impide en esa rea entonces los aspectos de amor cu l es el aspecto central en relaci n al amor c mo lo sigo actuando qu patrones de comportamiento
4782686 cu les son las peque as en donde dejo ir la verdad en d nde no me puedo comprometer con mi verdad en d nde no expreso mi verdad por qu cu l es el patr n qu se est parando en el camino cu l es el miedo
4782687 no puedo decir la verdad si estoy tratando de manipular o tratando de controlar
4782688 he sido muy claro al respecto estoy realmente claro acerca de mis compromisos estoy muy claro y se cu ndo mis patrones debilitan mis sue os en qu niveles se debilitan y en que niveles est n para mi es siempre un aspecto de control no importa yo no tengo ning n problema con los aspectos del amor o de seguridad yo no me siento inseguro acerca de eso puedo saltar de un puente y sentirme seguro pero debo ser capaz de controlarlo es ah donde yace mi patr n o yo paso por todos esos niveles y entonces cuando se refiere a mi verdad acerca de mi sue o qu otros niveles traigo siempre me miento a m mismo siempre me voy a la fantas a porque no puedo tolerar la verdad o decir la verdad o tenerla o poseerla o expresar la verdad a qu le tengo miedo voy a ser abandonado voy a ser castigado
4782689 es siempre algo que es para alguien m s pero no para mi gabriel yo no se es solo para alguien m s es demasiado complicado muy dif cil simplemente no puedo llegar ah simplemente no tengo el valor o el compromiso no tengo claro cual es mi intenci n y no tengo ninguna expectativa no se como elegir o establecer metas
4782690 la raz n por la que he evitado completar mi lecci n de vida y tener mis sue os es porque si las cosas fueran tan buenas tendr a que irme porque si esto realmente verdaderamente se vuelve un lugar celestial donde vivir por qu querr a estar aqu
4782691 for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god
4782692 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4782693 i joined the team to help spread the eco word about water conservation responsible stewardship wildlife importance etc the event started as an outreach effort i believe we went much farther sponsoring and lifting up this message for children and adults and sharing christ in this way with our neighbors
4782694 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4782695 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4782696 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4782697 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4782698 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4782699 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4782700 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4782701 i actually thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4782702 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i let my roar out
4782703 i really dont know what to say i guess ive had the perfect situations all week
4782704 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4782705 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4782706 i just have one race left the relay and then its done
4782707 tying spitzs record is pretty cool its great to be a part of all of this
4782708 not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4782709 under our rules we do listen to protests we looked at video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second after phelps one was stroking and one was gliding
4782710 two independent timing systems showed exactly the same on the time phelps was 50 58 cavic was 50 59
4782711 the automatic timing systems are in perfect order and there are no doubts
4782712 although the rules dont allow for team leaders to watch the video footage i had a meeting with the serbia team leaders to afford them the opportunity to see the video themselves because we dont want them to go away feeling something is lost
4782713 the serbian team were very satisfied and agreed with the comments of the referee
4782714 michael phelps is the greatest ever and he would have been first in this race any how the question was whether to share the gold medal or not to share
4782715 but what the referee saw was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever the first arrival was michael phelps
4782716 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4782717 i am not angry i knew it would be a fast race and i knew michael would be fast
4782718 i knew he would be coming at me there was no need to look over to try and see him i saw his shadow coming in my goggles
4782719 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4782720 i thought you might like to know of two upcoming performances scheduled in the us i shall be performing in the impulse artists series in houston texas from september 12th to 17th including chamber and outreach programmes with a solo recital on the 17th and then in the dame myra hess recital series in chicago on february 18th 2009 ill send more info later best regards sodi

4782722 probably with a little help from some pretty good drugs
4782723 suppose back at the beginning of time there were great forces of both good and evil and juxtapose they did battle over looooooooooooong periods of time and their powers were exponentially greater than anyones powers today aaaaaaand good won the great twilight struggle but some members of the dark forces maybe the most powerful and meanest of them all was never kilt or arrested the idea that that dude is still walking the earth isnt an impossibility ya know
4782724 hes probably some poor schlep who spends all his time lying around thinking about the old days and telling himself hes still a bad ass even though hes a bitter lonely pathetic drunk who mostly just wallows in self pity

4782735 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions

4782737 are the males of this species addicted to kinky sexual practices such as drinking girls piss if so they should just go to a prostitute or broach the subject of piss drinking with their wives its a bad mistake on their part because for one thing the female hormones from the contraceptive pill are being excreted in girls piss into the water supply via the flush toilet then the men are drinking recycled girls piss when they turn on the tap and the female hormones in the water supply are making the men of this species infertile and making them grow breasts

4782763 i believe that xandros can do an excellent job of representing microsofts interests in the linux market and im sure that the xandros vcs are happy with the deal they made with microsoft
4782764 so far microsoft hasnt revealed any legitimate claims of intellectual property infringement their strategy appears to be to coerce weak players in the open source space to fold this is reminiscent of the play made by sco a few years ago which some say was financed by microsoft maybe that was just their trial run

4782768 ive talked to the folks at nero about their commercial linux offerings and they made it clear that linux needs to be more broadly accepted as a consumer platform before third party app sales for linux will take off
4782769 this is my custom quit message i am quitting now bye cu l8r g8r
4782770 i have no problem with someone who protests against the gpl computer users freedom but not in a foss linux forum i don t go to windows forums criticising microsoft and people who are in the forum
4782771 i think there are three major types of critics of mono in the open source community those who think microsoft pays novell for developing mono to take over the world those who think mono is a project that will face patent problems in the future because microsoft will claim copyright infringement and those who have a problem with novell because of the patent agreement with microsoft
4782772 mono is largely based on two emca standards ecma 334 aka c and ecma 335 aka cli or common language infrastructure
4782773 mono itself is a fantastic piece of software and one of the best programming environments linux users got since ages
4782774 these sites would typically pick a dozen articles from the foreign media mostly american and british but also that of the baltic states and eastern europe and translate them into russian needless to say they usually do their best to pick the most heinous articles most of them full of bad reporting and stereotypes about russia
4782775 this may seem relatively innocent but inosmi has quickly gained a large following which particularly delights in commenting on articles mostly to report on inaccuracies in the articles and ignorance of their authors
4782776 sites like inosmi do their best perpetuate the myth of the
4782777 nature of things in russia this in itself is quite comical as russians themselves squandered most of their independent media in the early putin years arguably they are in much greater darkness
4782778 why the f u d against opengl 3 0 so it was with some interest to read on theregister and slashdot that the release of opengl 3 0 was met with heavy resistance by existing developers thats why the actual developers at siggraph responded so differently than the reports from thereg and slashdot would have people believe

4782780 industry experts have speculated that windows 7 will also have more virtualisation technologies onboard as well as tools that make it easier for people to get at their data and programs as they use different machines

4782785 you can actually do some pretty decent farming with those and death amp decay but youll be death striking a lot to get health back most dks will probably go blood for grinding its not strictly ae but you pretty much never die because you gain back so much health you can aoe grind but youll be using a lot of melee abilities too i do quasi aoe with unholy and it is fun but its probably a bit slower and less efficient than blood but with morbidity corpse explosion unholy blight wandering plague and desecration in talents and pestilence blood boil and death and decay in baseline you can ae to some degree
4782786 to inherit eternal life an hour a week would you settle for 45 minutes the lawyers question should not surprise us after all most everything that you get in this world is based on your performance we learn quite early in life that there is no free lunch what have you done for me lately

4782798 major crop yields fell by almost two thirds during the 1990s due to land degradation caused by loss of forest droughts floods and tidal waves acidification due to over use of chemicals as well as shortages of fertiliser farm machinery and oil
4782799 vulnerable soils require an expansion of restorative policies and practices such as flood protection works tree planting terracing and use of organic fertilisers
4782800 recognising such issues the country adjusted its legal and administrative framework designating environmental protection as a priority over all productive practices and identifying it as a prerequisite for sustainable development
4782801 the conflict between socio economic progress and a path of truly sustainable development is likely to be further aggravated unless emerging issues can be settled in time

4782867 the war began as an ill considered move by georgia to retake south ossetia by force
4782868 saakashvilis larger goal was to lead his country into war as a form of calculated self sacrifice hoping that russias predictable overreaction would convince the west of exactly the narrative that many commentators have now taken up

4782936 the bottom line is that the two main parties in zimbabwe have to come to some compromise for the good and betterment of the people of zimbabwe
4782937 our people are suffering the situation is a disaster and an urgent solution is called for
4782938 i cant go into the merits of what are the sticking issues but if you are not going to compromise then there is no point in dialoguing
4782939 well i liked the way that we came out here today
4782940 i thought we came out fired up for practice and i thought that some groups really tried to take leadership and we gave great effort we need to practice smarter and stay off the ground but some of that is created because they are trying to impress their coaches and play with good effort we got a lot accomplished this morning it would have been a normal tuesday practice thats what we did how we would conduct a practice we have to get used to that tempo
4782941 theres been a lot been thrown at them but im impressed with the group
4782942 they are competing for spots its a group that has a lot of confidence and understands football pretty well and is very talented
4782943 the first group feels comfortable with each other and we are still rotating grayson in there at guard and hes doing a nice job i think petrus came back and played better in the scrimmage than he has at practice so that was good the second group is still coming around
4782944 the other day tyler wilson had a very good scrimmage he was very impressive with the way he distributed the ball and with his accuracy hes still behind in the understanding of the offense nathan knows the offense better but is not throwing the ball as accurately as he did all spring so he needs to come out and play better tomorrow alex mortensen has been doing a good job each time he has gone in he operates the offense and really understands the running game and has an opportunity to move the team because he gets us out of bad plays
4782945 well i liked the way that we came out here today
4782946 i thought we came out fired up for practice and i thought that some groups really tried to take leadership and we gave great effort we need to practice smarter and stay off the ground but some of that is created because they are trying to impress their coaches and play with good effort we got a lot accomplished this morning

4782948 youre just going to have to live with his mistakes for a little while hes athletic and physical and that is the type of player that we want on defense the young linebackers really havent stepped up in that roll as of yet thats a patch work in the defensive front we are pretty stable but the main thing is that all of a sudden you have a bunch of the young kids out there

4782951 shrinking down a 50 watt pc architecture will not create the discontinuity this industry needs the culmination of nearly 1 000 man years of engineering tegra is a completely ground up computer on a chip architecture that consumes 100 times less power mobile internet and computing devices built with tegra are going to be magical

4782967 theres always going to be nay sayers people that are going to say its fake but thats fine because you cant control everybody but i can control what i do my attitude how i approach the situation
4782968 how i approach the situation is i want to do everything in my power that football gives me to influence as many people as i can for the good because thats gonna mean so much more when its all said and done than just playing football and winning championships
4782969 thats kind of why i do the things preaching in prisons doing those different things trying to take advantage of that platform that god has blessed me with
4782970 the things he does he would be doing them even if he wasnt a heisman winner
4782971 tim has done a lot of things that opened my eyes and thats one of them
4782972 to have our children experience that with three other families it was a life changing experience its something were going to if possible do every year
4782973 in your own little way you made an impact on some people
4782974 those are just the pros and cons that come with what you do and how you do it ive been blessed to have some success at the college level so i have more obligations and more things i have to do sometimes you dont want to do that you just want to be a college student relax or something
4782975 but when i really sit down and think about it i want to do those things because those things are more important than playing football for me going and speaking in a prison is more important for me going to speak to a youth organization is more important to me than winning or playing a game
4782976 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4782977 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4782978 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4782979 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4782980 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4782981 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4782982 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4783036 because it is feeding longer fire seasons drier conditions and more lightning according to recent studies the fire season stretches about 78 days longer and individual fires last about 30 days longer
4783037 increased risk of catastrophic wildfires global warmings wake up call for the western united states
4783038 we must get at the root of the problem and reduce the global warming pollution that fuels more frequent and severe fires
4783039 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4783040 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4783041 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
4783042 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
4783043 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4783044 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
4783045 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
4783046 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
4783047 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
4783048 in a way this whole study can be summed up by asking how many trees does a wolf represent
4783049 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved
4783050 stable isotopes ecological integration and environmental change wolves record atmospheric carbon isotope trend better than tree rings
4783051 factoring in only the public sector costs for maternity care delivery and one year of infant related care for those contraceptive clients who would be eligible for medicaid maternity care in their state if they became pregnant
4783052 at the same time the costs of birth have gone up as well
4783053 federal and state budgets are so tight it is important to demonstrate the savings for people who might be skeptical about the benefits that it is fiscally prudent it is not only a good thing to do it makes economic sense it can really help depoliticize an issue
4783054 by far most companies are pursuing very limited footprints toe prints really instead of comprehensive ones
4783055 a company that is looking to move toward bio based materials may find it far more cost effective to encourage purchases of green power in its supply chain when they look at its total supply chain carbon footprint
4783056 animal fighting is exceedingly cruel and has a corrosive effect on the communities where it exists
4783057 i am pleased to lend my support in the effort to punish the animal fighters who abuse animals for profit
4783058 cockfighting is now outlawed in all 50 states and cockfighters cannot go to any state to find refuge for this practice
4783059 it is time for louisiana cockfighters to recognize the rule of law and to abandon this barbaric hobby our society will tolerate this conduct no longer
4783060 its hard to think of an issue these days that doesnt have a science or high tech angle to it
4783061 my real goal is to make the dialogue more based in knowledge and fact because i think that will cool down the rhetoric and help bring opposite sides of the political spectrum together to reach agreement
4783062 there used to be a science advisory committee that was in constant contact with the president and was expected to think through technology and make suggestions
4783063 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range
4783064 the basics needed to be an informed critical thinking citizen of our country
4783065 a lot of people base their opinions on the equivalent of urban legends stories that are so powerful that you assume they are incontrovertible but which may not actually be true
4783066 people are afraid of radioactivity because it is invisible and unknown
4783067 but that doesnt mean that we cant detect and work with it part of this wariness is that people dont trust the government when it says dont worry well they dont have to trust the government they can actually learn what levels of radioactivity are and what they cause and make their own judgment
4783068 is outside the purview of physics but policy should be based on facts and understanding
4783069 when i teach my class i say i dont care if you are pro or anti nuke youre going to learn about nukes
4783070 many who describe the report even members of the panel when speaking as individuals put spin on their description that is not in the report
4783071 in the end the issues go beyond physics but we need to recognize that many measures we institute in the united states to deal with global warming can be classified as feel good measures or setting the example measures
4783072 we have to ask ourselves which example the developing world will follow our example of reducing carbon emissions or our example of generating enormous wealth
4783073 just in asking the question he gave me a great compliment
4783074 science should be nonpartisan and thats how i try teach it
4783075 though ultimately just for one i just dont know which one

4783096 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

4783099 use immunity informal immunity sentence reductions and even cash to the prosecutions other witnesses for their testimony against straub
4783100 straub claims that the courts refusal to compel the prosecution to grant use immunity to his defense witness violated his due process rights under the fifth amendment williams whether a defendant requesting compelled use immunity on the ground that his witness has relevant testimony that directly contradicts that of an immunized prosecution witness must prove that the prosecutions purpose in denying use immunity to the defense witness was to distort the fact finding process or merely that the prosecutions selective denial of use immunity had the effect of distorting the fact finding process
4783101 even where the government has not denied a defense witness immunity for the very purpose of distorting the fact finding process the government may have stacked the deck against the defendant in a way that has severely distorted the fact finding process at trial
4783102 w here the government has liberally used its discretion to grant immunity to numerous witnesses and the defendants witness could offer relevant testimony that would directly contradict that of an immunized government witness the trial may become so fundamentally unfair that the defendants due process rights are implicated
4783103 we now hold that for a defendant to compel use immunity the defendant must show that 1 the defense witnesss testimony was relevant and 2 either a the prosecution intentionally caused the defense witness to invoke the fifth amendment right against self incrimination with the purpose of distorting the fact finding process or b the prosecution granted immunity to a government witness in order to obtain that witnesss testimony but denied immunity to a defense witness whose testimony would have directly contradicted that of the government witness with the effect of so distorting the fact finding process that the defendant was denied his due process right to a fundamentally fair trial
4783104 we reverse the district courts denial of straubs request to compel use immunity

4783193 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4783194 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4783195 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4783196 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4783197 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4783198 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4783199 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4783200 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4783201 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4783202 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4783203 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4783204 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4783205 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4783206 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4783208 zionists are neither jews nor christians nor muslims they are followers of no monotheist faith they are merely members of a criminal party
4783209 we proposed that a referendum needs to be held at the entire land of palestine so that its whole residents including the jews the christians and the muslims would be able to decide their own countrys fate
4783210 this proposal is made based on the charter of the united nations the international laws and the rules of democracy but those that claim to be the standard bearers of democracy do not accept this solution
4783211 but i humbly tell you that the expiry date of that regime is over now that it is segregated in the world that the world nations and many governments are fed up with it and that it is left alone even in its own region
4783212 the best thing to do for those that established this regime is to de establish it and to clean the mess
4783213 at the beginning of the press conference you spoke of the hard times that the world nations are suffering from
4783214 as we see the neo colonialists are now oppressing the peoples of afghanistan iraq and other vast regions in the world those powers posses weapons of mass destruction and they commit all types of mischief against the mankind the same posers have found fault with the nuclear program of iran and are after imposing mounting pressure against you how do you evaluate such double standards
4783215 they are opposed to the advancement of countries like iran and turkey they wish us to remain dependent on big powers for good they are the enemies of our development programs otherwise the nuclear program is nothing but a pretext for them
4783216 fifteen years ago when there was no sign of the nuclear program the united states unilaterally imposed sanctions against us under such conditions that we had just got rid of the imposed war that the western governments had intrigued against us and we were thinking about reconstruction
4783217 let me narrate a memory for you tow years ago we discussed the nuclear issue at the us foreign relations council
4783218 the members of that council had a meeting with me they asked many questions and i replied ot all of them at the end one of them said we confirm that what you are doing is legal and within your rights range you have the right to be benefited from the nuclear energy and you have not breached any of your commitments but there is a problem if we would permit you to take advantage of the nuclear energy tomorrow turkey saudi arabia and egypt too would demand the same what could we do with them then
4783219 i told them what is wrong with that if it is a right for entire nations permit them to use it and if it is not do not use it yourselves either of course they had no convincing response basically they do not want to permit such countries as turkey iran and egypt to become advanced countries
4783220 they have not only not yield to getting disarmed from their horrendous nuclear weapons so far but also manufactured the fifth generation of those deadly bombs on the one hand and kept on creating obstacles in the way of the other countries that wish to have the nuclear power for peaceful purposes
4783221 how often have i found out that we grow to maturity not by doing what we like but by doing what we should how true it is that not every should is a compulsion and not every like is high morality and true freedom conscious willing is found even in infants but consciously accepted obligation is the sign of a mature man o grant that i may not always belong to the class of the infants who continually want to play the game differently who are never satisfied with the rules as they are
4783222 old man you give those dogs another piece of my food and im gonna kick you til youre dead
4783223 lets get together and have lunch and chat about wedding plans
4783224 the weekly said the fingerprinting of children brought to mind a famous photo of a jewish child in the warsaw ghetto showing the nazi identification number tattooed on his arm leading members of the government coalition responded by accusing the weekly of being catholic communist and being out of touch with italian citizens who want greater security
4783225 apa yang berlaku dalam konteks saiful bukhari bersumpah memperlihatkan keganjilan bilamana sepatutnya yang bersumpah adalah pihak yang kena tuduh tetapi apa yang berlaku adalah pihak yang menuduh
4783226 mendengar saiful melibatkan memohon kepada allah melaknatinya beserta keluarga dan keturunannya tanpa menyebutkan berapa lama seolah olah sampai ke hari kiamat mana ada sumpah yang meminta allah melaknati keturunan
4783227 tidak sepatutnya keturunan yang akan mewarisi kita dilaknati allah bersama atas permintaan kita sedangkan mereka keluarga tidak melakukan kesalahan
4783228 saya tidak nampak ini suatu cara yang sebenarnya berlaku dalam hukum syarak
4783229 iaitu siapa yang menasihati dirinya sama ada orang politik atau siapa
4783230 ianya seolah olah tidak diprogramkan secara teliti dengan persiapan yang tidak cukup sehingga sampai ke peringkat menyebutkan kalimah sumpah pun tersasul
4783231 ianya dibuat secara tergesa gesa sebab dirujuk kepada orang yang benar benar mengetahui prosiding sumpah sperti ini atau mungkin saiful tidak diberi penerangan yang sejelas jelasnya tentang akibat sumpah
4783232 kenapa beliau tidak boleh menunggu sehingga proses mahkamah berjalan dan hukuman dijatuhkan dan apa kepentingan dirinya untuk bersumpah
4783233 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy

4783236 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4783237 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4783238 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4783239 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4783240 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4783241 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4783242 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people

4783251 the obama campaign is going to be able to widen the playing field and put mccain on the defensive in states that he shouldnt have to be on the defensive in georgia montana alaska mccain will either have to put resources there or have to face the potential of losing them

4783346 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
4783347 simply because youre mentally ill that doesnt mean youre violent

4783424 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4783425 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4783426 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4783427 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4783428 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4783429 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4783430 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4783431 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

4783449 in a democratic republic we are responsible for the actions of our government neither future historians nor our descendants will care for our excuses
4783450 we elect our representatives nor have their been widespread protests against the post wwii expansion of the military industrial complex nor can we complain that we have not been told president eisenhowers warning was clear and there have been countless stories in the mainstream media about this over the past few decades if our response to these things is to blame others instead of our own fecklessness then perhaps we are not capable of self government
4783451 americans have voted protested written and used every peaceful means to try to reform their government
4783452 the next step up is local organizing for political purposes recruiting working the party system donating cash and time
4783453 if you dont like this chancellor the next step is to organize a party and work within the legitimate party structures of the german state donate time and money make sure your neighbors vote
4783454 ron paul will not be entered as an actual candidate i believe that this is due to corruption in the party system
4783455 foreign wars massive growth of government large deficits if we had elected a republican president none of this would have happened
4783456 as for my union comparison it is still entirely possible for a native born american to get killed for trying to organize a union
4783457 if one tries to rebuild neighborhoods walk the precincts get the vote out and otherwise work within the system the plutocrats will skim all the profits out of the system and all your effort will merely serve to enrich your enemies

4783467 we have textual accounts from the second century indicating the presence of a pagan population in zippori
4783468 it is clear the pagans had the influence and the ability to erect this temple in the center of the city
4783469 roman religion of the time was complex and variegated and involved civic religions mystery religions personal religions romans could function in different religious contexts
4783470 is a testament to the cosmopolitan nature of what was going on at that site
4783471 the problems between romans and jews culminated in the destruction of the galilee region and of the first jewish temple and pagans often were at the vanguard and worked with the romans
4783472 however by the end of the second century the jews understood they needed to live together with the romans and pagans
4783473 ronnie is making good progress in his battle with booze his family hoped his fling with eka happened because he fell off the wagon sadly for them he has genuinely fallen head over heels for her hes like a lovesick puppy and cant shake off his teenage like infatuation

4783541 i came here to barack obamas elementary school in jakarta looking for what some are calling an islamic madrassa like the ones that teach hate and violence in pakistan and afghanistan
4783542 ive been to those madrassas in pakistan this school is nothing like that
4783543 there is a lot of christians buddhists also confucian so thats a mixed school
4783544 the truth is that we do not know for sure how many moves there were or where obama was living when he attended the government run public school unfortunately what obama writes about his time in indonesia is not precise enough with regard to locations and dates to help us to sort it out obama was young when he was in indonesia and maybe some of the details of the experience are obscure even to him or maybe he is trying to minimize intentionally the extent to which the experience placed him in an islamic setting where he received public school education in islam again we simply dont know

4783554 were not sure at this point in the investigation how many of the students actually knew the intent was to hurt the teacher
4783555 but because they are kids they may have thought this was like a cartoon we do whatever and then she stands up and shes ok thats a hard call
4783556 from what i understand they were considered pretty good kids
4783557 but we have to take this seriously whether they were serious or not about carrying this through and thats what we did

4783573 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge

4783667 both china and russia kept silent on the details of the consensus they reached on energy cooperation in the first round of their negotiation in beijing on the weekend
4783668 it seems that a shift of russias energy export policy is under way russia might turn its eyes from the western countries to the asia pacific region the cooperation in the energy sector is an issue of great significance for sino russian relations the political and geographic closeness of the two countries would put their energy cooperation under a safe umbrella and make it a win win deal china russia ties are at their best times the two sides settled their lingering border disputes held joint military exercises and enjoyed rapidly increasing bilateral trade
4783669 moscow finds the idea of coordination of gas production and pricing policy with other gas exporters to be too tempting to abandon
4783670 this forum of gas exporters will set up the global gas balance it will give answers to the questions concerning when where and how much gas should be produced

4783672 when we saw that chopper there was a lot of tears and screaming
4783673 one guy dave passed out on the ground he was just physically exhausted
4783674 the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on the side of a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4783675 when steve set off the epirb emergency beacon i realised it was critical i thought what if we dont get out i want to live my life im too young to die
4783676 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just get buried and completely suffocate us so one of us had to get out and dig it
4783677 it was just impossible to get a helicopter into the area where the beacon had been activated
4783678 it was terrible we could see the chopper but you cant make contact or get help then it goes away and you know it will be night time soon and were stuck here for another night
4783679 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave

4783684 i nstead of stepping aside in deference to then state senator alice palmer obama decided to fight her for the nomination
4783685 axelrod most likely liked how the speech worked with his client in massachusetts and so decided to try it once again with obama perhaps thinking no one would notice
4783686 the clinton campaigns attack on obamas use of the line just words was widely panned as a baseless and desperate ploy her coverup might go over even worse
4783687 we have our fingers crossed for her wells and we will work on it overnight and take a risk if we have to
4783688 if she was to tear it totally and be out for six months shes not to be too concerned about that
4783689 its a setback but well go away and learn from it definitely our heads arent down
4783690 we play every game like its the last game were going to play so we wont go into it any different in our mindset it definitely puts a bit of pressure on but im sure well be able to do it
4783691 i couldnt believe they made a save right on the goal line in the second half its disappointing i felt the pressure showed in some of our decision making we could have taken better options

4783711 we are going to end up playing somebody good and punching out of our weight but thats what an aussie does
4783712 obviously ive been struggling a bit it was good to just come out and play hard
4783713 im not worried about people saying youre the money man you should be playing better i had two bad games and im just trying to move on be positive keep a smile on my face and enjoy the olympics
4783714 he was great today he has handled the highs and lows of this great
4783715 weve got better with him each game today was our best game and his best personally
4783716 ive played with these guys only three or four games

4783720 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4783721 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4783722 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4783723 we go into the fall if nothing else a tested organization
4783724 this is like a high stakes trapeze act that these guys have because mistakes and gaffes matter oh so much in these contests
4783725 he has the energy and the forward looking vision to lead
4783726 he has to deal with the ghost on the stage and probably has to do that in a dramatic way
4783727 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4783728 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4783729 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4783730 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been
4783731 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4783732 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4783733 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4783734 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4783735 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4783736 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4783737 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others

4783744 this morning i said that for his birthday i would give him victory but still it is just a dream come true
4783745 right now im sure that robinho will stay for me it is not a problem and im not going to worry about it because he is going to be our player it is not a concern

4783747 i couldnt tell if i made it to the finals or not i looked up there and realized i didnt
4783748 i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics it just was one of those things that happened
4783749 maybe i could have used some more training or more races i kept trying to get my rhythm through each round
4783750 everyone left and it was just me and a small group of really close friends they didnt say it but they wanted me to leave
4783751 i dont want you to leave i still like you
4783752 im sick of girls always winning stuff its about time a guy won something like this
4783753 i come from an academic family and theyre a bit worried about it that i might not finish my degree
4783754 i saw the advertisement on tv and my sister was freaking out saying i had to enter
4783755 if youre going to do something like this and they tell you to change your body i guess you have to but otherwise its nobodys business
4783756 it is really tough the hardest thing to work out is which agency to go with
4783757 i am relaxed you just have to focus on the dives

4783770 the pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring i e 1998 that the cia had been drawing up its secret plan to raid tarnack farm
4783771 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
4783772 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
4783773 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
4783774 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
4783775 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
4783776 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
4783777 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
4783778 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4783779 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
4783780 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4783781 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
4783782 a cautionary tale about rushing to judgement in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act
4783783 please contact me upon your return to the states so we can continue this dialogue
4783784 received all of the department of defense documents on able danger and had found no mention of atta
4783785 the 9 11 commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9 11 to penetrate the al qaeda organization
4783786 one of the most important pieces of evidence the fbi would ever discover allowing investigators to map the links of the al qaeda network all across the globe
4783787 did not rec ognize the significance of what they had
4783788 keen to reveal the ambiguous role of the cia and to restrain washington from extending the war to iraq and elsewhere
4783789 what went wrong the c i a and the failure of american intelligence 14
4783790 the great conspiracy the 9 11 news special you never saw
4783791 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom
4783792 oh no silly he looks as much an outlaw as you do if you didnt have that ugly mustache you two would look like brothers
4783793 besides outlaws dont dress in suits and ties what well do is wait until uncle herold picks us up this afternoon and tell him about it hell know what to do
4783794 i know as much about guns as you and i have as much right as you
4783795 its okay peter pan im ready to grow up now

4783799 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4783800 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4783801 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4783802 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep

4783805 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4783806 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4783807 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4783808 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4783809 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4783810 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4783811 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4783812 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4783813 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4783814 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4783815 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4783816 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4783817 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4783818 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4783819 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4783820 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4783821 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4783822 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4783823 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4783824 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4783825 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4783826 we could level off at this rate for a while but i expect the pound will fall further
4783827 its not been a good week for sterling but today its more of a strong dollar story clearly the bank of england inflation report triggered the latest round of selling
4783828 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4783829 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4783830 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4783831 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4783832 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4783833 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4783834 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4783838 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4783839 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4783840 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4783841 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4783842 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4783843 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4783844 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4783845 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4783846 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4783847 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4783848 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4783849 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4783850 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4783851 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4783852 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4783853 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
4783854 kalau kertas pencalonanya ditolak pada penamaan calon di sini hari ini pkr masih ada calon
4783855 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4783856 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4783857 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4783858 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4783859 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4783860 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4783861 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4783862 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4783863 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4783864 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4783865 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4783866 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4783867 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4783868 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4783869 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4783870 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4783871 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4783872 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4783873 is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behavior which would place new selection pressures on populations and favor adaptive divergence

4783877 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4783878 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4783879 if you bought poisoned lead filled toys from china or adulterated medicine made in china if you bought tainted pet food made in china you know that elections matter after the last 8 years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
4783880 journalistiska ndam l eller konstn rligt eller litter rt skapande
4783881 given the enormous benefits we have seen from a lightly regulated internet and software market our government should refrain from imposing burdensome regulation
4783882 john mccain will focus on policies that leave consumers free to access the content they choose free to use the applications and services they choose free to attach devices they choose if they do not harm the network and free to chose among broadband service providers
4783883 while the internet has provided tremendous opportunity for the creators of copyrighted works including music and movies to distribute their works around the world at low cost it has also given rise to a global epidemic of piracy
4783884 john mccain supports efforts to crack down on piracy both on the internet and off
4783885 international agreements and enforcement efforts that ensure fair rewards to intellectual property
4783886 too much protection can stifle the proliferation of important ideas and impair legitimate commerce in new products to the detriment of our entire economy
4783887 pick strong except when given two choices pick 1 strong 1 weak
4783888 eliminate one by one until 2 players left then find winner among the two
4783889 return a dict of percentage of winning for each player strength
4783890 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4783891 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4783892 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4783893 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4783894 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4783895 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4783896 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4783897 who are open to doing something on the production side
4783898 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4783899 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4783900 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4783901 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4783902 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4783903 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4783904 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4783905 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4783906 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4783907 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4783908 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4783909 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4783910 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4783911 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4783912 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4783913 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4783914 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4783915 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4783916 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4783917 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4783918 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4783919 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4783920 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4783921 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4783922 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4783923 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4783924 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4783925 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4783926 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4783927 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4783928 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4783929 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4783930 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4783931 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4783932 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4783933 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4783934 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4783935 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4783936 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4783937 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

4783940 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4783941 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4783942 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4783943 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4783944 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4783945 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4783946 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4783947 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4783948 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4783949 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes

4783957 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4783958 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4783959 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4783960 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4783961 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4783962 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4783963 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4783964 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4783965 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4783966 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4783967 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4783968 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4783969 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4783970 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4783971 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4783972 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4783973 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4783974 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
4783975 you see it was the only workers i could get
4783976 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4783977 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4783978 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4783979 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4783980 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4783981 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4783982 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4783983 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4783984 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4783986 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4783987 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4783988 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4783989 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4783990 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4783991 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4783992 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4783993 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4783994 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4783995 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4783996 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4783997 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4783998 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4783999 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4784000 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4784001 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4784002 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4784003 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4784004 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4784005 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4784006 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4784007 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4784008 that was maybe the best performance ive ever seen out of my partner
4784009 in these conditions under this pressure i honestly cant say enough about him
4784010 he absolutely carried me i didnt do anything out there i was just a big guy out there every once in a while id turn around and set him
4784011 sean is a player who is going to make anyone who plays with him better he can do almost anything on the court
4784012 im big slow and clumsy and he covers all the ground i cant and makes up for all the little passing errors i do you witnessed all that tonight
4784013 this one was my game i carried my partner a little bit but he does the same for me all year long im not worried about it one bit hell get me back
4784014 hopefully neither of us will have to carry the other one well both be playing well
4784015 he is one of the best defensive players in the world
4784016 if they play like they did tonight they have a chance to beat anybody
4784017 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4784018 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4784019 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4784020 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4784021 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4784022 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4784023 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4784024 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4784025 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4784026 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4784027 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4784028 she told me a story of when she was working in a shop in the south and she overheard some of her customers complaining that they were always waited on by a canadian at that place she didnt understand what they were talking about and assumed they must be talking about someone else
4784029 after this happened several times with different patrons she mentioned it to one of her co workers
4784030 fellow workers used to use a name for inner city families that were known to not leave a tip canadians
4784031 if i had i would never send that out in an office wide e mail thats going to go to people who are going to be offended if they recognize it as such
4784032 i would never send that out in an e mail
4784033 fellow workers used to use a name for inner city families that were known to not leave a tip
4784034 a single returned piece of mail is not a reliable basis for challenging the right to vote
4784035 mail may be returned for many reasons including errors in the database from which the mailing is derived errors in the mailing labels failure to include an apartment number or poor matching criteria
4784036 partisan challengers who have obtained a list of returned letters shouldnt be allowed to strip ohio voters of their right to update their addresses

4784038 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4784039 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4784040 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4784041 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4784042 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4784043 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4784044 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4784045 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4784046 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law

4784049 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4784050 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4784051 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4784052 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4784053 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4784054 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4784055 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4784056 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4784057 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4784058 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4784059 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4784060 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4784061 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4784062 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

4784066 i did not encounter a sustained period in which anyone endeavored to spend what it would actually cost to make the sun the most essential and deep thinking and well written account of kind of storytelling were ushered out the door buyout after buyout
4784067 it is impossible not to wonder what will become of not just news but
4784068 well we did ask we did do our job by asking tough questions during the run up to the war
4784069 they asked a lot of questions but they asked even the right questions of the wrong people
4784070 much of u s medical care particularly the everyday business of preventing and treating routine illnesses is inferior in quality wastefully dispensed and inequitably financed
4784071 the time has come for radical change the management of medical care is too important to leave to doctors who are after all not managers to begin with
4784072 those who talked about health care planning in the 1970s now talk about health care marketing
4784073 the organizational culture of medicine used to be dominated by the ideals of professionalism and voluntarism which softened the underlying acquisitive activity
4784074 the restraints exercised by those ideals now grow weaker the health center of one era is the profit center of the next
4784075 we have heard that but were not sure how to handle it
4784076 developing a licensure process for leaders of health care organizations licensing doctors and health professionals has been going on for a long time but now leaders of health care organizations from hospitals to drug companies have as much if not more influence over health care and hence the health and safety of patients as do doctors yet
4784077 there are no requirements that leaders of health care organizations have any particular educational background knowledge commitment to health care values or for that matter that they have not committed crimes given the scope of bad leadership discussed on health care renewal maybe a licensing process for health care executives would at least ensure that they have not served time in the brig for theft
4784078 as the pendulum swings back from lay leader to clinician leader there is a strong and appropriate opportunity for physicians to reinsert themselves into a leadership role
4784079 in fact the time has perhaps never been more appropriate than today in a health care system that is complex troubled and challenging the physician ceo brings a unique set of skills to the business of medicine the successful physician leader however must understand the business of medicine as well as or better than he or she understands the practice of medicine training developing and equipping our future physician leaders with the necessary skill sets will be one of medicines many challenges as it expands into the 21st century

4784081 the measure in south dakota would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and their families
4784082 they are being deceptive by characterising this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive
4784083 t he truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban ion in the united states
4784084 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie

4784086 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4784087 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4784088 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4784089 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4784090 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4784091 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4784092 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

4784095 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4784096 this is exactly what the law says and what it allows
4784097 if the republicans are trying to close the window they would be violating the law they wrote
4784098 absolutely right on this one it could be the best thing shes done in office
4784099 an illegal loophole in the state law to advance same day registration and voting which was never a consideration when the general assembly passed the law
4784100 this has nothing to do with denying people access to the ballot
4784101 the issue is about whether or not safeguards are in place
4784102 they are trying to deflect and confuse and suppress voters
4784103 this is walking down the path of scaring and intimidating voters and suppressing the vote in an important election year
4784104 our hope is that everyone will take a step back and work together in voters best interests to find solutions to these questions rather than fight it out with press releases and lawsuits public squabbling just leads to voter confusion

4784107 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4784108 all childhood memories are unreliable we construct narratives to justify what we now think
4784109 can you produce one economist to support the gas tax holiday
4784110 that doesnt matter because you can just look it up on the internet
4784111 theres a lot we can do about education but first of all in our homes we have to turn off the tv more
4784112 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4784113 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4784114 i had to play three matches in less than 24 hours
4784115 i was angry about that but i focussed it all on the court i knew that the crowd would be against me
4784116 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4784117 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4784118 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4784119 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4784120 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4784121 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4784122 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4784123 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4784124 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4784125 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4784126 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4784127 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4784128 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4784129 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4784130 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4784131 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4784132 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4784133 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4784134 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4784135 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4784136 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4784137 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4784138 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4784139 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4784140 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4784141 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4784142 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4784143 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4784144 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4784145 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4784146 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4784147 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4784148 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4784149 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4784150 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4784151 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4784152 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4784153 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4784154 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4784155 what you lose on the swings you get back on the roundabouts
4784156 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4784157 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4784158 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4784159 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4784160 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4784161 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4784162 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4784163 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4784164 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4784165 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4784166 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4784167 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4784168 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4784169 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4784170 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4784171 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4784172 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4784173 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4784174 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4784175 if there any kind of magic in the world it must be the attempt of understanding someone or sharing something i know it almost impossible to succeed but who cares the answer must be the attempt
4784176 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4784177 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4784178 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4784179 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4784180 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4784181 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4784182 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4784183 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4784184 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4784185 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4784186 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4784187 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4784193 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4784194 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4784195 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4784196 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4784197 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4784198 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4784199 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4784200 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4784201 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4784202 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4784203 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4784204 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4784205 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4784206 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4784207 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4784208 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4784209 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4784210 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4784211 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4784214 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4784215 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4784216 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4784217 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4784218 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4784219 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4784220 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4784221 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4784222 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4784223 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4784224 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4784225 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4784226 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4784227 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4784228 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4784229 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4784230 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4784231 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4784232 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4784233 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4784234 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4784235 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4784236 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4784237 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4784238 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4784239 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4784240 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4784241 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4784242 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4784243 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4784244 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4784245 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
4784246 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
4784247 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4784248 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4784249 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
4784250 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
4784251 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
4784252 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
4784253 q where do you see russia fitting into this as it comes onto the scene
4784254 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4784255 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4784256 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time

4784416 see from from behind without the rest of you visible on the couch you look sort of like a i dunno like something curly and fluffy and fun to attack
4784417 its just a cat he doesnt even remember what he did by now
4784418 its in the air it tastes like snow and it sounds like it too
4784419 uh huh i can hear the air can you hear the air dad
4784420 hmm maybe not as well as you can cyrus tell me what does the air sound like
4784421 it just sounds like air and its not alla time its like only sometimes and sometimes dad sometimes its smiling and sometimes its frowning and other times its not doing much of anything and then i try to ask it but not with words you know but i think it ignores me and then i dont hear anything at all and its annoying cause sometimes it talks to me without me asking it and other times its quiet and i cant tell it to talk to me cause wind doesnt have ears and even if it did i dont think it speaks in words you know
4784422 yeah and and so sometimes when i can hear it it tells me not in words you know cause wind doesnt talk it just sort of makes faces
4784423 um but it tells me what the weather is going to do or feels like doing and sometimes it doesnt do what it tells me its gonna do so maybe i dont think the air even knows what its doing sometimes because sometimes it um sometimes you know it doesnt even do what it says its gonna do
4784424 so maybe it wont snow the wind wont make up its mind
4784425 but not the way you can learn it because you are an air shifter and im not
4784426 it might just snow soon which is precisely why we are here
4784427 air does have a distinct taste and smell before it snows cyrus but like you said perhaps it has a sound too
4784428 you cheated youre sposed to say ready set go ready set go dad lets start over
4784429 fanciful weather for once wouldnt you think so are you enjoying the sun
4784430 has this area gotten poor weather lately im afraid im new to this area
4784431 weve had dreary skies for the past weak or so with periods of rain now and again but mostly only the clouds and thick air but now that it seems to have cleared i seem to be getting new faces in here have you been in this town for long my lord
4784432 and please the title isnt necessary im but a merchant i apologize if my clothes fool your eye i try to assure my customers with my well to do appearance
4784433 oh a merchant then are you looking to settle in town perhaps i know of a man down several blocks who was thinking of leaving for better business perhaps you could barter for his space
4784434 i have always wanted to travel but its so expensive its not often we get traveling men through these parts what is it like
4784435 ill spare you but yes traveling has its pros and cons theres much to see after all i can certainly give you that but its not without its rough spots
4784436 well thats to be said for anything you do in life i think good and bad that is i trust even misers and lords have their rough patches despite their wealth
4784437 usually when we have poor business and hes feeling pessimistic
4784438 certainly ive helped him run it since my mother passed away julyan rest her
4784439 cyrus my lady may i have the pleasure of knowing yours
4784440 you may be feeling somewhat mentally uncoordinated that will be fading quickly do you remember anything
4784441 alright i have done what i could to mend the damage the sutorii priests did to your souls you seemed to have been absent from your shell pardon your body for quite some time however the effects of my work and your worldly absence should be wearing off soon do you understand any of that
4784442 digest let me digest that jus jus gime a minute
4784443 im going to vomit where am i where is where is valerrie sashann zevil uh nale did casin come am i dead i
4784444 i swore and shot upright against uh no judgment at all at the time
4784445 i take that to mean you are regaining the rest of your consciousness then
4784446 your two souls were damaged courtesy of the sutoriis work
4784447 i fought with them to let up on their procedures against your daemon whatever sort it is and told them their actions would only do more harm than good however
4784448 why do i feel like theres more to it than that ethan
4784449 only if im not the primary reason youre glaring like that
4784450 ethaniel ledori an ekyran you have a brother you frown a lot sall i know
4784451 her ladyship jyn suuhna high priestess and lead of the entire tri ring divinity house was my mentor
4784452 i was her best pupil do you know what this means
4784453 her ladyship suuhna i suppose she would have been the very lead of the book of nexus or whatever you people call it
4784454 and as her prize pupil that makes you rather talented in that area doesnt it
4784455 and for a spit of an organization a despicable zealous one at that to show such disrespect as to disregard the opinions of a man versed in such concepts for the sake of following through with their own blind foolish unconfirmed untested and unclean experiments on a mortals shell and soul its
4784456 his pointed boot met fiercely with a bale of hay producing a muted thud
4784457 they mutilated the nexus code and trifled in things laws of spiritual essence that they were not licensed nor properly trained to handle i warned lady valerrie i bloody warned her that what she was telling her priests to do was a disgrace to caella and her ladyship suuhna
4784458 i mean im the one who was cheated not you why are you pitching a fit granted i suppose i would be if i was in better shape to do so right now but
4784459 two thousand five hundred fifty five days of work and dedication
4784460 they looked down their noses at me and plain as day they dismissed every second of it do you know why
4784461 the next sutorii agent i see i will personally throttle for their ignorance and blind zealotry we were fools to appear before them hoping for assistance
4784462 so you mean this thing in me this daemon it cant be removed
4784463 ethan youre kidding me we have to make it gone dont you understand if casin gets a hold of its what he wants he can use it to become a bleeding god i have to be rid of this and save myself the trouble
4784464 with a twist of my wrist i have the capacity to completely rupture them and you would cease to be your soul would be ruined never to return to this plane again and casin would find himself properly foiled not another human being would suffer by his actions
4784465 and though i have been cursed with this power that any other being would abuse it is only in my right to never use it
4784466 and even that would be far simpler than separating these two they are so tightly woven
4784467 all of this within me and the sutorii thought me too petty and too foul to hear thinking they could do the impossible with methods that arent even appropriate to your situation they would have better luck making a tree into dog or a rock into a bird when your entire lifes work is looked upon like a shit a dog has just taken on ones shoe see if you do not become somewhat irked
4784468 and the next time you think to take her ladyships name in vain
4784469 you had better damn well hope i am not in earshot
4784470 if there are no objections i am going for a walk to shake off the disgusted chill of sticking my hand through your chest

4784586 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4784587 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4784588 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4784590 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4784591 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4784592 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4784593 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4784594 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4784595 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4784596 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4784597 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4784598 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4784599 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4784600 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4784601 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4784602 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4784603 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4784604 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4784605 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4784606 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4784607 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4784608 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4784609 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4784610 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4784611 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4784612 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4784613 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4784614 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4784615 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4784616 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4784617 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4784618 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4784619 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4784620 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4784621 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4784622 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4784623 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4784624 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4784626 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4784627 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4784628 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4784629 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

4784638 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4784639 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4784640 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4784652 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso

4784772 i was just motioning to the camera that michigan sucks
4784773 the movement of athletes across the globe is more prevalent these days so i do think its going to be more commonplace
4784774 the question is how we value the country of our birth and whether its important that athletes compete for a country other than their birth country
4784775 hes really honored to do it and we feel pretty good about letting him be flagbearer for us
4784776 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence
4784777 this rule is not against a nation or against china as some say
4784778 georgia brings for me the opportunity a very very big opportunity
4784779 has many many teams in georgia its my chance its now
4784780 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end
4784781 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4784782 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is not 1968

4784794 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4784795 i think it was the right strategy for those conditions
4784796 but i didnt want to get involved in a match race with ben i just wanted to sail around the course and protect my silver
4784797 resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4784798 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4784799 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4784800 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4784801 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4784802 we saw that many of the reactions of the russian army in georgian territory are exceeding the boundaries of international law
4784803 despite heavy wreckage in tskhinvali human rights watch has been unable to find evidence to back official russian claims that georgia carried out a
4784804 we go into the fall if nothing else a tested organization
4784805 this is like a high stakes trapeze act that these guys have because mistakes and gaffes matter oh so much in these contests
4784806 he has the energy and the forward looking vision to lead
4784807 he has to deal with the ghost on the stage and probably has to do that in a dramatic way
4784808 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4784809 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4784810 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4784811 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been
4784812 the honda civic hybrid is hamstrung by the primitive way it mixes electric amp engine power
4784813 it was a step backwards and not much to be excited about
4784814 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4784815 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4784816 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4784817 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4784818 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4784819 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4784820 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4784821 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4784822 must be one piece made of a neoprene type material and not have the ability to be adjusted
4784823 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4784824 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4784825 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4784826 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4784827 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4784828 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4784829 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4784830 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4784831 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4784832 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4784833 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4784834 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4784835 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4784836 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4784837 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4784838 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4784839 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4784840 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4784841 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4784842 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4784843 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4784844 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4784845 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4784846 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4784847 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4784848 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4784849 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4784850 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4784851 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4784852 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4784853 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4784854 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4784855 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4784856 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4784857 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4784858 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4784859 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4784860 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4784861 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4784862 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4784863 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4784864 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4784865 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4784866 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4784867 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4784868 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4784869 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4784870 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4784871 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4784872 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4784873 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4784874 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4784875 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4784876 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4784877 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4784878 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4784879 show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer
4784880 take the barometer to the top of the building attach a long rope to it lower the barometer to the street and then bring it up measuring the length of the rope the length of the rope is the height of the building
4784881 take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge of the roof drop the barometer timing its fall with a stopwatch then using the formula s 1 2 at 2 calculate the height of the building
4784882 there are many ways of getting the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer for example you could take the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer the length of its shadow and the length of the shadow of the building and by the use of simple proportion determine the height of the building
4784883 there is a very basic measurement method that you will like
4784884 of course if you want a more sophisticated method you can tie the barometer to the end of a string swing it as a pendulum and determine the value of g at the street level and at the top of the building from the difference between the two values of g the height of the building can in principle be calculated
4784885 if you dont limit me to physics solutions to this problem there are many other answers such as taking the barometer to the basement and knocking on the superintendents door
4784886 ludwig watzal a good german activist and a friend of palestine once wrote a touching review of the galilee flowers now he recanted and renounced me
4784887 but cowardice does not pay watzal repented alas the enemy does not forgive the repentant as easily as the church did in case of galileo as he could learn from the bitter fate of david irving he repented and humiliated himself and was punished anyway
4784888 i am really sorry for the man but in a way
4784889 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4784890 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4784891 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4784892 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4784893 obama is not a marxist or a radical yet it is clear that radicals have influenced his judgment
4784894 these books are cut from the same cloth made up of the same old debunked smears that have been floating around the internet for months
4784895 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him

4784923 a few years ago as i looked out at my retirement years i realized that there was a fundamental problem at the puny 5 7 annual returns m0st planners suggest i was going to need to set aside millions of dollars if i wanted to retire comfortably i would have to work till i was 80 just to accumulate a nest egg large enough for the retirement that i wanted i looked at the simple formula that said income rate of return capital it struck me that raising my rate of return would be far more doable than finding ways to salt away millions of dollars of capital so thats what i focused on and it worked
4784924 with my techniques which are based are on careful statistical analysis of markets and trading instruments over a very long time i can say with confidence that you dont have to put your life savings at risk in order to double your money every two years you just have to understand the trades you are executing and manage your total investment pool properly

4784928 yea let me know how the book is i could use something like that
4784929 how is your relationship with jesus are you seeking him on a daily basis are you learning his word and how allowing yourself and your life to be guided by the holy spirit
4784930 for we are gods own handiwork his workmanship a recreated in christ jesus born anew that we may do those good works which god predestined planned beforehand for us taking paths which he prepared ahead of time that we should walk in them living the good life which he prearranged and made ready for us to live
4784931 delight yourself also in the lord he shall give you the desires of your heart

4784940 had to happen that john would decide to have french fries
4784941 my intuition is p so im going to assume p
4784942 additionally i am not at all convinced that one needs to regiment the analysis as suggested by vihvelin here are the facts in a frankfurt case there is a triggering event that occurs to indicate that the agent is about to refrain the counterfactual intervener watches for that even and has the power and intention to intervene upon noticing the triggering event further the counterfactual intervener is a completely reliable triggering event detector and is completely reliable in carrying out his intentions given these facts it just seems intuitively obvious that if the relevant individual jones were about to refrain he would be rendered unable to refrain and thus it seems intuitively obvious that jones is unable to do otherwise given the facts of the case no argument employing hypothetical syllogism or transitivity appears to be required
4784943 im saying that in every argument that im aware of theres a bottom line appeal to intuition in order to justify one or more of the premises there needs to be truth makers for premises in an argument right
4784944 freedom of the will and the concept of a person
4784945 2 one is culpable for behaving ignorantly only if one is culpable for ones ignorance
4784946 2 one is culpable for behaving ignorantly only if one is culpable for ones ignorance
4784947 ignorance no longer excuses if one is culpable for that ignorance
4784948 rational capacities or how to distinguish recklessness weakness and compulsion
4784949 you think you can have free will in a deterministic world well what if god designed your entire life just like shakespeare writing the life story of characters in his plays surely thats not free will
4784950 so what god designed my life who cares i still satisfy the compatibilist requirements of your choice i still have free will i dont see any tension here at all
4784951 see hard compatibilists hard compatibilism is too hard not even hume can say it with a straight face not even hume can be consistent about his compatibilism because it results in absurdities
4784952 who can intend nothing but what is good and laudable
4784953 but of course thats not even analogous to the zygote argument shakespeare didnt design his characters to murder and so forth and then let them loose
4784954 terms of approbation arising from our disposition to praise and blame
4784955 i pretend not to have obviated or removed all objections to this theory with regard to necessity and liberty i can foresee other objections derived from topics which have not here been treated of it may be said for instance
4784956 derived from lines of thought that i havent here discussed
4784957 so we have to conclude either that those actions are not criminal or that god and not man is accountable for them
4784958 this objection consists of two parts which i shall examine separately 1 if human actions can be traced up by a necessary chain to god they can never be criminal on account of the infinite perfection of the being from whom they are derived and who can intend only what is altogether good and praiseworthy 2 if they are criminal we must conclude that god isnt perfect after all and must accept that he is the ultimate author of guilt and moral wickedness in all his creatures
4784959 the point is not that if god were the cause of everything then human actions would not be free the point is more that if god is the cause of everything then why is there evil
4784960 the second objection cant be answered so easily or satisfactorily it isnt possible to explain clearly how god can be the ultimate cause of all the actions of men without being the author of sin and moral wickedness
4784961 on account of the infinite perfection of the being from whom they are derived and who can intend only what is altogether good and praiseworthy
4784962 2 if they are criminal we must conclude that god isnt perfect after all and must accept that he is the ultimate author of guilt and moral wickedness in all his creatures
4784963 it isnt possible to explain clearly how god can be the ultimate cause of all the actions of men without being the author of sin and moral wickedness
4784964 2 if they are criminal we must conclude that god isnt perfect after all and must accept that he is the ultimate author of guilt and moral wickedness in all his creatures
4784965 so we have to conclude either that those actions are not criminal or that god and not man is accountable for them
4784966 i do not see in any of these passages a worry about whether human beings are responsible for their actions if god is the cause of everything
4784967 your interpretation seems to stake a lot on the significance of p and q in humes own thought where in reality p and q are only siginificant to hume insofar as they represent tools he can use to motivate his critics to accept his hard compatibilism
4784968 oh by the way religious person even though ive argued so fervently that my view of freedom is compatible and necessary for morality i havent removed all of the objections to this claim i dont agree with you that p that all human actions arent criminal thats just wrong but this other argument of yours q that god would be the author of all sin theres something to that argument i think you may be right about that

4784970 conscious experiences make a substantial positive contribution to our decision making
4784971 it still faces the fundamental problem that if what happens in the global workspace is rule determined it could be done without consciousness
4784972 how pain and other conscious experiences could operate in human motivation if they are not epiphenomenal
4784973 well it was well well before the agent was born long long before
4784974 just seems to be digging the compatibilist deeper and deeper
4784975 what interests me about this response is that at least from my perspective greater distance makes things worse not better from that perspective saying well it was well well before the agent was born long long before just seems to be digging the compatibilist deeper and deeper
4784976 what is troubling about the design scenario is that the designing occurred before the agent was born before the agent could do any creative work the choices the agent would make didnt
4784977 this difference in intentionality at the distal point of initiation makes no difference to the moral responsibility of the respective agents as far as i can see

4784986 i think thats an event i can do well in and probably who could stay up the longest just so you know thats supposed to be funny
4784987 anything can be drawn so any sort of situation or alien or creature or you know that can all be put down on the page where we could not have done it at the time with the technology available to us that was why the animated series had pluses even though it was stories that were shorter in length simpler stories really basically one main plotline and maybe a possible small subplot but we could do anything because you could draw it
4784988 i think we always geared our stories to the human element we were always telling stories for people to enjoy gene roddenberry always used to say if youre not writing for other human beings who are you writing for so we always kept that in mind but the fact is that for instance in the animated series and in the comic book you can go underwater to an underwater world and you can have all sorts of creatures and aliens in the animated series we had larry nivens kzinti the big cats and thats the sort of thing that could easily be done with drawings but not be as easily done with the technology we had today you could do it but then we could not

4784996 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4784997 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4784998 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4785002 but the first mission of more or less any rockstar game is very easy and engaging for a reason because new people playing the game have to be gently led into the world of 3d action games or open world racing games or whatever this is the way we try to cater for a mass market

4785011 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4785038 during the hostilities weve seen no significant changes in routing

4785053 we didnt get off to a great start with them scoring early in the game but they are a great side
4785054 but once we got a grip of the game we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves
4785055 arsenal were flowing and we had a few problems down the right side and they capitalised on that but once we sorted out the problems we performed a lot better
4785056 there are a lot of positives to take from the game we dont go away hammered and go away believing we can compete in this league but there is plenty to work to do
4785057 credit to my players we showed we had a threat
4785058 we did not take a hammering and could have nicked one and we have got to take the positives from the match
4785059 if you look at what ive done since the gaffer came to the club hes been an inspiration to me
4785060 im enjoying my work with him and i think hes making me improve as a player and hopefully i can keep doing that
4785061 hes shown a lot of belief in me and thats really important even if ive had bad games hes still played me he knows what players can do and he knows what i can do
4785062 hopefully i can keep producing for him week in and week out thats my aim this season to do it week in week out
4785063 i think my game has definitely improved over the last year if you look at my performances i think im still improving as a player and ive got a lot more to achieve im not at my peak yet
4785064 im only 21 and i dont think anyones at their peak at that age hopefully over the next four years i can keep improving year by year
4785065 its nice to get my future sorted and to be here for the next four years means a lot hopefully i can keep improving and then i can stay for longer
4785066 the more european games we can play together as a settled side the better hopefully this season we can push on again
4785067 we want a long run in the uefa cup if you look at rangers last season why cant we go all the way to the final hopefully we can get a decent run and were enjoying every minute of it
4785068 adapting has not been a problem a player born in brazil and with big experiences in portugal and spain will not fail in england
4785069 chelsea is a team of stars on the field and in the dressing room so there is no reason for us to fear anybody i am exciting about being in the premier league
4785070 now i cant wait for the season to start and get on with winning silverware
4785071 the thing is ive heard rafa benitez saying keane can play anywhere left side or right side if he plays robbie on the left or right then hes not going to get the best out of him
4785072 to get the best out of robbie is to play him down the centre with torres if benitez does he will get the best out of the partnership
4785073 robbie and torres are both intelligent players torres makes great runs and robbie has played with dimitar berbatov and a lot of players so he knows where to go and where not to go

4785346 justice is getting what you deserve mercy is not getting what you deserve and grace is getting what you absolutely dont deserve
4785347 sometimes grace is having the strength to persevere through the storm sometimes its having the guts to rebuild to take a chance to follow your nose and your heart rather than your head sometimes grace is finding out that your preconceived notions are dead wrong sometimes its being surprised by joy sometimes grace is something you can feel even if you cant see it and sometimes its a bowl of watermelon gazpacho when you were expecting taco bell

4785362 the paradox at the heart of the sabbath is that you must live your life as if you already abide in the eternal because you do but aspire to get there as if your life depends upon it because it does the former is more difficult than the latter because your worries anxieties plans and conventional aspirations trick you into thinking there is another way out and if you believe that you are doing the adversarys heavy lifting for him and giving him his black sabbath rest

4785368 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
4785369 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4785370 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4785371 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4785372 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4785373 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4785374 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4785375 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4785376 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4785377 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4785378 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4785387 what has traditionally happened in this country is that a change in voting equipment happens once in the lifetime of an election official with some election officials it never happens
4785388 were now upwards of almost 60 percent of the country that in the last eight years have changed their voting equipment
4785389 secretary rokita does not intend to take actions that would cost indiana taxpayers tens of millions of dollars to replace voting systems that have not been proven to be defective
4785390 im not that concerned about any of the voting equipment
4785391 the voters would like some assurance that their ballots could be looked at a second time if necessary
4785392 feeling the stress of concern that were not up to speed
4785393 sort of the classic case of the best intentions gone awry
4785394 people heard a ticking noise inside the bag and informed the police malda bomb squad personnel reached the spot and found a bomb fitted with a timer inside it
4785395 we still dont know how powerful the bomb is and have called for experts from kolkata for help for the time being the bomb has been removed from the fair ground and covered with a bomb blanket
4785396 we demand the upa government that they bring in reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in all private educational institutes in the country
4785397 it is unfortunate that the supreme court has exempted higher educational private institutions from implementing quota
4785398 it is necessary for us to ensure that there is a common united struggle of all the oppressed sections in the society to bring in a change in the societal structure
4785399 this is a shameful day for the upa government three political parties belonging to the upa rjd samajwadi party and ram vilas paswans ljp have supported simi today it is clear that simi was behind the blasts this shows that the intentions of the government in fighting terror are suspect
4785400 for the past two years a series of blasts have been organised by terrorists in different parts of the country investigations in these cases have yielded very little due to weak laws we take this opportunity to appeal to the central government to bring about a pota or mcoca like law to fight terror
4785401 when pota was in force bail was nearly impossible to get but in its absence bail is easy

4785406 i think we had the capability to have both riders a bit further up the grid we just missed the best of the conditions to improve further
4785407 also when our guys went out at the end on new development rain tyres the performance wasnt as good as the normal bridgestone wets which have worked superbly all day but of course we have to try all the options
4785408 from this mornings wet session to this afternoons qualifying it was very different because at the start of this afternoon it was much wetter but there was still a lot of grip out there and i managed to get a few reasonably quick laps in and made quite a good time
4785409 i had to come in and make a change which was quite lengthy and when i went back out the conditions had deteriorated so much that i came straight back in
4785410 im in fourth place on the grid and really happy with that and it gives me a good opportunity in whatever conditions tomorrow to get away at the front i hope it is fine and we can have a strong race and fight for another podium
4785411 at the start i was doing really well and thought i could get a good position but i made a mistake and crashed and because of that i missed the best time on the track to go fast before it got too wet
4785412 for sure like everyone else i hope it will be dry because the conditions today were really terrible
4785413 after twenty minutes this afternoon there was too much water and it was impossible to improve the setting of the bike or the time so i am glad i was able to do some good laps at the beginning
4785414 we have to carry out surveillance over a period of time because the person might have good or bad days
4785415 officers followed him from his home to various locations he was receiving the benefit for severe back problems but he was fairly mobile
4785416 if someone reports to us any changes then we would do something about it
4785417 this is someone who is saying they are severely disabled but clearly that was not the case
4785418 he took more than 5 000 of benefits that he was not entitled to that is money that could be going to other people
4785419 from time to time i was better because of the medication i was taking and at other times i was worse i did try to inform them that the situation had changed and that my medical condition kept altering
4785420 perhaps i should have done more to get them to understand that and it was an oversight on my behalf
4785421 i am guilty and i cannot deny that i made those claims i feel really dreadful about it all but it was unintentional suffolk homes
4785422 when the adhan started four employees of the commission came to me and ordered me to go to prayer i told them that i was on my way to perform it before they grabbed me and violently pulled me in front of shoppers to the secluded parking lot of the market they started hitting me brutally as though they wanted to kill me i managed to escape from the parking lot

4785447 la misi n internacional en contr que los principales obst culos para el ejercicio period stico libre en m xico son el crimen organizado que ha generado un clima de terror la co rrupci n la impunidad las agresiones directas por parte de corporaciones policiales y castrenses y la falta de voluntad pol tica federal y estatal para resolver los ataques contra periodistas y para garantizar su seguridad
4785448 con mucha preocupaci n la misi n observ que a pesar de los ndices de violencia contra los comunicadores no existe solidaridad entre los informa dores los medios de comunicaci n y hacia los familiares de los periodistas asesinados o desaparecidos
4785449 la misi n internacional comprob que hay una creciente autocensura en los medios de comunicaci n mexicanos como consecuencia directa de las t cticas de terror que han implementado las mafias y ante la desconfianza que existe sobre el accionar de las autoridades estatales y federales por su falta de respuesta o por su posible vinculaci n con el crimen organizado
4785450 otros de los elementos que inquie taron a la misi n porque alientan la autocensura y limitan a una prensa libre y plural fueron la manipulaci n por parte de los gobiernos estatales y federales del presupuesto destinado a la publicidad oficial con lo que se pretende orientar la informaci n as como la alta concentraci n de medios de comunicaci n en pocas personas o grupos empresariales vinculados a diferentes ramas de la econom a y con sectores con enorme poder pol tico empresarial y religioso

4785463 oregon voters deserve to be heard on this referendum more than enough oregonians signed the petitions for it the people didnt thwart this effort government bureaucracy did that is a dangerous precedent for the future of the democratic process in america
4785464 although regulations on the referendum process implicate the fundamental right to vote the states important interests justify the minimal burden on plaintiffs rights
4785465 no county gave notice to voters with rejected signatures the counties also refused to consider extrinsic evidence presented by voters

4785507 had you asked me and some of my colleagues a few years ago we would have said you would have an ice free arctic ocean anywhere from 2050 2070 to 2100 because this was pretty much what our climate models were forecasting
4785508 but we know were losing the ice a lot faster than any of these projections
4785509 there seems to be some aspects of this big loss that we still dont have a handle on some processes that are missing that we dont have a handle on so every time we look at the problem we keep revising our numbers earlier and earlier
4785510 my view is that 2013 or five years is just too aggressive
4785511 computer projections have consistently shown that as global temperatures rise the sea ice cover will begin to shrink while a number of natural factors have certainly contributed to the overall decline in sea ice the effects of greenhouse warming are now coming through loud and clear
4785512 there is nothing in the data to suggest anything but natural cycles at work as we can see from recent history both the extent and thickness of arctic sea ice is certainly subject to variation
4785513 but it would be a mistake to assume that a brief period during which the arctic is in a thinning cycle is anything more than that a cycle
4785514 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4785515 there is no significant manmade global warming under way and the science on which the computer projections of weather chaos are based is badly flawed
4785516 the constant urgent message is that global warming is happening now and as the arctic ice cap melts the climate disaster is beginning to unfold before our eyes
4785517 the simple meteorological facts are that the melt happens every year
4785518 in the spring and summer some of the ice melts and in the fall and winter it reforms again
4785519 the problem with the naysayer arguments that this is just some natural cycle is that they refuse to understand that climate doesnt just doesnt change by itself
4785520 something has to force it we know whats forcing it
4785521 if they are to dismiss this huge body of evidence that were seeing clearly now in response to higher greenhouse gas concentration they have to come up with another mechanism
4785522 simply dismissing this as a natural cycle is a cop out
4785523 we know why were losing ice because its warming up the arctic like the rest of the globe is warming we always knew that the arctic would be the place that would be really sensitive to change thats where you see it first its just what were seeing its just that the pace of change is catching us by surprise
4785524 have shown the most rapid rates of warming in recent years the impacts of this climate change in the polar regions over the next 100 years will exceed the impacts forecast for many other regions and will produce feedbacks that will have globally significant consequences
4785525 the complexity of response in biological and human systems and the fact that these systems are subject to multiple stressors means that future impacts remain very difficult to predict
4785526 the growing recognition is that losing that ice cover can have impact on weather that extends well beyond the arctic
4785527 this is a line of inquiry that seems to be very much still very much in its infancy
4785528 the changes are happening almost too fast for us to keep up with what some of those implications could be were only just starting to learn
4785529 the rapid loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region

4785618 fizemos uma boa partida mas foi dif cil manter o dom nio e o controle das a es
4785619 o importante foi que estivemos melhores que nos jogos anteriores a equipe cresceu contra a r ssia e hoje jogou melhor
4785620 a r ssia tem mais for a que a pol nia mas a chave est aberta pode mudar e se a pol nia a confus o ser geral
4785621 foi nota cinco na virada e nove no bloqueio podia ter sido um jogo melhor estou com um tempo muito bom de bloqueada foi mais dif cil na virada

4785623 eles jogam muito bem tiveram quatro match points todo jogo um jogo de emo o mas como esse eu nunca tinha passado houve muita dificuldade eles n o erravam quase nada e fizeram um plano de jogo muito bom fecharam o ricardo nas bolas que ele costuma atacar
4785624 confesso que n o acreditava acho que o m rito todo do ricardo porque os pontos fundamentais do segundo set foram dele no bloqueio
4785625 o est dio bonito tudo muito lindo mas o campo impede a pr tica de um futebol de qualidade
4785626 o campo n o nos ajudou mas isso n o problema a cada dificuldade que passamos a gente fica mais unido a gente est aprendendo a sofrer e isso une o grupo
4785627 n o h brigas dentro do grupo j quiseram encerrar esse ciclo v rias vezes mas o nosso ciclo n o acabou oito anos sendo cobrado n o f cil

4785654 theres no way you should be able to eat what michael phelps eats this is not even a normal athlete i would not recommend this kind of diet for even a fit and serious competitor in say a 10km road race this man is in a very very different place to the rest of us hes 6ft 4in and 192lb of pure joy from a female perspective obviously though i probably shouldnt say that

4785657 say hes doing about four miles a session and a couple of sessions a day
4785658 plus his land training id say hes burning maybe 5 000 calories in training and maybe 2 500 simply to sustain himself something like 8 000 a day in all mind you he is a very big bloke i havent looked at his schedules but 12 000 seems a lot
4785659 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4785660 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4785661 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fibre or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4785662 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4785663 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4785664 most have been training since they were children remember and its a very difficult transition to make they have to be very very careful because theyre going to be cutting their level of activity to maybe a fifth and their diet has to change accordingly
4785665 i might design him a similar diet but with a bit more fibre maybe wholegrain pastas and bread its plainly not affecting his performance but many people would be constipated on a diet like that that said we all have different needs the important thing for right now is that what hes eating works hes like a turbo powered engine revved up to maximum speed and thats the only reason hes burning it all up different athletes handle carbohydrates differently hes obviously converting them very very effectively but its not a sustainable diet long term
4785666 look he needs these vast amounts of carbohydrates simply to get through the training sessions let alone compete
4785667 he eats swims and sleeps and thats about it when it comes to carbs hes in burn mode most of us particularly the couch potatoes are in storage mode and it really wouldnt do to be storing what youve just eaten on a regular basis
4785668 the good lesson for the rest of us in all this
4785669 is that if we do increase our level of physical activity we can afford to relax a little with the diet if we go to the gym or exercise regularly we can allow ourselves the odd little treat a lot of people make that mistake they think theyve got to deny themselves everything vaguely sinful its not the case

4785728 the full circumstances of this serious incident are being investigated by a dedicated team of detectives
4785729 the motive of the attack is currently being investigated and at this time they are unclear
4785730 incidents of this nature are very rare in north wales but we are appealing to the general public to give us information to help us apprehend the people responsible for this crime as soon as possible
4785731 he left the muslim church and converted then when his preacher said something he didnt like he left that church our preacher has said plenty of things we didnt agree with and we never left the church
4785732 drill in protected areas do everything to lower the price
4785733 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
4785734 the results of the war are evident even today in both the military and political fields in israel
4785735 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
4785736 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those who accept that washington entangles them in adventures miscalculated wars and dead end confrontation in the end the us administration will abandon them because its interests are above anything else just as they did to their allies in lebanon
4785737 we feel we were a fraction short last year but not much and we want to show we can get these four points that make the difference between us and the winners of the league last year
4785738 we were leading for a long time last season and that was helped by a good start to the season so let us focus on short term targets and then show later on that we have learned from the fact that we dropped off a little
4785739 im stoked with what happened i dont want to fight this people will be bringing it up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win
4785740 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4785741 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4785742 all that is within me cries out to go back to my home on the hudson river
4785743 lack of placeness with both candidates contributes to a sense of their disjointedness their floatingness
4785744 a black man who unlike obama is deeply rooted in america is probably unelectable today his rootedness would be inseparable from his blackness an identity that has to recede far into the background for a black candidate to have a chance

4785747 tres grandes eventos deportivos de trascendencia internacional en el mismo a o
4785748 contribuye a la vertebraci n territorial y en beneficio de la comunitat valenciana en su conjunto
4785749 la cobertura medi tica de los grandes eventos nos facilita la entrada en mercados que por los canales convencionales de promoci n no son tan accesibles como los mercados asi ticos o americanos
4785750 tambi n es una oportunidad para dar a conocer la variedad de recursos que posee la comunitat valenciana
4785751 en determinados mercados la imagen tur stica de la regi n est asociada casi de forma exclusiva al turismo de sol y playa
4785752 los grandes proyectos de ocio suponen un atractivo tur stico en s mismo y generan miles de visitantes al a o a la vez que impulsan y proyectan la imagen de la comunitat valenciana al mundo entero
4785753 vamos a reforzar nuestra posici n de liderazgo como destino tur stico a trav s de los tres grandes eventos que se celebran en la comunitat
4785754 ha sido un evento que ha conseguido una gran proyecci n para la imagen y promoci n de valencia y del conjunto de nuestra comunidad contribuyendo al incremento del n mero de turistas que nos visitan tanto nacionales como extranjeros
4785755 cerca del 20 por ciento de los turistas extranjeros que estuvieron en valencia realizaron visitas a diferentes destinos de las provincias de alicante castell n y valencia
4785756 al igual que sucedi con la america s cup el pasado a o la celebraci n del gran premio de f rmula 1 este verano seg n una primera estimaci n del instituto valenciano de estad stica ive tendr un impacto en valencia que rondar los 140 000 visitantes que presumiblemente gastar n 70 millones de euros durante su estancia en la ciudad
4785757 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings
4785758 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
4785759 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
4785760 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do
4785761 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
4785762 democratic party activists dropped a tougher platform amendment seeking a government run single payer system
4785763 himmelsteins studies published in the new england journal of medicine since 1986 showed that the u s could save as much as 67 billion in administrative costs alone by cutting out the 1 500 private insurers and going to a single government insurer in each state easily enough to pay to cover every uninsured american
4785764 how she asked himmelstein do you defeat the multibillion dollar insurance industry
4785765 declar ed itself united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
4785766 party platforms are a statement of principles that are not binding on the candidates or the next president and they are typically given little attention after they are adopted
4785767 i think we have underestimated the anger in moscow over the increasing nato involvement in russias backyard
4785768 were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital
4785769 the british government has learned that saddam hussein has recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
4785770 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4785771 da things have indeed changed condoleeza phukupalot you yankees have foolishly squandered your military power in iraq and now i can do whatever i want with total impunity
4785772 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
4785773 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4785774 if they have an interest in a stable iraq they will do it anyway
4785775 why did i use the phrase the ugliest of them all to describe the arab decision makers
4785776 for the sake of this they are inclined to comply with the demands and orders of the american master even if this serves his spoiled child israel and even if the price is the blood of thousands of killed injured and displaced lebanese
4785777 i cant believe the vindictiveness of this regime of president mubarak no one can do this except him
4785778 i was the first to write about the possibility of inheritance of power in egypt since then my troubles with the regime havent ended
4785779 like other autocrats with declining legitimacy mubarak is trying to tighten his grip on power his family is grooming 44 year old gamal to succeed his father any real or potential competitors especially ones with charisma and name recognition are to be defamed jailed driven from the country or otherwise eliminated
4785780 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
4785781 we have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails
4785782 if someone had made those doubts clear to me i would not have permitted the reporting to be used in secretary powells speech
4785783 was not just wrong they lied they should have been shot
4785784 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
4785785 were starting our work and im calling everyone back weve got a huge amount of work to engage in
4785786 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
4785787 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars we live in the 21st century after all we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
4785788 reflects the olympic spirit and the value of the games
4785789 for the olympics unfortunately this is not a big deal
4785790 when its individual against individual you probably wrestled against the guy before in the european championships or the world championships
4785791 you dont see him as a russian who invaded your country you see him as a guy who beat me 3 2 last time if it was team sports it would be more volatile but im not worried about beach volleyball what are they going to do say heres sand in your eye
4785792 its a nice idea but really it was safe passage
4785793 if a war was going on they would stop and let athletes and spectators go to olympia then they would fight again when the olympics finished they stopped again and let everyone leave
4785794 our athletes are nervous they are thinking about their families
4785795 but we are together with more passion and feeling maybe athletes can show somehow that you should be fighting only the sports arena we can show all of the world that we want peace
4785796 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4785797 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows
4785798 up to 50 per cent of our new graduates have left over the past five years
4785799 our geometry reconstruction pipeline computes both a volumetric representation of hair position bottom and hair orientation top our algorithm takes as input 16 uniformly images lit with all 150 led lights turned on one such image from each camera 36 864 stripe images with a single line of light projected 768 lines per projector and 3 projectors and 3 648 tracking images with all three projectors turned on one such image every 10 stripe images hair fibers are then grown inside the volume and along the orientation starting from the scalp
4785800 side by side comparisons for various hairstyles for fair comparison the reference photographs were removed from the data set used by our image based rendering method
4785801 the makers of the movie the matrix used digital face replacement to generate realistic images of human faces even though they had no photographs from these angles explained zwicker if you had an infinite number of cameras and light sources there would be no angles views or shots that need to be computer generated but this is totally impractical said zwicker
4785802 instead for each of the hairstyles that received the matrix treatment the researchers captured about 2 500 real world images using 16 cameras 150 light sources and three projectors arranged in a dome setup with all this data the computer scientists determined the physical position and orientation of all visible strands of hair the algorithms then generate complex hair models producing on the order of 100 000 hair strands
4785803 one possible extension of this work making an animated characters hair realistically blow in the wind this is possible because the researchers also developed a way to calculate what individual hair fibers are doing between the hairstyle surface and the scalp they call this finding the hidden geometry of hair
4785804 we accurately capture the shape and appearance of a persons hairstyle we use triangulation and a sweep with planes of light for the geometry multiple projectors and cameras address the challenges raised by the reflectance and intricate geometry of hair we introduce the use of structure tensors to infer the hidden geometry between the hair surface and the scalp our triangulation approach affords substantial accuracy improvement and we are able to measure elaborate hair geometry including complex curls and concavities to reproduce the hair appearance we capture a six dimensional reflectance field we introduce a new reflectance interpolation technique that leverages an analytical reflectance model to alleviate cross fading artifacts caused by linear methods our results closely match the real hairstyles and can be used for animation
4785805 we have described a method to capture both the geometry and the appearance of a persons hairstyle our capture setup and analysis algorithm significantly improve the accuracy of the acquired geometry we have complemented the acquisition with a method to infer the hidden geometry of hair we have also shown the gain brought by incorporating a priori knowledge in the image based rendering as a result we are able to capture real hairstyles with their full complexity
4785806 simple position strategies described in pft1 for fast tournaments can also be applied selectively in slow tournaments
4785807 also require a greater range of tournament skills and strategies to get you to the money

4785852 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4785853 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4785854 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4785855 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4785856 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4785857 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4785858 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4785894 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4785895 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4785896 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4785897 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4785898 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4785899 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4785900 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4785911 os pais que se informam sobre o conte do dado em sala de aula podem aplic lo ao cotidiano da crian a para ajudar na fixa o
4785912 mas n o devem nunca encobrir o pequeno se a tarefa n o foi feita n o podem incentiv lo a inventar desculpas para a professora por exemplo
4785913 a aprendizagem fun o da escola se os pais precisam ensinar crian a tudo o que ela supostamente aprendeu em sala de aula h alguma coisa errada
4785914 a carga hor ria na escola pesada n o deve ser estendida em demasia dentro de casa

4786145 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences there have been universal concern within hte eu the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4786146 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community

4786164 im fr hjahr zu massiven finanzproblemen kommen wird so wie jetzt kann es mit den kreditaufnahmen nicht weitergehen
4786165 im system sind acht millionen versicherte eine insolvenz einer krankenkasse kann sich keine regierung leisten
4786166 dass es da oder dort regionale kooperationen gibt ist bekannt aber man muss eine partei nicht an lokalen personen messen die gesamtkonzeption ist entscheidend mit der fp die aus l n der in eigene krankenkassen separieren will und men schen ausgrenzt braucht man nicht zu verhandeln
4786167 a small town is a place where theres no place to go where you shouldnt
4786168 do you want to spend a day in transit for that hour
4786169 i have built a very strong team at united and we have put the company on a good course with solid liquidity lined up and capacity actions in place and its the right time to pursue the next challenge
4786170 brought significant capability to the role of cfo combining strong business acumen a solid financial background and critical thinking at time when the company was going through a complex restructuring
4786171 from tiltons standpoint brace earned every penny of all the bonuses
4786172 from united there was no one else that critical to its reorganization
4786173 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4786174 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4786175 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4786176 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4786177 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4786178 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4786179 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4786180 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4786181 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4786182 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4786183 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4786184 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4786185 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4786186 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4786187 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4786188 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4786189 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4786190 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4786191 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4786192 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4786193 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4786194 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4786195 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4786196 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4786197 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4786198 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4786199 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4786200 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4786201 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4786202 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4786203 this is a planning took where all things are going
4786204 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4786205 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4786206 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4786207 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4786208 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4786209 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4786210 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4786211 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4786212 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4786213 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4786214 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4786215 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4786216 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4786217 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4786218 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4786219 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4786220 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4786221 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4786222 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4786223 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4786224 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4786225 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4786226 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4786227 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4786228 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4786229 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4786230 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4786231 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4786232 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4786233 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4786234 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4786235 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4786236 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4786237 the healthy man does not torture others generally it is the tortured who turn into torturers
4786238 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4786239 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows
4786240 if you want a preview of what the united states would be like under a president barack obama just look at georgias recent actions georgian president saakashvili like obama is owned by the same british godfather george soros would soross man obama be another dick cheney if he got into office
4786241 the principal conduit between britain and the candidate has been lord malloch brown the junior foreign minister whom obama came to admire when he malloch brown was deputy secretary general of the united nations
4786242 my book and my research was utterly unsustainable on the free market if i hadnt been able to get a grant from george soros and the open society institute there is no way that i could have done the kind of investigative reporting that i needed to do
4786243 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its probably going to set in
4786244 im healthy my leg is a little sore just from the rounds
4786245 silver is silver i once heard an athlete say that his silver tasted like gold
4786246 to me silver is silver bronze is bronze and gold is gold
4786247 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4786248 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4786249 it is solely intended to provide political cover to democrats that are losing more ground by the day on this issue
4786250 if going to areas where malaria is known to be prevalent always seek your doctors advice well in advance and take the usual course of anti malarial medication
4786251 continuing with the mosquito issue although im not sure this is the best place to post this
4786252 mexican immigration definitely stamps passports of all passengers entering from cuba
4786253 sometimes they accept the propina and do not stamp sometimes they refuse and stamp anyway is that what you meant
4786254 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4786255 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4786256 it is solely intended to provide political cover to democrats that are losing more ground by the day on this issue
4786257 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4786258 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4786259 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4786260 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4786263 it was a painful race and my legs hurt a bit it was my last race and i wanted to give it everything getting the gold medal is the cherry on top
4786264 people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4786265 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4786266 if they are sitting down and talking about one aspect of their lives they might as well work out lifestyle clauses as well
4786267 it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4786268 its amazing how many people come in and say i dont know how i am going to broach that with my partner but you have got to talk about wills and death and thats not very nice either
4786269 absolute exhaustion possibly mere hunger and fatigue or hes had a bit too much gin and tonic
4786270 forgive this weakness mr holmes i have been a little overwrought thank you if i might have a bottle of scotch and a side of beef i have no doubt that i should be better
4786271 i came personally mr holmes in order to insure that you would return with me i feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case
4786272 i am quite well again i cannot imagine how i came to be so weak i wish you mr holmes to come to georgia with me by the next train
4786273 my colleague dr watson could tell you that we are very busy at present i am retained in this case of the elvis documents and the abergavenny wardrobe malfunction is coming up for trial only a very important issue could call me from london at present besides it is quite impossible to take the train across the atlantic ocean
4786274 oh that wont be necessary dr pedis i have already tested the dna
4786275 yes i did the analysis yesterday the bigfoot dna reveals that the georgia specimen is closely related to the piltdown man
4786276 gender equality refers to the equal rights responsibilities and opportunities of women and men and girls and boys equality does not mean that women and men will become the same but that womens and mens rights responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female gender equality implies that the interests needs and priorities of both women and men are taken into consideration recognizing the diversity of different groups of women and men gender equality is not a womens issue but should concern and fully engage men as well as women equality between women and men is seen both as a human rights issue and as a precondition for and indicator of sustainable people centered development
4786277 gender equity denotes the equivalence in life outcomes for women and men recognizing their different needs and interests and requiring a redistribution of power and resources gender equity goals are seen as being more political than gender equality goals and are hence generally less accepted in mainstream development agencies
4786278 gender equality denotes women having the same opportunities in life as men including the ability to participate in the public sphere

4786286 when all is said and done the real citadel of strength of any community is in the hearts and minds and desires of those who dwell there
4786287 there were a lot of 80s vibes because we could hear them rehearsing dont you want me bab y
4786288 eighties music is a hell of a lot cooler than 90s music because i wasnt into grunge
4786289 my older sisters were huge influences on what i listened to and thats why i like 80s stuff i love the songwriting of the 80s the smiths the cure they are undeniably great bands but we dont deliberately make our stuff sound 80s
4786290 i love singing and always have but it was so unoriginal so thats why i did designing for such a long time
4786291 dave and i never intended to do music together he would ask me to come in to do backing vocals on songs he had written and i would say no but finally i succumbed its a huge part of my life now
4786292 coming from street theatre background i always approach our gigs as performances
4786293 they are not just a bunch of songs its how you walk on how you walk off what you say in between its how you look
4786294 the idea of launching our album here first was an opportunity we just didnt want to pass up
4786295 it might not be the most sensible thing but it just seemed like the right thing to do
4786296 people would ask what it was like to be in the australian film industry and i would say its like riding a cresting wave
4786297 i had the choice of leaving australia and going to america and working there and i had no desire to not because i felt that i could do better in australia but because i knew that i was part of an emerging industry and i wanted to be a part of that and contribute to it and make sure that it went on
4786298 i enjoyed my experience on mad dog morgan and loved working with dennis and we went on to become good friends
4786299 to a kid who loved movies they had the perfect blend action suspense and horror full of iconographic home grown brands landmarks and accents
4786300 interestingly when i tried to read about these films in borrowed library books on australian cinema i discovered most of the time they were not even listed let alone discussed or critiqued
4786301 i sent him a rough script about what i wanted to do because i heard he liked australian movies from the era but i honestly never expected to hear back from him
4786302 the day after i sent my note i got one back from him saying he would help us get it made
4786303 these are the real stories from the people who were there in the cinematic trenches including the wild trail blazing mavericks who found private finance snubbed their noses at authority made their own rules and in the process introduced the car chase karate kick bmx bike and waterbed to australian cinema
4786304 the films i honour really offended a lot of critics when they were first released
4786305 the festival of light proclaimed many of these films at the time were just government funded pornography
4786306 i ask people to please leave their political correctness in the foyer to crack a tube and settle in for a fast moving journey back to an unjustly forgotten cinematic era
4786307 i cant wait to be married i feel it is long overdue
4786308 looking back at that video clip and that song i just feel like im so far away from it now
4786309 i dont think i would write a song like that very easily now
4786310 one day we had a really quiet clinic so i brought out the guitar and before i knew it there were these kids who had walked up the mountain i asked them to teach me the national anthem
4786311 i visited lots of villages and these little kids had built their own guitars out of tree trunks they dont really sound like anything but they look like guitars it was incredibly inspiring
4786312 the court considering the contradictions and the panch witnesses turning hostile acquitted the accused
4786313 john kendrick president and ceo of academic village foundation filed a complaint after his bid was passed over claiming the process was skewed to favor brasi the local developers over other projects
4786314 is threatening to take the university to court if it doesnt halt construction on the new dorm immediately
4786315 argued that the project which the developer would own and maintain was private giving them greater latitude in awarding the contract but state officials office concluded that the public university created detailed specifications and design concepts for the building and would in all likelihood assume ownership of the property eventually
4786316 presenting an exciting mix of contemporary and new plays in historic downtown lowell
4786317 with youtube content now available on tivo on top of all the movies music videos songs and tv shows that are simply unavailable on cable and satellite tivo subscribers have more choice on their tv sets than any other tv viewers in the world
4786318 i finished first in my class and now im here with my parents aunt and sister getting drunk
4786319 really we dont see any reason why anybody would be surprised
4786320 the tax decisions are not being made by new jersey residents but they still have to pay them
4786321 the report doesnt take into account the fact that this is a densely populated region of the country where services are not inexpensive
4786322 and despite that were reducing state spending were avoiding tax increases to balance the budget and were cutting taxes to the largest degree possible in this kind of an environment
4786323 new jersey has an overall excellent k through 12 school system but the cost per pupil is the highest in the country
4786324 in some respects new jersey residents are getting what they pay for
4786325 basically a surcharge placed on all activity in the region
4786326 once and for all we were finally going to put a gold stake through this monster the regressive nature of the property tax
4786327 i think our states going to have a hold on no 1 for a while
4786328 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4786329 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4786330 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4786331 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4786332 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4786333 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4786334 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4786335 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4786336 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4786337 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4786338 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4786339 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4786340 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4786341 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4786342 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4786343 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4786344 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4786345 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4786346 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4786347 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4786348 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

4786384 the one who is left standing will live as a slave
4786385 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
4786386 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
4786387 if athletics was looking for a defining moment to get the sport back on track after years of doping scandals this was it and the sellout crowd of 91 000 at the birds nest let out a huge cheer realizing it had seen something historic under the olympic flame

4786394 there are dangers because they are not fully machined firearms and there is a risk that they may fire and cause injury and even death
4786395 forensic and ballistics tests showed that these replicas were able to fire with considerable force
4786396 they may work the first time but there is a high risk of them failing possibly exploding and causing death
4786397 we need the public to give us assistance to make sure no one is hurt
4786398 there is a high difference in tensile strength between the replica and a real gun so our officers were frightened to over stress it during the ballistics tests
4786399 we could have ended up with the gun exploding and fragments going everywhere
4786400 it wasnt a risk the officers were willing to take
4786401 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4786402 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4786403 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4786404 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4786405 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4786406 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4786407 i was singing it and a chill just came over me and i knew it was him

4786411 im not just gonna say it all fell off from breastfeeding
4786412 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4786413 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4786414 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4786415 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4786416 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4786417 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4786418 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4786419 i came in here with expectations of riding a personal best
4786420 it feels so great to have exceeded expectations and to be riding for a medal

4786480 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4786481 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows

4786503 we were extremely competitive trying to sign him we offered a major league contract
4786504 we were there doing everything we could to sign the player obviously were very disappointed
4786505 what they told us was we want a major league contract and we want a quote unquote out of the box deal we gave them a major league contract and gave them an out of the box deal
4786506 we were extremely competitive trying to sign him we offered a major league contract
4786507 we were there doing everything we could to sign the player obviously were very disappointed

4786509 this morning he phoned me from the prison and said he had been released
4786510 this shows lukashenko was obliged to make concessions to the west i see this as an important victory for democratic society
4786511 his release will significantly improve the political environment for the election campaign
4786512 i went out i went out at 1 xx but i need to meet alex at 2 but the fucking stupid bus arrived at 1 45 shit i was late again w but just for half hour v then we went to myer n eat mcdonld again w i brought an ice cream to alex for my false xd
4786513 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
4786514 reveal defendant department of justices utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them in the first place
4786515 this was an extraordinary and uniquely successful conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals constitutional rights for which defendant gonzales was legally most responsible
4786516 we have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the departments extraordinarily competitive honors program and summer law intern programs except that it had nothing to do with monica goodling a fact that the evidence will bear out in court
4786517 its like playing russian roulette with four bullets in a six bullet gun
4786518 i am not convinced a state law will increase seat belt usage
4786519 personally i believe you should wear a safety belt in a vehicle however i do not believe a law needs to be written to mandate it for adults
4786520 i do not believe government should interfere in decisions that are best made by women their families and their health care providers
4786521 instead of fixing it the liberal majority in concord led by governor lynch took the opportunity to eliminate it they have now created a situation where girls who are seeking abortion s will come across the border to have abortions
4786522 it was one of the worst decisions that a sitting new hampshire governor has ever made
4786523 and the health and safety of young women must not be jeopardized in those cases
4786524 i think we should continue to look for ways to encourage adult involvement and support where possible in these cases
4786525 dating back to the abolitionist movement we in new hampshire have a long proud history of taking the lead in opposing discrimination
4786526 people in committed relationships should not have to worry about visiting a loved one in a hospital or whether their loved ones will inherit their estate or the many other legal protections so many of us take for granted
4786527 i believe marriage is between a man and a woman
4786528 under the 1996 federal defense of marriage act states do not have to treat a relationship between persons of the same sex as a marriage even if the relationship is considered a marriage in another state
4786529 if the national database is breached and identities are stolen the government should be held liable to make citizens lives whole again
4786530 new hampshire consumers need to be notified in some form whether or not a product contains an electronic device and given the option to ensure that it has been deactivated upon purchase
4786531 we believe that the network of simi was behind the blasts
4786532 today is a big day for the gujarat police who have been able to crack the ahmadabad blasts case
4786533 the 34th peshmerga brigade will leave diyala to join the 15th mountain division within kurdistan
4786534 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4786535 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4786536 it is solely intended to provide political cover to democrats that are losing more ground by the day on this issue
4786537 die l sung des problems liegt ja in wahrheit am tisch das paket kann ohne weiteres am 24 september im nationalrat beschlossen werden

4786542 i am not convinced a state law will increase seat belt usage
4786543 personally i believe you should wear a safety belt in a vehicle however i do not believe a law needs to be written to mandate it for adults
4786544 i do not believe government should interfere in decisions that are best made by women their families and their health care providers
4786545 as to the government regulating abortion i will trust the woman not the government when it comes to reproductive choice no matter what age she is
4786546 instead of fixing the parental notification law the liberal majority in concord led by governor lynch took the opportunity to eliminate it they have now created a situation where girls who are seeking abortion s will come across the border to have abortions it was one of the worst decisions that a sitting new hampshire governor has ever made
4786547 dating back to the abolitionist movement we in new hampshire have a long proud history of taking the lead in opposing discrimination people in committed relationships should not have to worry about visiting a loved one in a hospital or whether their loved ones will inherit their estate or the many other legal protections so many of us take for granted how could any one of us look into the eyes of our neighbors our friends or our loved ones if we continued to deny them these basic legal protections
4786548 as to legalizing gay marriage if such a bill came to my desk as governor i would sign it federal law will eventually recognize these marriages and accord the couples all the tax inheritance and other benefits now available only to male female spouses
4786549 i believe marriage is between a man and a woman under the 1996 federal defense of marriage act states do not have to treat a relationship between persons of the same sex as a marriage even if the relationship is considered a marriage in another state the civil union bill signed into law by governor lynch was poorly written and it gave more rights to same sex couples than heterosexual couples who may be living together
4786550 real id is unfortunately a flawed federal program passed with little public debate and with little input from the states that would be forced to administer it
4786551 if the national database is breached and identities are stolen the government should be held liable to make citizens lives whole again
4786552 it is my hope that congress will regulate rfids to ensure a level playing field and consistency across the nation
4786553 new hampshire consumers need to be notified in some form whether or not a product contains an electronic device and given the option to ensure that it has been deactivated upon purchase

4786559 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it

4786581 carte blanche to lock out employees of their own choosing
4786582 such an approach would allow employers acting under the guise of maintaining business operations to engage in exactly the type of action midwest undertook punishing those who stood with the union and rewarding those who crossed picket lines
4786583 was whether an individual worker had made his or her offer to return as part of the unions action or individually
4786584 prior to the boards decision midwest offered no proof that its operational needs justified the partial lockout
4786585 carte blanche to lock out employees of their choosing without regard to seniority or any other criteria
4786586 such an approach would allow employers acting under the guise of maintaining business operations to engage in exactly the type of action midwest undertook punishing those who stood with the union and rewarding those who crossed picket lines
4786587 create an exception with no limiting principle which would sanction discriminatory conduct by an employer where the employer chooses to announce its position as necessary for business operations without evidence supporting such a need
4786588 the board in this case appears to launch a new approach with no discernable parameters if employers were free to exercise economic penalties selectively against those employees whom they believe economic coercion would be most effective an employer could take discriminatory actions that have traditionally been barred under the boards analysis an employer could choose to lockout only union leaders or only employees it believes voted against a proposed contract this type of discrimination cannot be a legitimate and substantial business justification for a partial lockout
4786589 in a retributive fashion to discourage employees from exercising their section 7 right to strike merely because retribution against strikers may be effective does not make such actions legitimate and substantial
4786590 all of whom the employer believed were not union members

4786600 i expect a january implementation which is hassle free and ought to be uneventful the majority will not have a problem with means testing and for a small minority of high income patients the criteria are very generous so theyll be expected to pay a little bit more but not a lot more it will be well within their affordability level so singaporeans need not worry
4786601 particularly if theres a family history if the doctor says you should do the scope more often then please do so medisave allows for payment the insurance allows for payment so there really shouldnt be financial constraints stopping the patient from coming forward other than inertia or ignorance

4786622 the people before you were destroyed because they let the nobles fo when they stone but applied allahs punishments on the weak by allah if my own daughter faatimah stole i would cut off her hand
4786623 if the benefit for which the law was enacted is continuous then the law is continuous but if it changed due to a chance in circumstances the law must also change
4786624 precedence is given to the general welfare over the individual welfare and to the prevention of greater harm over a small one

4786628 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
4786629 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
4786630 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
4786631 america is in great difficulty and we are experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others
4786632 this is a serious matter that should be thoroughly investigated and we are sending a letter to homeland security secretary michael chertoff asking for an investigation
4786633 while ice is conducting its own internal investigation homeland security has jurisdiction and we want someone with oversight to take a hard look at this
4786634 the conduct of ice agents guards medical staff and other employees
4786635 its clearly a violation of human rights we believe that its a criminal act to deny someone medical care and cause their death like that
4786636 ice may think they can get away with this all around the country but no not in rhode island
4786637 this is our state and ice is not going to torture people here we want our congressional representatives our u s attorney and our state attorney general to be with us in the statement that no criminal outrageous sadistic violence against a human being is permitted in rhode island
4786638 of systematic and routine denial of medical care for people who have preventable documented medical problems
4786639 takes great care to ensure the safety and well being of each of the individuals who come through our detention facilities each year
4786640 specific allegations that have been raised that mr ng was mistreated by officers while in custody of the wyatt detention facility
4786641 came as the direct result of medical care and special diagnostic evaluation recommended by the facilitys medical staff
4786642 will point out the facts that are already available to what happened to mr ng and express concern about the comments that have thus far been made by the wyatt facility
4786643 their rhetoric is really not helpful at all in terms of saying that the state of rhode island should not roll over
4786644 who cares what does it matter we should have never been there in the first place
4786645 if were going to compete in this division for years to come we cant take anything for granted

4786649 when the u s came to iraq to help the people the bad guys see this as an opportunity to kill americans thats all they want to kill americans
4786650 people hate america because they are free there they think that if the u s spreads democracy to iraq you know it could spread to other countries so they try to stop it
4786651 iraqis dont care as much about how is in charge as they do about their actions they want a do er not a talker
4786652 right now the government is fixing everything they fix the electricity the water the sewers the lights the police everything we are just scared that all of this will go away when the u s leaves

4786660 on friday a passenger van packed with explosives blew up at a bus station in balad north of baghdad the balad hospital director qassim hatam al qaisi said nine people were killed and 40 were wounded

4786756 a major issue is russias contention that the region of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future

4786771 but when i hear the stories of people being arrested when they arrive in angola it makes me feel very worried
4786772 we will seek to remove those who have no right to be here last year we removed someone every eight minutes
4786773 however we will not remove someone if they have an application outstanding or they are pursuing an avenue of appeal

4786777 as a parent i am concerned about whats happening when my children are on the street and i know i am not unique in that by any means if young people think they can carry knives and no one is ever going to pick them up carrying a knife then they are more likely to take one out
4786778 whereas if they think when they carry a knife thats going to be detected that may well make a really big difference

4786786 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4786787 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4786788 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4786789 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4786790 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4786791 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4786792 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4786793 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4786794 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4786795 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4786796 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4786797 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4786798 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4786799 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4786800 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4786801 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4786802 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4786803 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4786804 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4786805 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4786806 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4786807 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4786808 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4786809 it offer unlimited disk space and bandwidth and images dont get marked the requirement for this service is that you have a website that its about warhammer and that you mention the service
4786810 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones

4786814 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
4786815 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
4786816 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
4786817 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
4786818 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
4786819 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
4786820 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series
4786821 its been suggested and we are now talking about that in some way i dont know what it will be but we are having a bit of a think about it
4786822 i admire their tone a lot its so beautifully downbeat

4786825 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4786826 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4786827 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4786828 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4786829 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4786830 voices in favor of the maintenance and development of the process of disarmament and real arms control

4786833 it wont hurt any of us to think and take look around

4786836 the situation when one who committed thousands of crimes is characterised as a terrorist and another as a president of a sovereign state is very strange
4786837 voices in favor of the maintenance and development of the process of disarmament and real arms control
4786838 such cooperation alone would be enough to guarantee the stability of our bilateral relations until there is mutual readiness to modernize them substantially
4786839 advancement of the strategic structure of the american system in eastern europe
4786840 it wont hurt any of us to think and take look around
4786841 most of all and the european union agrees with this the first chapter of that agreement would be dedicated to security issues
4786842 the promotional aspects particularly the baseball cards help generate additional awareness before and during the games

4786845 fielding a corps that is marginally financed touring with some questionable equipment and deficiencies in the number of brass players is simply not good enough for us
4786846 a world class drum corps needs to be supported by a world class organization we are on track but we are not there yet
4786847 2008 will be used to get ahead of the game
4786848 we are taking this opportunity to introduce drum corps to a greater number of students this summer at a very low tuition cost we feel that we must find ways to make drum corps more accessible to the young people in our region as such our goal is to significantly reduce tuition fees for the 2009 season

4786857 i found out that im not getting my stimulus check until july this is bullshit

4786860 you who fear the lord trust in him for he is your help and your shield
4786861 we dont have terrorist attacks here we dont have suicide bombers and i think thats what people think of when they think about terrorism
4786862 there is clearly enough activity for us to be very busy in addressing potential threats
4786863 i think there is some possibility of large scale protests people who may have it in their mind to disrupt this convention
4786864 cyanide is a fast acting chemical used in manufacturing metallurgy and pest extermination that when inhaled or ingested prevents the body from processing oxygen it can also be mixed with certain acids to produce extremely lethal cyanide gas according to the department of justice
4786865 investigators have not said why dirie had cyanide or whether he worked in a job that would have involved using it they also have not said how long dirie had been in denver or whether anyone had accompanied him
4786866 points out a blog post from july with a comment by a somali with the same name as the man found dead in denver with a large amount of possible cyanide
4786867 this has all the earmarks of an islamic terrorist planning to release cyanide gas at the democratic national party in denver
4786868 while we may not be privy to the ongoing investigation it seems quite obvious to us that this guy was a terrorist

4786875 i wanted to live deep and suck the marrow of life to drive life into a corner and reduce it to then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience
4786876 two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
4786877 this was a very difficult business decision but one that was necessary in light of the sizable economic challenges facing dci and its member corps
4786878 both dci and espn anticipated continuing the program for 2008 but as operating expenses continue to rise for the corps we are forced to look at the core activities and needs of our organization after exhausting every other option we have decided that it is in the best interests of the member corps to reallocate the tremendous resources dedicated to the television program to sustain other initiatives that will ultimately improve our collective prospects
4786879 although the broadcast is a very significant component in our ability to share our performances with the world our non profit organization simply cant cover the expense of producing and airing the program even with the very generous support of a substantial number of advertisers and corporate partners weve been quite pleased with the viewership of this world class event and are grateful to the number of sponsors who have helped us offset a portion of the production and airtime costs in the end we simply must make a responsible business decision on behalf of the corps

4786887 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4786888 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4786889 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4786890 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4786891 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4786892 sorry but fina decided not to release any timekeeping images to the media
4786893 for the long term health for this game i think that is critical
4786894 ok this month we will focus on altdorf forgot the other ones we can take some other next month
4786895 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4786896 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4786897 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden

4786903 if bigelf did exist in the heyday of elo queen or ziggy stardust era david bowie not only would bigelf be mentioned in the same breath as those acts theyd give em a fucking run for their money
4786904 our genetic codes are from the great ones the great acts and rock groups of the past
4786905 weve been exploring taboo grounds for a long time and the oxygen is really thin up here its a very high mentality and theres very little room for error when you get into those psychedelic and progressive rock categories youre battling some of the greatest shit that ever existed so youre either going to be great or youre going to suck

4786911 i call her lucy because i cant pronounce her name
4786912 her coach jun wei is a friend of mine and lucy has been coming to australia to work on my program
4786913 other international kids have come down but this one has come through and won
4786914 i feel bittersweet i do money is one thing i have to make a living but my heart is with jess i didnt want lucy to win
4786915 es sind jetzt friedenszeiten warum sollten wir br cken in die luft sprengen wenn unsere arbeit im wiederaufbau besteht
4786916 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4786917 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4786918 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4786919 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4786920 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4786921 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4786922 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4786923 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4786924 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4786925 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4786926 if youre so innocent why do so much to make the hearing look so ridiculous and why try to run from proving your innocence

4786931 hes beaten what they say is the best horse in the country so he must be heading that way
4786932 i cant wait to get this horse over ground just the way he relaxes the way he travels the way he can quicken into a race once he gets to a mile and a quarter 2000m hes going to be scary
4786933 we got a little further back than i thought but on the day he was a little too good hell improve a lot on that run im quite happy
4786934 it could have a little bit but you never know
4786935 i thought i had the horse right for a good performance
4786936 my gut feel was that he was going to run well and get beaten
4786937 i need to focus on the cox plate but it was a very exciting first up run
4786938 i was happy with how the race worked out in the oakleigh plate he just travelled up but today there was a patch where he was a touch flat
4786939 after we straightened and balanced i still thought we could come back and beat him and then he just peaked on his run the last little bit this wasnt his grand final the way he raced was like the stayer were hoping he can be this time in
4786940 it was an incredible run hes come back just super
4786941 he was upset and worried but hes glad im with my mum and dad
4786942 i said forget about me and think about yourself think about the race and stay relaxed
4786943 it was a slippery soapy shower and i fell over
4786944 it the cut was gushing but fortunately my parents were just on their way up from downstairs when it happened
4786945 my head is sore and im bruised but its ok theyve put a clip in it at the back of my skull
4786946 hes hoping for the best and hes going to give it his best shot
4786947 i just tell him i love him and good luck and he says im thinking of you all the time
4786948 the most complex i have known in cricket because it is not a matter of fact but of opinion
4786949 i think you will get a good and sympathetic hearing from the cricket fraternity in london but what use is that if the powers that be wont let tours take place
4786950 re the media i agree your remarks there is no doubt the packer protagonists are cleverly using the press for propaganda purposes i see no clear cut solution but i believe the only hope is for you personally to see the executive heads of all these papers privately and explain the position to them and ask for their support in the interests of national cricket and i think it ought to be done well in advance of next summer to bob parish on the subject of bowlers throwing february 1969 but i think it germane to say that throwing has been a recurring evil for nearly 100 years and if modern legislators can devise ways and means of curing this evil once and for all they will do cricket a great service moreover i think it is powerful evidence in support of my view that we would be crazy now to revert to the old situation where we had no definition
4786951 i cant very well answer that i am on channel 9
4786952 they reckon it will be three weeks but im hoping its just two
4786953 were very proud to have held the shield for the last two years three in a row would be pretty special
4786954 but again if we go into games thinking we need to win to take out the minor premiership then i think were focusing on the wrong things
4786955 cuyo titular sataniza y persigue a nuestro l der gom z urrutia s lo por defender la autonom a y libertad sindical exigimos soluci n completa al problema del sindicato minero y que el gobierno federal saque las manos de nuestros asuntos internos nica forma de retirar las huelgas de los mineros de taxco cananea y sombrerete
4786956 nos mantendremos m s fuertes y unidos hasta lograr la victoria ya que en el caso de napole n g mez urrutia no hay delito que perseguir
4786957 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4786958 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4786959 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4786960 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4786961 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4786962 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4786963 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4786964 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4786965 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4786966 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4786967 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4786968 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4786969 i have a lot on my mind that i have to get out of my life
4786970 i figure if im ever gonna do this this is the day to do this
4786971 i am not impugning the integrity of individuals i am just saying that in a society which is so interwoven and has such a small number of people in high office you have just got to ask for help from outside
4786972 this is illustrated by a briefing i have had from the nspcc counsellor working alongside us
4786973 he has received a text message from a victim which he has shown to me to say it is a joke
4786974 my clients and others know far more than has been given to the police already
4786975 i could not work out and am still unable to work out what really did prompt the change of heart and the revision of the advice
4786976 naturally as i was attorney general at the time i would not sit judicially in any case which may be brought in the future involving the maguires
4786977 i do not agree that there is any actual or perceived conflict of interest which prevents me from performing the functions i have which i intend to perform to the best of my ability and with the integrity which the office requires i am absolutely determined that cases of child abuse will be prosecuted where it is right to do so
4786978 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4786979 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4786980 hopefully next week the likes of boogaard heffernan and macallister can rejoin the squad and we can start to get stronger over the coming weeks
4786981 im going to see if i can catch a flight next week to sydney it felt great
4786982 its great to get the monkey off the back i cant remember how it went in i just know it did
4786983 overall we would have been happy to come here with the team that we had on the park and to come away with a point
4786984 its turned out that way but its hard to take after giving away a silly penalty at the end
4786985 we took the wrong options at times especially in the final third
4786986 it was a game i thought we dominated especially with possession
4786987 australia have proven they are hard to beat in australia but the true sign of how far weve really come will be determined by the next two games
4786988 the wallabies dont like people talking about their away record and think that we shouldnt focus on that but the fact is we havent won in south africa since 2000 we havent won in 23 years in auckland the facts are there
4786989 the guys have to accept reality over the last couple of generations we havent aimed up on the road and thats what we really need to do under robbie deans
4786990 we need to turn the corner its going to be a problem until we fix it
4786991 we probably have a lot of scars from past history
4786992 i dont think we play with the same vigour as we do at home and a lot of that is to do with a mental approach
4786993 i have no doubt they go out there thinking they can win but we need to see more fight
4786994 it couldnt be better for racing hopefully it will be another bonecrusher our waverley star thing im just hoping were bonecrusher
4786995 its going to be a long spring this was just a group 2 hell get better
4786996 hes beaten what they say is the best horse today so hes heading there
4786997 if we get all the international players from australia playing twenty20 and possibly a marquee player as well itll definitely be a massive hit for australian cricket
4786998 word on the street is that theyre looking at it imagine playing in front of 50 000 at the g supporting a melbourne franchise
4786999 i dont want to be pigeon holed as a twenty20 player or a one day player
4787000 google has optimized the loading and performance of 3d buildings
4787001 there are a lot of people helping me out as far as volunteers go there are democrats independents so i need a chance to pull all those folks together and move in the right direction

4787009 dar ber scheint hierzulande jedenfalls einigkeit zu bestehen globalisierung demografischer und klimatischer wandel das sind die drei gro en herausforderungen denen wir uns gegenw rtig in old europe gegen bersehen aber wie ist es um die antworten auf die damit aufgeworfenen grundfragen bestellt
4787010 setzen wie sonst will man begr nden dass zum beispiel die forderung nach einem mindestlohn eines der zentralen themen im kommenden spd wahlkampf ist
4787011 globalisierung das ist der eintritt von etwa zwei milliarden arbeitnehmern aus den heranwachsenden weltwirtschaftsm chten china indien russland oder brasilien die bis dato fast abseits der gro en wirtschaftsstr me lebten in die globale erwerbsgesellschaft f r die einen bedeutet dies einen ungeahnten zugewinn an lebenschancen f r uns hei t es sich auf eine ver nderte wirtschaftswelt und auf neue fast t glich erstarkende konkurrenten einzustellen sind wir daf r ger stet wie fast alle wissen m ssten wir vor allem den themen bildung und qualifizierung zuwanderung und integration absolute priorit t geben wer w rde behaupten wollen dass dies derzeit in unseren l ndern geschieht
4787012 demografischer wandel das hei t schlicht dass wir immer weniger und dass diese wenigen immer lter werden unsere geburtenrate geh rt zu den niedrigsten unsere lebenserwartung zu den h chsten auf der welt in rund zehn jahren werden 60 prozent der deutschen lter als 40 jahre alt sein ab 2050 werden wenn wir nichts ndern noch zwei erwerbst tige einen pension r zu finanzieren haben es liegt auf der hand dass unsere sozialen sicherungssysteme auf diese gewaltigen verschiebungen im verh ltnis der generationen zueinander nicht eingerichtet sind dass wir bei einer lebenserwartung von nahezu 80 jahren die n chste generation wird sich den 90 n hern eine l ngere lebensarbeitszeit brauchen als unsere vorg ngergeneration die im durchschnitt eben die 65 erreichte m sste jedem einleuchten
4787013 aber was tut die berliner politik sie f rdert den vorruhestand statt ihn abzuschaffen und zu allem berfluss will die regierungspartei spd auch noch den endg ltig erst in 20 jahren wirksam werdenden beschluss zur erh hung des renteneintrittsalters auf 67 jahre mithilfe aller m glichen sonderregeln kippen
4787014 klimawandel und die notwendigkeit uns von der abh ngigkeit von l und gas in der energieversorgung so schnell wie m glich zu befreien das verlangt auf sicht zu fahren keine energiequelle die uns heute noch zur verf gung steht zu verschlie en und neue energiequellen und effizienzen zu erschlie en und zu entwickeln ohne dabei die kosten nutzen rechnung zu vernachl ssigen damit den verbrauchern nicht die preise und den unternehmen nicht die wettbewerber davonziehen
4787015 ja das ist es und wie die heraufziehenden dunklen wolken der weltwirtschaft anzeigen ist es h chste zeit dem irrsinn ein ende zu bereiten und das steuer herumzurei en aber dazu geh rt der mut zu sagen was ist und danach auch zu handeln lasst uns die hoffnung nicht aufgeben
4787016 estoy orgullosa de pertenecer a las pocas mujeres quienes han podido incursionar en el mundo deportivo pues siempre fue un rea netamente masculina
4787017 ahora somos m s y eso demuestra que la mujer viene empujando fuerte y otro ejemplo es que en el cuadro de medallas del contingente mexicano que fue a china son mujeres las que encabezan las preseas
4787018 foi muito importante vencer esse jogo n s est vamos um pouco nervosos
4787019 es ist ja fast schon pathologisch dass brandstifter den eigens gelegten brand auch l schen wollen
4787020 porsche blockiert eine einigung seit zw lf monaten wenn herr wiedeking seine blockadepolitik nicht aufgibt gibt es auch keine gespr che mehr
4787021 diese position teilt auch mein kollege berthold huber uneingeschr nkt
4787022 wenn porsche sich nicht bewegt und zusagt dass es nderungen in diesen punkten gibt dann wird es keine friedensgipfel geben
4787023 wir drehen uns wegen der starren haltung des porsche vorstands seit zw lf monaten im kreis wir konzentrieren uns jetzt erstmal auf den rechtsweg und den erhalt unseres vw gesetzes

4787264 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4787265 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line

4787267 it feels good to be here to be part of history

4787270 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4787271 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time

4787287 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930

4787315 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master

4787340 a major issue is russias contention that the region of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4787341 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4787342 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations theres no room for debate on this matter
4787343 the disposition of noble dogs is to be gentle with people they know and the opposite with those they dont know how then can the dog be anything other than a lover of learning since it defines whats its own and whats alien

4787359 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4787360 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4787361 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4787362 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4787363 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4787364 when we saw that chopper there was a lot of tears and screaming
4787365 i have always been aware of how dangerous it can be and how vulnerable you can be out there because i think at times im a bit invincible
4787366 but no i would never give up going out climbing or walking
4787367 i was so shocked when i heard from him he just said im safe now im just calling you to say im safe
4787368 we could see the chopper but you cant make contact or get help
4787369 then it goes away and you know it will be night time soon and were stuck here for another night
4787370 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave

4787375 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated

4787394 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
4787395 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
4787396 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
4787397 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
4787398 a strong commitment to agricultural development by both african nations and the international community could lead fairly quickly to a more food secure africa
4787399 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4787400 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4787401 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
4787402 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before

4787407 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was jsut a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
4787408 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4787409 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time
4787410 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
4787411 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
4787412 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
4787413 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
4787414 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
4787415 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
4787416 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
4787417 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
4787418 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
4787419 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
4787420 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
4787421 having beaten the best in the world and going for gold its an incredible scenario

4787440 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4787441 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4787442 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4787443 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4787444 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4787445 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4787446 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4787447 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today

4787453 the greatest way to transition from new york time to umbria time is to go to my favorite butcher ugo here in our little village and order essentially a quarter pound of his prosciutto
4787454 he very very slowly slices this prosciutto artfully beautifully twenty or twenty five minutes later you get your quarter pound of ham but you also have arrived in italy youre on italian time
4787455 all the rooms old and new have these wonderful shutters
4787456 after breakfast you close the shutters and the house keeps quite cool in the evening when the sun dips down behind the mountains and the breeze picks up you reopen them
4787457 thought we were crazy but we had to have that shower
4787458 but there was a lot less to choose from because the building rules are tighter here they really dont let you develop anything
4787459 when we started it was inhabitable but it had a few flaws
4787460 we discovered when we were digging that the old house didnt have proper foundations
4787461 fixing that cost something like 3 000 more so it wasnt a tragedy we came in plus or minus 5 000 on the original budget which i admit is rare
4787462 we used all local handmade terra cotta tiles wherever we used new tiles on the roof and the floors
4787463 for the new exterior stone work the stone all comes from the local san terenziano quarry
4787464 i cant emphasize enough how important staging a home is
4787465 buyers have to be able to see themselves in a property if they cant they move right on
4787466 the most important aspect of staging is editing and reducing clutter buyers will automatically assume that if the house cant hold your stuff it wont hold theirs either
4787467 they must smell well but not like an overwhelming deodorizer that is trying to decoy other smells pets can be a problem there is nothing worse than an a house that smells like dogs except a house that smells like dogs and french vanilla
4787468 of course austin is a dog friendly town so you can leave them if theyre very friendly and wont attack the buyers
4787469 add an element of warmth and natural beauty to any home but its important to not have too many plants because it can overwhelm a buyer and the plants should be in perfect shape if not move em out
4787470 also you want a variety of things on the bookshelf so that you can appeal to as many buyers as possible while i would love a shelf full of books some buyers might be intimidated by it they also make huge generalizations and assumptions like this home isnt for me because i dont like to read makes no sense but it happens all of the time
4787471 have to remember that if they really want to sell their house they have to be as universally appealing to as many buyers as possible
4787472 i once had a seller that refused to take down his hunting trophies including many taxidermied animals
4787473 they were his pride and joy but no one looked at his house the animals even freaked out buyers looking at the photos
4787474 it reminds me of where i grew up on long island

4787485 the most important thing is that i am a christian
4787486 it plays a role in my life by the way im not episcopalian im baptist
4787487 but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
4787488 john mccain is far and away the most consistently anti abortion of all the top contenders
4787489 withhold government funds from health care providers and organizations that dont hire people who refuse to perform abortions or provide certain types of birth control
4787490 this definition would allow health care corporations or individuals to classify many common forms of contraception including the birth control pill emergency contraception and iuds abortions and therefore to refuse to provide contraception to women who need it
4787491 the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation
4787492 i just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on christian principles personally i prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith
4787493 i would probably have to say yes that the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation
4787494 the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation
4787495 what we need to do is amend the constitution so its in gods standards
4787496 compunctions about voting for someone who had cheated on his wife
4787497 es ist etwas sch nes dabei zu sein ich versuche gas zu geben und zu zeigen was ich drauf habe
4787498 cinderella moves with the decor when she is a servant when she becomes a princess she is animated normally
4787499 i have my own domain which has its own email server where i receive all my personal email
4787500 chama a o ant nio esse cabr o que me deve dinheiro filho da puta
4787501 olha filho da puta n o queres chamar mas vou a e vou te matar est s a ouvir cabr o
4787502 queremos llamar la atenci n a la poblaci n para que ante los primeros s ntomas sus hijos sean llevados a las unidades de salud
4787503 lo m s preocupante es la agresividad y la rapidez con que se est n presentando los casos no est n cursando los tiempos normales de las gripes que conocemos sino que observamos que en las primeras horas se comienzan a presentar complicaciones neum nicas
4787504 hes thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range but it depends on how the third movie opens and how desperately they want him back
4787505 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
4787506 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
4787507 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
4787508 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
4787509 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
4787510 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
4787511 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small
4787512 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
4787513 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
4787514 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
4787515 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
4787516 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
4787517 this morning the greatest scientific instrument since galileos telescope has reached another great milestone its 100 000th orbit around the earth
4787518 the entire world is looking forward to the hubble servicing mission in october 2008 when hubble will get new scientific instruments new batteries and new gyroscopes the servicing mission will extend hubbles life and give it a more powerful view of our universe after nasa cancelled the hubble mission in 2004 i asked for a second opinion i promised that if the nasa administrator said a servicing mission was safe i would fight for the funding to get it done and i kept that promise hubble is the telescope that could and its best years are ahead of it
4787519 there are three more boxes than estimated thats extra too
4787520 they are way friendlier and happier than the people at best buy everyone was helpful
4787521 sir i will be tortured with sandpaper and bleach if you dont buy this plasma screen tv

4787525 for the past year ive been working on a volunteer project that has been an endless source of frustration
4787526 frustrating the customer not making sales not being open the hours specified and having non existent management
4787527 do not ever ever ever frequent this excuse of a business
4787528 you have to go into the store to pay for the installation and schedule installer time
4787529 sike but really though i dont have time to be doing this shit up here i need to be cleaning up my own area
4787530 please redecorate me im such a cliche this is so embarrassing
4787531 youd like the number to a phone booth inside a bar
4787532 hi you look like you need someone to talk to
4787533 wow this vagina is driving me insane with dance madness
4787534 fuck you ill put whatever decoration i want on the walls although its creepy and makes no sense
4787535 hey lady look your donkey gets loose and run away down valencia
4787536 do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
4787537 thank you your honor now miss johnson would you kindly tell the court and jury your account of what happened starting from well the beginning would be sufficient
4787538 well i take it this is some kind of special day for you
4787539 well john is taking me out this morning for a little celebration
4787540 i cut myself off as i heard lance mutter something about my good for nothing boyfriend
4787541 what why dont you like john lance what has he ever done to you
4787542 he doesnt smell what a way to judge people by the way they smell
4787543 not in the literal sense i mean somethings fishy about him hes shifty eyed i dont like it
4787544 thats not true and you know it give me a break
4787545 i just dont want you to get hurt by the jerk
4787546 so you left the house angry at your brother lance is that correct
4787547 i came home from being out with john and my mom said that lance had left after i had he said something about taking care of some business about three hours after i got home the police came they told us that lance was dead that he overdosed on drugs they found way more cocaine in his bloodstream than a person could handle
4787548 in some abandoned house where its known that kids have gone there to do drugs
4787549 had lance ever done drugs before that you knew of
4787550 im afraid lance i dont want to fall over and scrape my knee
4787551 come on alex you are such a baby youre seven years old for petes sake riding a bike is awesome youre in complete control of your life trust me and you wont fall if you do ill catch you ok
4787552 yeah this is my kid sister alex she got a new training bra last week shes becoming quite the young lady dont get any ideas guys or ill have to throw down
4787553 even if you dont get back together the guy wasnt worth it if he didnt stay with you hell be missing out on the best girl in the world
4787554 ha ha i sure had you fooled the guy was smart for dumping you while he had the chance all hes missing is a headache
4787555 just forget you saw me climb in here all right i dont smoke it can kill you remember that
4787556 really they have got to do something about that ozone
4787557 what is this heroin you know what this stuff does to you alan
4787558 this can kill too just as easily as that dope you want to die i can pull the trigger right now and blow your head away itll save you a lot of money come on tell me ill do it say the word
4787559 no youre crazy doing drugs is crazy you ruin your life and everyone elses lives around you forever
4787560 no man i dont want to die ill quit with the drugs just leave me alone all right
4787561 oh come on luke you know what i mean i saw what you did to that kid alan you think scaring him is going to work
4787562 scare tactics are not going to make kids stop doing drugs what if you accidentally kill one of them youll go to jail
4787563 what if you come across the wrong person someone who doesnt want to stop someone who pulls out a knife and stabs you or something what are you going to do then they could kill you and you would end up just like lance is that what you want
4787564 i wouldnt end up like lance lance died because of drugs he basically committed suicide i would never do drugs ever you cant stop me from doing this
4787565 well eventually someone will someone will luke and youll end up dead
4787566 stop talking like that you wont and im not going to stop so just quit
4787567 quit it i can make my own decisions and this is what ive decided to do
4787568 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4787569 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4787570 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4787571 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4787572 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4787573 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4787574 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4787575 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4787576 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4787577 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4787578 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4787579 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4787580 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4787581 we havent committed to any change at dc at this point
4787582 the properties into viable movie product in an intelligent way so that we introduce them like planes on a runway they have to be set up the right way and lined up the right way and all take off one at a time and fly safe and fly straight
4787583 for the first time in yuvraaj we have been paired as a romantic lead however i feel awkward besides the audience would feel that the real life girlfriend boyfriend story is being played on the screen
4787584 also i want the audience to give our pair the respect and dignity it deserves
4787585 it is a period film about men and honour it also has comedy
4787586 we are now looking to release yahoo in may 2009 and its okay because my film is perfect for a release during vacation time
4787587 since vishals film kaminay is also for utv motion pictures its no problem meanwhile i have shot other portions with shahid that dont require him to shake a leg
4787588 shahids doctors have advised him to go slow on dancing for a few months he is undergoing physiotherapy now he should be fine in a month or two
4787589 is it cool that i start my review awwww sheeeeeed
4787590 i just tried this yoga studio for the first time and compared to the other couple ive been to this place is awesome
4787591 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4787592 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics

4787606 they cant give me the name of the family that adopted chevy of course but they did contact them on friday and told them what had happened they gave the family my contact information and now i am just waiting hoping they will call me
4787607 i know that legally he belongs to this new family but i think its important that they know he wasnt abandoned or abused he is loved and we searched for him hes a great dog so im not surprised that some other family adopted him so fast but hes our dog and we miss him very much
4787608 i dont know if he just got out or if someone took him out i know he was found at a campground in peachland and thats how he came to be at the kelowna pound before being transferred to the spca
4787609 ill go on record saying it is a failure on the companys part my understanding is when chevys family moved from vancouver they were unable to remember what their password was which they needed to update the contact information on chevys chip the company wouldnt help them
4787610 they wouldnt give me any information about the old owners
4787611 officers attended and located the suspect attempting to leave the property in question
4787612 the 37 year old kelowna man was subsequently arrested for break and enter

4787616 who will monitor the slaughter there should be a humane group present if this method is used sharpshooters have been known to miss will the killing be done in the streets what about passersby and homeless people
4787617 our additional concern with lethal injection is that unskilled people should not attempt it
4787618 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4787619 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4787620 kalau 90 lebih sumber energi kita dikuras oleh pihak asing maka secara rasional berrapa lama negara kita akan mampu bertahan secara ekonomi seberapa bebas keputusan politik yang bisa diambil oleh pemimpinnya dan yang lebih memprihatinkan lagi seberapa mahal harga yang harus dibeli oleh rakyatnya dari harga bbm tdl hingga tarif jalan tol
4787621 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
4787622 however it is possible to change the direction of change by changing immigration rules if the us were to spot a trend of affluent americans taking their assets to another country you can be sure changes would occur that would entice them to stay
4787623 even though its not politcally correct to say i love the usa
4787624 uniformed and plainclothes police are hanging around to keep public order mainly but they are also watching us
4787625 im here making a bit of money on the side

4787637 since alex has gone to new york people can say this or that about him
4787638 but i dont think i ever saw him take a day off in three years for a young player whenever you see veterans out there getting after it it makes a lasting impression
4787639 i told him listen i believe that rookies have to learn a lot of things on their own so im not going be in your hip pocket all year long or telling you what to do
4787640 well sit down after a game after ive gone 0 for 5 two nights in a row and ill be like what the hell am i doing

4787642 if you have any kind of jewish ancestry attached to your name people are going to notice it
4787643 whenever were in new york boston or chicago i always get some kind of question about it
4787644 immediately getting the closest resources to a disaster can mean the difference between life and death
4787645 even though we have a very robust mutual aid system in california the unprecedented number of wildfires in northern california recently showed that even our local state and federal resources can be quickly exhausted
4787646 during the height of the recent fires we were fortunate to have firefighters from as far away as australia and new zealand assisting californians

4787669 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4787670 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4787671 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4787672 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart

4787764 this looks similar to the behavior of factory owners of sponge iron factories in the asansol durgapur belt
4787765 sudhakarda you are an active worker do you think workers are compliant to everything
4787766 listen there is not a single union in any factory in whole gummidipoondi
4787767 but do not think that the workers have no grievances in my factory itself once there was no salary given till the 22nd day of the month in this situation while taking shower on the factory premises i suggested to my fellow workers if we do not get salary tomorrow we will not work as it so happened salary was delivered the day after everyone got salary except the hammer men so although the rest of the factory jobs continued the hammer men refused to work and hence there was no production the owner did not think twice about paying the hammer men that very day so there is no reason to believe that the workers are succumbing to the situation but it is also a fact that workers are getting scared after all most of them are out ofstate workers
4787768 i believe that if things keep going the way it is you can be assured that the workers are going to explode soon but in my opinion nothing much can be achieved in a single factory in order to do that workers from different factories need to unite together i do not know whether this will happen while i am there but know this if it happens you will find me in the forefront

4787775 el costo es un gran problema en general las defensor as p blicas en am rica latina no tenemos mucho apoyo de los gobiernos no hay recursos en brasil por ejemplo solamente en los ltimos a os hemos venido recibiendo m s atenci n de parte del gobierno en este momento el mayor obst culo es se
4787776 no s cu nto puede costar presentar un caso ante la corte hay traslados hospedajes tr mites y hay casos que demoran un tiempo adem s para las pruebas se necesita contratar peritos tanto de la parte actora como del estado en un caso sobre supuesta violaci n a la libertad de prensa en panam por ejemplo se contrataron dos peritos
4787777 en nuestro caso particular hasta ahora no se ha tenido una experiencia ante la corte porque llegar a esa instancia implica muchos recursos econ micos y generalmente nuestros patrocinados carecen de ellos y dependemos de organismos que puedan ayudar
4787778 la principal dificultad es el conocimiento nosotros hemos sido formados para litigar m s bien a nivel interno y carecemos de entrenamiento para acceder a los organismos internacionales
4787779 el estado no es nuestro enemigo esta audiencia m s all de las connotaciones jur dicas debe tener un car cter pedag gico en el sentido de que el fallo permita contribuir al fortalecimiento de la democracia boliviana
4787780 democracia no es s lo elegir autoridades mediante el voto es tambi n vivir en el contexto del respeto a los derechos humanos y que todo lo que quede pendiente venga de la dictadura o no no se quede en la impunidad queremos sentar un precedente para que nunca m s en bolivia un gobierno sea civil o militar detenga ilegalmente torture y haga desaparecer gente se trata de ir creando una cultura de derechos humanos
4787781 la corte ejerce una influencia muy importante en materia de derechos humanos ha liderado un proceso que ha llevado paulatinamente a que la gente ubique la importancia del tribunal
4787782 es netamente positiva por las recomendaciones que realiza y porque los estados contratantes aceptan esas recomendaciones y las cumplen
4787783 a pesar de no tener una estructura suficiente para dar cabida a todos los procesos el tribunal ha tenido resultados importantes
4787784 se cre una nueva ley que da m s protecci n a las mujeres v ctimas de violencia en el hogar ahora los delitos cometidos contra las mujeres son considerados mucho m s graves que antes
4787785 esto es muy significativo porque deriv de un proceso tratado en la corte la mujer fue agredida por el marido y hubo dos tentativas de homicidio pero la justicia brasile a no lo conden por m s de 20 a os el caso fue llevado a la corte y antes de que sta dictara sentencia brasil lleg a un acuerdo con el tribunal y se comprometi a indemnizar a la v ctima y cambiar la legislaci n
4787786 en sus 25 a os de gesti n la corte emiti 180 sentencias y la mitad de stas en los ltimos cuatro a os
4787787 tiene casos pendientes de 2007 el atraso no existe como tal hoy en d a podemos considerar que un a o es poco en los ltimos cuatro se han dado la mayor parte de las sentencias lo cual habla de que esta integraci n se ha preocupado por ir resolviendo los casos con la mayor celeridad posible
4787788 algo que siempre me ha llamado la atenci n sobre el acceso a la corte es el largo tiempo que se tardan en tomar una decisi n han tardado a veces m s de 15 20 a os yo s que eso depende de las particularidades de cada caso sin embargo entiendo que una justicia retrasada es la consolidaci n de una injusticia

4787832 it was very much a helping role where you could get out and actually help people that were having problems that needed some kind of assistance
4787833 some of them needed protection some of them needed guidance some of them obviously were dangerous people that needed to be taken off the streets to make the community safer i found it very rewarding and i liked the day to day contact with people in a helping role
4787834 quite frequently gridley and the south county are underrepresented in many areas in butte county
4787835 its important to try to keep us involved and get as many services as we can for the area
4787836 we also work with many of the allied agencies in preventative efforts to keep minors out of the system to try to come up with programs and so forth to keep kids out of trouble if we can
4787837 and that was one of the things that i was able to do with the police department here was to start an informal probation kids that committed crimes of a nonviolent nature and first offenders rather than entering them into the county wide system and sending them to court we handle it locally
4787838 we dont have any authority to make any changes but we can make recommendations back to the agencies or back to the county or the presiding judge
4787839 sometimes you talk to people on the radio but never seen them

4787842 i know theres evil in the world but im having a hard time understanding what happened here

4787848 a very fruitful meeting barl had finally been able to make the concerned authorities understand the significance of ham operators in a country with frequent natural disasters like floods and cyclones
4787849 almost all the senior officials engineers and technical experts of the authorities
4787850 promote ham radio as a scientific hobby in the country
4787851 to me it is difficult to describe the fascination of it i know i use it all the time how does it happen cant see the fella there are no wires going from here to there but you can talk to him it was a phenomenon that interested me from the beginning i presume that it is safe to say ive never gotten over it
4787852 public service is one of the primary reasons for our existence
4787853 its also a personal challenge its an educational opportunity to learn more about telecommunications and radio communications its a grand hobby
4787854 if disaster happens and you never know when it might happen were prepared
4787855 they recognized that they had limitations to their communication system and we realized we could fill that need
4787856 they keep track of all the runners for us the runners crews appreciate that but its also been very good for our patrollers to watch how they operate
4787857 were so pleased to have ham radio operators that are so excited about the race
4787858 if you want to get on the radio and chat you can but what appealed to me was being able to provide emergency communications
4787859 its an interesting hobby because you can just sit down and see whats out there
4787860 what hes pretty much saying is im looking for anybody to talk to whos participating in field day
4787861 were giving our station call sign which is k2rf and all were doing is collecting their location and information
4787862 in real emergencies this kind of signal gets through better than voices
4787863 its called a beam antenna and we use it to choose what direction the signal is being sent
4787864 in an emergency you could have that antenna up in five minutes

4787869 if the crescent is not visible because of the clouds count to 30 days
4787870 the beginning of arab months is it licit to determine it using astronomical calculations
4787871 the number of months in the sight of allah is twelve in a year so ordained by him the day he created the heavens and the earth of them four are sacred that is the straight usage so wrong not yourselves therein and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together but know that allah is with those who restrain themselves
4787872 verily the transposing of a prohibited month is an addition to unbelief the unbelievers are led to wrong thereby for they make it lawful one year and forbidden another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by allah and make such forbidden ones lawful the evil of their course seems pleasing to them but allah guideth not those who reject faith
4787873 there was no power in ocean grove no telephones and they were unable to get mutual aid
4787874 the rescue mission included calling the medical reserve corps setting up cots for the injured in somerset and getting the national guard in to access the situation
4787875 it was a very worthwhile exercise and you can never have too many of them
4787876 this drill was a combined effort between swansea somerset and fall river in order to attempt to rebuild the infrastructure as quickly as possible
4787877 they never got the kansas out of him thank goodness
4787878 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
4787879 more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
4787880 theres no question that the geolocation technology that was tested is reliable
4787881 but on the sensing side it didnt always detect usable and unusable channels in different areas these results reflected what we saw in the lab under certain conditions
4787882 taken together these protection mechanisms remain technically unimpeachable whether or not the commissions current testing process produces adequate data to validate a spectrum sensing only approach
4787883 moreover no wsd white space device will or should come to market unless the fcc can verify that the device does not interfere with tv or wireless microphone signals
4787884 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they were recipients of the judgment of god for that

4787943 the times we did this morning with the softer tires were a bit slower than in qualifying so i think we made the right decision to qualify and race with the mediums on the front
4787944 i had a clear lap to qualify and was on the limit with the car all in all at the best we maybe could have done one position better on the grid we are less than two seconds off on a two minute lap which is not a bad result at all
4787945 qualifying went quite well we made a few changes after the third practice to have a bit more oversteer and it certainly was a step in the right direction the car actually feels pretty good i tried to push as hard as possible but would have loved to break to two minute barrier in the last races we finished twice in a row on the podium and i would be very happy if we could repeat that tomorrow
4787946 i am very pleased with our results and progress so far our times in all the free practice sessions are closer to the competition than at previous races and the engine modification are working quite well and give a good perspective for future races
4787947 if we can produce competitive times in the race tomorrow and if we stay out of trouble i think we can compete for a third position
4787948 so red mx 8b is a little more blue than red mx 5b

4788155 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
4788156 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
4788157 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
4788158 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
4788159 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
4788160 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
4788161 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
4788162 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
4788163 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
4788164 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
4788165 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small
4788166 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
4788167 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
4788168 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
4788169 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
4788170 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
4788171 i really thought that cost me the race but it happened to be the direct opposite
4788172 if i would have glided i would have ended up being way too long trying to just take sort of a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first it turned out to be in my favor
4788173 this morning the greatest scientific instrument since galileos telescope has reached another great milestone its 100 000th orbit around the earth
4788174 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
4788175 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
4788176 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
4788177 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
4788178 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
4788179 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
4788180 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
4788181 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
4788182 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
4788183 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
4788184 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
4788185 has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4788186 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4788270 certain politicians are asserting that russia is massively distributing its passports to sevastopol residents
4788271 we will send queries to the corresponding special services in order to clarify how many people have on the territory of ukraine have dual citizenship
4788272 the threat of the application of the south ossetian and kosovo scenarios in ukraine also comes from the side of romania

4788283 and i hope it will continue to build trust between the two groups anything that can contribute to a better relationship between the police department and the community is a good thing
4788284 all were looking for is additional information as it relates to what actions the three police officers took in their response to nizah morris that morning
4788285 were in no way trying to conduct a criminal investigation into the murder of nizah morris were not doing that
4788286 i think any cell phone records in particular will help clear up suspicions or confusion surrounding the actions of police that morning
4788287 we can at least ask the d a for information concerning these additional transmissions
4788288 i dont know that the d a s office possesses that information but we can at least try
4788289 i think theres a good possibility that well be able to get at least the information that were looking for and to review that in connection with the actions taken by the officers that morning
4788290 thats the real focus on what were trying to do
4788291 the disappearance of nizah morris official homicide file causes deep consternation among so many community members
4788292 anything the pac can do to shine a light on this murky case will only serve to improve relations between the community police and the d a s office

4788307 there are shortages of workers in many professions and trades these broad consultations with stakeholders have provided us with a picture of the most common and acute pressures across the country and how immigration can play a role in addressing them
4788308 our government is committed to helping newcomers and their families succeed when they come to canada their success is our success
4788309 we cant prioritize occupations and professions in demand if there isnt the necessary support and training available to help newcomers begin work in their chosen fields
4788310 we need to ensure that canada continues to balance the needs of our canadian industries in terms of labour shortages and family reunification for our newcomers

4788315 as we all know that during this summit we will be launching the sadc free trade area the appropriate way to celebrate this achievement is to commit ourselves in ensuring its success
4788316 through this important step the citizens of this region would further move towards the attainment of a life free of hunger unemployment free of diseases and underdevelopment
4788317 i have no doubt that the fta has the potential to yield more gain in poverty alleviation but theres a great need for member states to address these challenges urgently for sustainable economic growth in the region
4788318 without sadc our countries would never realise their true economic and developmental potential
4788319 it is therefore important that at all times we become conscious of the fact that whatever we do or dont do we would either swim or sink together
4788320 i trust that this 28th ordinary summit will as in the past concentrate our minds on the primary task facing this region which is to confront poverty and underdevelopment
4788321 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4788322 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done

4788356 computer science a programmers perspective by randal bryant and david ohalloran is a fantastic book about low level computer systems in general it wont teach you basic c i think id still say reading k r and writing some basic data structures in c would help there but the real gap of what you know versus what others do is in the low level stuff including machine representation computer architecture caching isas etc operating systems etc

4788384 is allowing us to compete and win in the global competition for new job creating investment
4788385 this is an important step in our plan to integrate previously outsourced manufacturing into our operation
4788386 we are happy to have found the facility right here in allen county
4788387 certainly challenging national economic trends and those trends have an impact on indiana
4788388 at the same time we are creating new investment at an unprecedented rate
4788389 about half of the jobs that have been promised to this state in the last 3 1 2 years have yet to come on line
4788390 we are doing better than our neighbors in attracting economic investment that will bring jobs over the next couple of years
4788391 how many times do you have to throw water on my face
4788392 im sick and tired of you doing this to me splash
4788393 sorry to break in you guys pero remember zara nates mine too
4788394 uhm i think i should say this to you in private
4788395 see kita mo may ka holding hand siya na iba
4788396 it staggers me to think that there are many who now associate freedom with the normalization of everything formerly regarded as morally repugnant when the truth is were building a world in which the majority will be slaves to every whim and fancy not to mention dark and abhorrent desire the human imagination can conceive thats a form of freedom i can well do without
4788397 your eyes will be open and you will be like god knowing good and evil
4788398 most jews do not like to admit it but our god is lucifer and we are his chosen people lucifer is very much alive
4788399 christianity is essentially preoccupied with the individual salvation of man judaism only contemplates the salvation of the house of israel which alone can permit the salvation of seventy nations of the universe
4788400 the advent of christ was a national catastrophe for the jewish people especially for the leaders
4788401 until then they alone had been the sons of the covenant they had been its sole high priests and beneficiaries
4788402 the irreducible antagonism with which judaism has opposed christianity for 2000 years is the key and mainspring of modern subversion the jew championed reason against the mythical world of the spirit he was the doctor of unbelief all those who were mentally in revolt came to him either secretly or in broad daylight
4788403 i care not what puppet is placed on the throne of england to rule the empire the man who controls britains money supply controls the british empire and i control the british money supply
4788404 to uproot completely the whole religious and moral order of the world which has been brought into existence by christianity this will mean that the foundation and the laws of the new structure of society will be drawn from pure naturalism
4788405 freemasonry is the permanent personification of the revolution it constitutes a sort of society in reverse whose aim is to exercise an occult overlordship upon society as we know it and whose sole raison detre consists of waging war against god and his church
4788406 masonic theology corresponds well enough to that of the kabbala
4788407 but the spirit of freemasonry is that of judaism in its most fundamental beliefs its ideas are judaic its language is judaic its very organization almost is judaic
4788408 sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised when something quite unsuitable looking turns out to be very comfortable i was not surprised it was indeed quite uncomfortable
4788409 we are not going to distribute footage we are not doing these kinds of things everything is good what are you going to do with the footage see what the serbians already saw it is clarified for us beyond any doubt
4788410 if it was up to me i would just drop the protest
4788411 im stoked with what happened im very very happy i dont want to fight this it is a gold medal at stake its a difficult thing to lose but you have to understand i came into this competition with the goal to win a bronze medal i went my best time and did better than bronze i got silver and almost got gold
4788412 berall gibt s lila sachen du musst dringend kleidung einkaufen
4788413 i would have liked silver but id already made my move and there was nothing i could do when kluge went for it
4788414 its not nerve wracking its kind of funny cos youve got loads of energy but youve got to wait for second part to go for the laps you can go for sprints but its that energy youre going to need to get the laps and for the last part of the race
4788415 you have to trickle the energy out when everybody else is on their knees thats when youve got to go
4788416 the last olympics was won with a rider taking four laps and then at the world champs in manchester nobody took any at all so it just depends on how things are going you want big gains not small ones
4788417 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4788418 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4788419 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4788420 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4788421 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4788422 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4788423 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4788424 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4788425 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4788426 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career

4788449 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system

4788492 myself and gary megson sat down and broke it down into four aspects identifying where the players are recruitment which is different because its about actually getting the players to your club training and then finally development
4788493 probably about 70 per cent of the players in the premier league come from the continent but we had no network there

4788514 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
4788515 the argument billionaires bloggers and the battle to remake democratic politics
4788516 in commenting on the war in the caucasus most american analysts have tended to see it as a throwback to the past as a continuation of a centuries old blood feud between russians and georgians or at best as part of the unfinished business of the cold war many have spoken of russias desire to erase the national humiliation it experienced with the collapse of the soviet union 16 years ago or to restore its historic sphere of influence over the lands to its south but the conflict is more about the future than the past it stems from an intense geopolitical contest over the flow of caspian sea energy to markets in the west
4788517 it is true that he has won two reasonably free elections but he has also displayed some autocratic tendencies he sent riot police to crush an opposition protest in tbilisi last november and shuttered an opposition television station

4788525 weve called the bank but they dont want to help us i was a construction worker and the type of work i did is long gone said gramajo
4788526 after 17 years working for the lee county sheriffs office donna tomassoni of lehigh acres has worked about three jobs and began a professional organizing business but has been unemployed since the beginning of the year
4788527 i have sent about 250 resumes since january or february she said

4788529 she is getting some unemployment money and also just got on food stamps
4788530 she is starting to look for jobs in other states but worries about having to sell her home which has been on the market for six months and no one has come to see it
4788531 could the new 3 15 million special assessment at the renaissance in downtown sarasota be a case of no pain no gain the special assessment approved by the renaissances condo board aims to fix once and for all the water intrusion problems at the building
4788532 about 2 7 million will go for the repair costs and the balance for legal and engineering fees associated with the continuing lawsuit against the developer contractor and a host of subcontractors over who is to blame for the leaks
4788533 the average assessment based on square footage is nearly 13 000 payable in six monthly installments beginning july 15
4788534 of course for those who are indeed forced to sell the assessment is not a welcome development as of last week there were about 40 units listed for sale in the renaissance according to the sarasota mls they ranged in price from the 200 000s all the way up to the 900 000s
4788535 one center bayfront unit on the fourth floor had just been put on the market listed for barely a week and already the asking price had dropped from 549 000 to 509 000
4788536 on the opposite end of the spectrum one of the renaissances penthouse units has been sitting on the market for more than 560 days according to the mls the asking price is currently 799 000 down about 200 000 from where it started
4788537 the residents really in a pickle are those who cannot afford to pay the special assessment charges to begin with when youre talking 13 000 or even nine or ten thousand dollars thats a lot of money to come up with especially if youre younger and dont have a large bank account said matt orr an agent who specializes in downtown sarasota
4788538 if they are already underwater or struggling to pay the mortgage this might be something that puts them over the edge orr said
4788539 he said one resident had already called him after receiving her assessment letter she wanted to put her condo on the market looking to get out she said she just couldnt afford that kind of assessment that it didnt make sense financially for her to stay orr said
4788540 a wave of residents putting their condos on the market likely at reduced prices to attract buyers quickly is the last thing the renaissance condo association or the owners intending to wait this out want to see happen
4788541 were going to organize people and tell those looking to sell dont just give it away owen said
4788542 sarasota had been a foreclosure leader mostly because of north port said dennis black a port charlotte real estate consultant
4788543 what were seeing is the housing bubble moving through the court system said sarasota banking consultant tramm hudson
4788544 during the regions historic housing boom home ownership was a way to build wealth how quickly things have changed most area homeowners who jumped on the housing bandwagon during 2005 2006 and 2007 owe more than their homes are worth according to zillow
4788545 fully 76 2 percent of homes bought in 2006 in palm beach broward and miami dade counties are now worth less than the balance on the mortgages the study says in the treasure coast a whopping 80 5 percent of borrowers who bought homes in 2006 are upside down
4788546 selling now nearly guarantees a loss for those who bought during the boom in south florida 29 2 percent of homes sold during the second quarter of this year fetched less than the seller had paid zillow found in the treasure coast 36 2 percent of homes sold in april may and june created a loss for the seller
4788547 im not surprised by that neal taslitz a foreclosure attorney in west palm beach said of zillows numbers
4788548 even cautious borrowers are feeling the squeeze said mortgage banker bill davis head of private funding specialists in palm beach gardens
4788549 davis offers this example say you paid 400 000 for a home in 2006 and made a down payment of 10 percent a hefty sum in those days of loose lending standards today though the home might be worth only 325 000 significantly less than your 360 000 mortgage
4788550 if you want to sell your home youll have to write a check to the lender many homeowners have little choice but to go into foreclosure davis said
4788551 scott agran president of lang realty of boca raton agreed that the market has been in a deep downturn but he predicted that home values will come back strong
4788552 the nucleus of all this is housing said sean snaith an economist at the university of central florida
4788553 many workers who were making good money in real estate and lending have taken lower paying jobs in other industries said tom capolino of staffing firm todays office professionals in west palm beach
4788554 real estate agents and loan officers who were making 80 000 to 90 000 during the boom now are accepting office jobs for 45 000 to 50 000
4788555 theyre settling for administrative assistant positions and clerical positions capolino said
4788556 foreclosure rates continued to escalate across the treasure coast in july according to a realtytrac report
4788557 court filings related to foreclosures totaled 1 524 in volusia and flagler counties in july more than double filings in july 2007
4788558 wow said nancy dance president of the daytona beach area association of realtors
4788559 the cape coral fort myers metro area had a higher foreclosure rate than any other u s metro area during the month of july according to realty trac
4788560 i think its a dire result of the speculators market we went through in 03 and 04 and the refinancing that a lot of people did in 05 gloria tate of raso realty said
4788561 gary tasman executive director of the real estate company cushman amp wakefields southwest florida office blamed the high foreclosure rate on loose credit in the subprime mortgage market in addition to speculators
4788562 we knew there were excesses in the market over the last couple of years this is the end product of lending money to people who werent properly qualified tasman said
4788563 speculators and other homebuyers now find themselves upside down in their homes thanks to the fall out from the subprime mortgage crisis and sluggish economy
4788564 despite the foreclosure rate cape coral homes are still selling but at much lower prices than during the housing boom in the middle of the decade tate said
4788565 they are selling but for much less the 100 000 home was selling at 200 000 to 250 000 before but thats ok its a market correction tate said

4788586 high oil prices are due to restricted supply booming demand and a weakening dollar there is no hard evidence that speculators are responsible for high oil prices if the price of oil truly were above the level that the fundamentals could support we would see growing inventories of crude but inventory levels show no such pattern

4788653 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights

4788655 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information

4788704 good morning im nancy pelosi speaker of the house of representatives
4788705 it is clear that americas national security and economic leadership demand that we end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil the current energy crisis demonstrates that we need a comprehensive strategy that utilizes our domestic supply and encourages the promotion of clean renewable fuels
4788706 during the past eight years our energy policy has been directed by the two oil men in the white house their failed policy has increased our dependence on foreign oil damaged our economy and left consumers paying record prices at the pump
4788707 republicans in congress continue to follow the bush cheney mccain leadership
4788708 the republican proposal not surprisingly is the same as big oils more public land and more tax breaks
4788709 when it comes to energy as my children would say lets get real
4788710 the republican drill only plan would lower oil prices by only 2 cents a gallon over ten years even texas oilman t boone pickens says this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
4788711 instead releasing some oil from the government stockpile will reduce consumer prices in ten days not ten years this plan has strong bipartisan support
4788712 big oil insists that despite record profits the u s taxpayer must continue to subsidize their drilling this must end
4788713 and nearly 90 million acres of public land are already open for drilling and a bipartisan majority of congress supports telling big oil to use it or lose it before getting more leases
4788714 senator barack obama and congressional democrats support a comprehensive energy plan to invest in clean renewable resources like wind solar and biofuels and promote greater efficiency and conservation
4788715 our plan will reduce the price at the pump within 10 days by releasing oil from the 700 million barrel federal stockpile
4788716 it will expand drilling in the alaska oil reserve already designated for drilling
4788717 it will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4788718 it will require big oil to pay the billions of dollars they owe in royalties to invest in clean energy resources
4788719 it will create a federal renewable electricity standard cut mass transit costs for commuters and address the role that undue and excessive speculation plays in driving up the cost of oil
4788720 and it will increase the use of natural gas which is abundant clean and cheap
4788721 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4788722 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4788723 lets work together to seize this critical moment and craft a new energy future of innovation and independence
4788724 this is speaker of the house nancy pelosi thanks for listening
4788725 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4788726 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4788727 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4788728 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4788729 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4788730 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
4788731 reconstructing these frescoes is incredibly complex given the condition of the fragments and the sheer number of fragments
4788732 the computer takes over the laborious parts of the process while leaving the important intuitive decisions to the humans
4788733 the moratorium is an important first step and an opportunity for the local government forest communities and other stakeholders to improve forest governance
4788734 the indonesian government should declare a national moratorium on forest conversion in indonesia to bring a halt to the vicious cycle of peatland drainage forest fires and resulting biodiversity loss due to forest destruction
4788735 the epa is abandoning its mission by rushing a permit out the door for political expedience and ignoring the fact that it will emit massive quantities co2 and other pollutants
4788736 this permit is another example of the rush by the agencys political appointees to hand out gifts to industry before president bush leaves office
4788737 it ignores how emissions from desert rock will threaten air quality and endanger the health of people who live in the four corners region

4788750 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4788751 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows

4788799 we are not ruling out hate crimes we are not ruling out terror we are looking into whether the person was despondent
4788800 was no indication at this time that this is terrorists
4788801 its staring you in the face that any regular person can see that this should be considered a suspected incident of terrorism as defined by common sense as well as defined by the fbis own guidelines
4788802 the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government the civilian population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives
4788803 a terrorist incident is a violent act dangerous to human life in violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state to intimidate or coerce a government the civilian population or any segment thereof
4788804 a suspected terrorist incident is a potential act of terrorism to which responsibility cannot be attributed at the time to a known or suspected terrorist group or individual
4788805 i am baffled by the investigative process because according to my criteria this qualifies as an act of terrorism
4788806 terror is a mindset its like a hate crime do you need two or more people to classify a hate crime
4788807 is it the arrogance of a law enforcement agency or is it stupidity even after sept 11
4788808 we havent ruled anything out thats pretty much been our position since friday
4788809 we dont want to clearly classify this as any type of act until all the facts are gathered at that time well be able to confirm what type of act this was whether it be a hate crime an isolated incident of rage or terrorist act
4788810 what makes a terror attack as such is the deliberate use of violence against civilians which is politically oriented regardless how many people are involved
4788811 on the face of things it was no coincidence that he picked out the el al counter and opened fire indiscriminately at the passengers and staff there
4788812 this indicates that the attack was politically motivated and that puts it into the category of a terrorist act despite what appears to be american effort to calm things down by defining it as a hate crime
4788813 only after the arrest of sheikh omar abdel rahman the ringleader of the cell responsible for the 1993 attack and other members was it decided to conduct another search at the home of nosier
4788814 this is why the definition of a crime is in my opinion an extremely crucial issue and not just a theoretical linguistic debate
4788815 this hemming and hawing about what to call what is clearly an act of terrorism is troubling so is this continuing agonizing over the killers motives which we see in major newspapers
4788816 every time egypt is involved in terrorism there is a reluctance in washington to call a spade a spade
4788817 there may also be a desire to avoid sowing seeds of panic in america just as travel is starting to pick up again so referring to this as an isolated incident may be comforting in the short term but its illusory
4788818 when you attack an airport thats like attacking the justice department its an act of terror committed against a federal institution now that america has declared war on terrorism have we declared war on group terrorism and not individual terrorism or is the war against all terrorism
4788819 im ok with the idea of waiting until the investigation is completed and lets see what it yields
4788820 i know people are upset but theres nothing to be gained to define it instantly
4788821 basically we u s and israel see things eye to eye
4788822 the fbi and the police are doing their best to conduct a thorough investigation its not fair to make any judgments until the investigation is complete
4788823 he told me that the israelis tried to destroy the egyptian nation and the egyptian population by sending prostitutes with aids to egypt
4788824 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
4788825 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
4788826 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
4788827 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
4788828 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
4788829 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
4788830 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
4788831 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
4788832 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
4788833 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
4788834 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
4788835 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
4788836 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
4788837 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
4788838 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
4788839 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

4788901 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4788911 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4788912 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4788913 its just hard for me to do that i just have to decide how far i want to go
4788914 today barack and i were in unity to celebrate a unified democratic party focused on electing him the next president i was proud to stand with him today and i will do whatever i can to help his campaign between now and november
4788915 now that were going to penetrate into wayne county there is a lot more we can do as a provider of psychiatry
4788916 when the decision was made to close riverview among our many concerns was losing psychiatric beds in wayne county and what impact that would have on this vulnerable patient population
4788917 there has been a big backlog of patients in the crisis center at detroit receiving

4788919 could this bill have changed the outcome for yolanda no one knows but i think it will impact other children very positively
4788920 we have been able to work with the legislature on an issue that highlights the crisis in mental health and enact a bill to start to address this
4788921 the governor has been generally supportive of this important legislation but we have not seen the final version and the governor will need to review it

4788928 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4788929 it said that our people die 25 years before people who dont receive our services and the reasons were all smoking related
4788930 it was shocking were a health care agency and we were doing things that are not healthy
4788931 ive done nothing in my career except psychiatry and weve been hesitant to go there with our patients
4788932 one thing that would just break my heart was when people would say to me i didnt smoke until i got here and there was nothing else to do during the time when everyone was out there smoking
4788933 there was concern that going smoke free may discourage people from getting psychiatric treatment and also concern that for people who have very limited rights within the facility this is a thing they choose to do and if theyre there for a long period of time that they are being deprived of something that other people have as a right
4788934 but a ban by itself is cruel you need to provide nicotine substitutes recreation and other structured activities so people are not having something taken away from them
4788935 people who use nicotine have to use more psychotropic medication to receive the same level of benefit as a non smoker
4788936 the problem is that is if they get stable in my facility and go back into the community and begin to smoke again they may not have enough medication
4788937 we have a few more hoops to jump through but my guys now have more of a health conscious focus about leading their lives now
4788938 even the smokers would agree with that and without all the smoking breaks theres a lot more time to engage patients in meaningful activities
4788939 the government bought the theater from ford and used it over the years as a museum and as an office and storage building
4788940 it cannot fail to be one of the most absorbing spots on earth to the student of surgery or medicine
4788941 but to the unscientific mind especially to one still aching with the memories of war it must remain a museum of horrors no the museum is a very interesting but can never be a popular place to visit
4788942 a strange sense of wonder filled dedlow and to the amazement of every one i arose and staggering a little walked across the room on limbs invisible to them or me it was no wonder i staggered for as i briefly reflected my legs had been nine months in the strongest alcohol
4788943 the collection of books specimens and records constituting the army medical museum and library are of national importance
4788944 their destruction would be an irreparable loss not only to the united states but to the world
4788945 preserving the relics and bones or wounds caused by the war at any place in our capital
4788946 they were all buried and covered all over with green grass and hidden from sight forever
4788947 discern ed a hope that germs may be used for inoculation and may protect us from diseases just as vaccination protects against smallpox
4788948 now the first in the world and whose not less admirable collection of military pathology are placed at the disposal of all investigators
4788949 on the morning of june 9 1893 the building was packed with 500 government clerks occupying several floors of jury rigged office space when the interior collapsed according to a washington post account the next day scores were killed and injured and the theaters already altered interior was destroyed
4788950 it is a much more subtle nuanced difficult shadowy set of problems
4788951 when i was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the physical pressures that were on me i named the starting lineup defensive line of the pittsburgh steelers as my squadron mates
4788952 pressed for more useful information i gave the names of the green bay packers offensive line and said they were members of my squadron when asked to identify future targets i simply recited the names of a number of north vietnamese cities that had already been bombed

4788960 multidrug resistant usa300 mrsa infection is especially common among men who have sex with men it might be sexually transmitted in this population
4788961 a drug resistant strain of potentially deadly bacteria has moved beyond the borders of u s hospitals and is being transmitted among gay men during sex researchers said on monday
4788962 but because the bacteria can be spread by more casual contact we are also very concerned about a potential spread of this strain into the general population
4788963 the potential widespread dissemination of multi resistant form of usa300 into the general population is alarming
4788964 methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa is one of these types of bacteria which is now found among athletes military recruits and others in the general population
4788965 hospitals have been dealing with mrsa at least since the 1980s but it wasnt until the mid 1990s that doctors began diagnosing serious mrsa infections in people that never had any contact with a health care system including healthy children athletes and military recruits
4788966 weve seen outbreaks in athletes collegiate athletes and professional football players since staph is acquired primarily by direct human contact anyone with a break in their skin who has a lot of contact with others is potentially at risk
4788967 epidemic feared gays may spread deadly staph infection to general population
4788968 the human body is quite callous in how it handles mistreatment and the perversion of its natural functions
4788969 in recent years our culture has adopted a laissez faire attitude toward sexual deviancy
4788970 well now the dangerous and possibly deadly consequence of what occurs in those bedrooms is spilling over into the general population its not only frightening its infuriating
4788971 these multi drug resistant infections often affect gay men at body sites in which skin to skin contact occurs during sexual activities once this reaches the general population it will be truly unstoppable
4788972 thats why were trying to spread the message of prevention
4788973 no dont do not cry because if you cry im going to cry and i cant afford to cry right now im going to do this because its what ive always wanted because thats what you taught me

4789000 married adults report better health but singles are catching up
4789001 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier
4789002 the never married are relatively immune to any apparent disadvantage associated with the stress of marital dissolution
4789003 the gap between the married and the never married is closing especially for men
4789004 the self rated health status of the never married has improved for all race and gender groups examined and it is more similar to the married for men now than ever before which suggests that encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided in fact getting married increases ones risk for eventual marital dissolution and marital dissolution seems to be worse for self rated health now than at any point in the past three decades
4789005 for years researchers have known that adults who have swapped rings say they are healthier than their never married peers are

4789033 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4789034 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4789035 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4789036 this sports for women is exactly what the disbelievers in the west want

4789041 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4789042 our ability to protect our bottom line through rigorous expense control and effective inventory management was enhanced by good initial customer response to our new brand launches and the effectiveness of our promotional pricing actions

4789049 when you have a situation where you feel that youre doing a lot more than you should be doing i think its a really good idea to start with yourself
4789050 a chance to display personal leadership and a chance to shine
4789051 if you can empower a colleague then theres a lot less chance theyll be knocking on your door again and again
4789052 i think its important to be considerate and empathetic and to put yourself in someones shoes because theres going to be a time where you need that too
4789053 a good way to approach that is to be really clear about whats on your plate and how much you can handle and how much you cant
4789054 younger workers especially sometimes feel like they should be able to handle everything or take on everything because they dont have anything to compare it to but sometimes you have to be courageous and have that conversation with your supervisor
4789055 oftentimes we pick up extra work due to different emotional reasons and part of it may be not being able to say no
4789056 it all comes down to personal boundaries emotional intelligence and performing well and being a good leader at work is about having that balance between fulfilling your role helping others and being a good team player but you have to have balance and you have to trust yourself

4789062 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4789063 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4789064 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4789065 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4789066 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4789067 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4789068 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4789069 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4789070 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it

4789104 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4789105 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4789106 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen

4789108 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4789109 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4789110 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

4789114 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4789115 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4789116 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4789117 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing

4789122 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment

4789130 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4789131 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4789132 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4789133 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4789134 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4789135 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4789136 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4789137 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4789138 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4789139 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4789140 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4789141 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4789142 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

4789144 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4789145 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4789146 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4789147 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4789148 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4789149 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4789150 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4789151 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4789152 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4789153 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4789154 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4789155 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4789156 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4789157 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4789158 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4789159 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4789160 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4789161 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4789162 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4789163 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4789164 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4789165 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4789166 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4789167 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4789168 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4789169 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4789170 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4789171 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4789172 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4789173 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4789174 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4789175 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4789176 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

4789179 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4789180 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4789181 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4789182 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4789183 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4789184 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4789185 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4789186 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4789187 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes

4789193 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4789194 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4789195 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4789196 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4789197 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4789198 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4789199 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4789200 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4789201 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4789202 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4789203 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4789204 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4789205 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4789206 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4789207 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4789208 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4789209 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4789210 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4789211 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4789212 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4789213 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4789214 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4789215 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both

4789218 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4789219 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4789220 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4789221 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4789222 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4789223 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4789224 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4789225 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4789226 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4789227 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4789228 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4789229 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4789230 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4789231 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4789232 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4789233 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4789234 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4789235 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4789236 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4789237 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4789238 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4789239 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4789240 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4789241 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4789242 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4789243 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4789244 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4789245 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4789246 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4789247 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4789248 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4789249 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4789250 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4789251 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4789252 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

4789256 we expect that we will meet and exceed the thresholds required for funding the settlement
4789257 the potential of an indictment can clearly be an incentive for merck to settle civil cases
4789258 the mere potential of an indictment probably wont change too many peoples minds about whether to enter the proposed settlement
4789259 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4789260 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4789261 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4789262 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4789263 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

4789266 fay could be near hurricane strength as it approaches central cuba on sunday
4789267 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4789268 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4789269 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4789270 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4789271 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4789272 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4789273 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4789274 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4789275 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4789276 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4789277 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4789278 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4789279 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4789280 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4789281 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4789282 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4789283 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4789284 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4789285 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4789286 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4789287 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4789288 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4789289 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4789290 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4789291 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4789292 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4789293 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4789294 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4789295 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4789296 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4789297 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4789298 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4789299 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4789300 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4789301 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4789302 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4789303 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4789304 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4789305 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4789306 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4789307 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4789308 how festivity we sound out brooding and delineate the scripture
4789309 on what account accompany we graveyard vote jesus was utter in respect to a ineffectual and that subliminal self lived a sinless promptness

4789311 as our soldiers leave our homes and families and deploy to combat this great city and its proud civilians stand tall and look after our families and our children
4789312 the courage of the american paratrooper has always been steadfast
4789313 today we honor the courage and sacrifice of the paratroopers that served and continue to serve
4789314 it was an honor to be able to stand here today and recognize those who have gone before me
4789315 this is a great opportunity to bring everyone together to recognize the incredible courage and ability of the paratrooper to deploy quickly around the world and play a vital role in securing this nations freedom
4789316 this is like a homecoming for all of us here today a chance for us all to get together and celebrate
4789317 we have been anticipating this day for a long time this is his dream
4789318 how festivity we sound out brooding and delineate the scripture

4789323 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4789324 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4789325 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4789326 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4789327 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4789328 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4789329 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4789330 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4789331 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4789332 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4789333 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4789334 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4789335 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4789336 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4789337 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4789338 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4789339 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4789340 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4789341 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4789342 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4789345 un largissement majeur sur une chelle encore jamais vue de tous les aspects de la vie d mocratique y compris au niveau de comment la police devrait oeuvrer doit faire partie l tape o nous en sommes de tout projet visant un changement radical de la soci t cela devra n cessairement faire partie de notre vision pour le futur ou il ny aura juste pas de socialisme
4789346 mais encore faudrait il sassurer au d part que cela ne se termine pas par la mise en place dune autre structure de plus qui ne serait quun autre cran de fum e de plus dans un environnement d j suffisamment opaque

4789348 ce serait de rendre les autorit s polici res beaucoup plus redevables non seulement devant les autorit s politiques ceux et celles qui d tiennent le pouvoir mais aussi devant lensemble des autres lues cela doit faire partie de la lutte pour tendre encore plus la d mocratie dans notre soci t la population devrait galement tre capable de savoir ce qui se passe au sein de ces forces et dexiger une beaucoup plus grande transparence
4789349 advenant la prise du pouvoir au qu bec par un gouvernement de gauche il faudrait faire cest s r un bon m nage dans tous les services policiers mais d s maintenant on peut au moins commencer par exiger que la d mocratie puisse sappliquer jusqu et y compris au sein des forces de police
4789350 pourquoi faudrait il aussi que tous les policiers soient tout le temps et en toute circonstances arm s dans plusieurs autres pays ce nest pas le cas si on prenait juste la peine de prendre cette tangente on pourrait galement et ce fort probablement viter bien des drames

4789367 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game
4789368 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
4789369 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help
4789370 finally to make fully clear to that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4789371 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery

4789373 its something im aiming for there are a few athletes at these olympics who are 40 plus im 35 now theres no reason why at 39 which is what ill be at the next games i cant do it
4789374 one of my goals has been the commonwealth games and the
4789375 its just about keeping my body fit keeping up my enthusiasm for tennis i think the quality of tennis we are playing is high quality and it shows theres no reason why i cant come back for a sixth olympics
4789376 if you are going to ask me what im going to do in 2012 i dont really know what im going to do next year right now
4789377 as long as both of us are healthy in two years time im pretty sure well be trying to win commonwealth gold the games are at home so it will be very exciting for us
4789378 its too bad because we felt it we felt the chemistry weve been feeling it since we arrived in
4789379 if you guys couldnt see it thats really you know too bad
4789380 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4789381 mavait plu raisonnablement mais cette seconde partie ma litt ralement enthousiasm
4789382 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4789383 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4789384 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4789385 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4789386 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4789387 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4789388 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4789389 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4789390 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4789391 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4789392 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4789393 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4789485 crist makes no appointment more important than that of a supreme court justice and he has every right to demand a larger more diverse pool of nominees
4789486 the tampa bay region has no greater problem than its congested and outdated transportation system for two decades political leaders throughout tampa bay have acknowledged that commuter rail must play a role if the growing region is to maintain its quality of life and diversify and grow its economy yet all the talk and costly studies have failed to drive a single spike into the ground even a rudimentary rail system is at least another decade away thats why tampa mayor pam iorios plan to jump start rail is encouraging

4789518 p nktlichkeit flei und zuverl ssigkeit sind immer noch tugenden die von deutschen gelobt werden

4789531 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
4789532 those who want the government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination

4789534 we came together in june maybe we were a little tired down the stretch
4789535 but hey our dream was to come here its been an amazing experience these two weeks weve been here so far i dont think we can blame ourselves we gave it our best shot today
4789536 obviously before the tournament started we knew angola and china were the two games we had to get
4789537 the other three teams are probably too talented for us and thats the way it played out
4789538 that was really our final today and we just couldnt pull through at the end but i think for the guys its going to be a great experience to play against those guys lebron kobe who to me is the best player in the world
4789539 really theyve got so many weapons theyre fun to watch
4789540 weve just got to make the most of the experience and ive got to help my teammates where i can

4789542 ambos podr n ser afrontados con la venta de las parcelas de mestalla y con los proyectos comerciales que se est n negociando en la actualidad todo ello permitir que el resto de la deuda pueda ser refinanciada a largo plazo
4789543 puedo asegurar que en las pr ximas semanas cerraremos un acuerdo para la venta de todas las parcelas de mestalla que nos reportar unos ingresos superiores a los trescientos millones de euros por el momento tenemos tres ofertas que superan de salida esa cifra
4789544 en cualquiera de los dos casos s lo por este concepto hablar amos de una cifra de ingresos de 350 millones de euros
4789545 a partir de ese momento el valencia iniciar una etapa en la que los ingresos deber n proceder de los derechos televisivos del nuevo estadio y de los patrocinios

4789557 weve got to come out from the beginning we cant come out dead again that cant happen
4789558 theres no question weve been tested in so many ways so far this tournament weve responded i like what im seeing their heart and character
4789559 im very happy rick and lach yelled out if i yell out nobody can hear me
4789560 it did pick us up a little bit today was a must win otherwise we would have pretty much been eliminated
4789561 we had the momentum and we started to lose that momentum
4789562 you dont know how this tournaments going to turn out we definitely needed this game
4789563 while going through our records recently we found that your adsense account has posed a significant risk to our adwords advertisers
4789564 since keeping your account in our publisher network may financially damage our advertisers in the future weve decided to disable your account
4789565 ive been doing my best to filter these out through googles adsense interface
4789566 but there were so many of them from so many different domains it was really hard to keep up with blocking them it felt like i was going in every other day and blocking more and more sites
4789567 google said that it wasnt a complaint from scientology or any other organization that got enturbulation orgs adsense account shut down
4789568 some members of the forum wrongly believed that by clicking the ads repeatedly that scientology would be forced to fund the enturbulation website when all it did was alert the automated system of possible fraud
4789569 google isnt doing a good job of looking out for its adsense customers they arent saying we shouldnt be showing these sorts of ads on these sorts of sites
4789570 and then from where im sitting scientology is taking advantage of this telling google that by serving ads onto our site its causing financial damage
4789571 so google goes and shuts us down in my opinion theyre putting a band aid on a much bigger problem
4789572 los disturbios tuvieron un impacto negativo en las operaciones de la l nea de ferrocarril qinghai tibet
4789573 when we were in a fighting phase of the peacekeeping operation yes bridges were our objectives and weve shared this information because this way we could block troop movements and reinforcements thats a common military practice but now when we are in peace time why should we be blowing up bridges when we will have to restore them afterwards we are already working hard restoring things so i think it is just another unverified statement we are not conducting bombardments because we are now involved in humanitarian activity along with the peacekeeping one i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
4789574 we are trying to coordinate with anyone on the ground and at all levels
4789575 its the beginning of a process and we will have more of a sense of the movement of humanitarian supplies in the coming days
4789576 i may have needed some more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it my hamstring feels good its not bothering me i wasnt too overwhelmed at being at the olympics it was just one of those things maybe i could have used more training or races

4789607 at the present time when all branches of educational work are being advanced and improved one department seems to have been quite forgotten and this is the education and preparation of the young woman for motherhood maternity in these days is often anticipated with dread instead of with the pleasure which should accompany the thought and this is not surprising when one realizes the ignorance of the average young mother as to the proper means of caring for her baby the fact that nervous disases are on the increase is true and why the chief cause is that the word moderation seems to be growing obsolete this is especial true as regards the care and training of infants it is the infant which makes the child and the child the man it is very unusual that a child is not born healthy he is born without habits good or bad simply sent into this world innocent and helplesss his very life dependent upon others and it is the parent whose pleasure it should be to guide this little life from its very first dawn to one of contentment health and happiness there is no reason why the young mother with one or several small children should succumb to her cares become worn out and deny herself all the pleasures which make life worth living a mother owes a duty to herself and to her offspring and this duty is to start from the very beginning with the infants training she should of her own knowledge know what is best for the baby she should be the one who can direct the untutored maid or if she has a trained and experienced nurse be independent even of that valuable person it is not right that a mother should give her infant over to teh care of any nurse no matter how good she may be and allow that person to undertake the entire training and guiding of this most important part of life a right start in life means everything in the development of a healthy wholesome happy life later with the baby use moderation never go to extremes in anything begin by being systematic and punctual have a time and place for everything and see that these rules are adhered to the chief things to be considered as absolutely essential to the well being of the baby are exercise air food cleanliness sleep and clothing one of the first acts on the part of the doctor after a child is born into the world is to administer a smart spanking to him for the reason that in order to live it is necessary for the child to breathe it is absolutely essential that the little lungs should be filled wiht aire and become expanded to the utmost if the spanking does not have the desired effect more effective measures are resorted to such as plunging into alternate hot and cold baths artificial respiration etc but one thing is certain if the baby is to live he must cry as it is only through a good cry that the lungs are expanded as they should be when this is so necessary to life it is not only suelfish but wrong on the part of any parent to object to hearing the baby cry it is only too often that the mother in not wanting her child to cry is simply considering her own nerves humoring herself and wilfully spoiling the child bad tempered stubborn self willed and even delicate children are the result of this over indulgence in infancy the unfairness of this lack of training is shown later when punishment corporeal and otherwise is resorted to to subdue the strong will and naughtiness of the older child he is not ot blame for what you have made him and under these circumstances it is wrong ot punish him it is much easier to make a right start than to wait awhile and then try to correct faults which have already taken deep root this is valuable time lost it is not pleasant for you and is unjust to the child we will first then consider the cry of an infant let the mother not hush his cries by walking or rocking him this is a very bad habit insead of quieting on the contrary it should be a mothers duty to insist that her baby indulges in a certain amount of good healthy crying each day a whining fretful cry is not a beneficial one it must be a good strong hearty cry one during which the baby draws in a deep breath and holds it for a few seconds thus expanding the little lungs to their fullest extent it is this which strengthens and thoughens the lung tissue a child with lungs thus made strong and healthy does not catch cold easily

4789633 i have heard much of the agony of the birth chamber that such agony is the rule rather than the exception generations of suffering women have testified since the dawn of time but i know no more of it then i did before my childs birth from first to last i had no severe pain i have suffered more many a night with tooth ache if i knew i was to have another baby tomorrow it would not worry me in the least as far as the ordeal itself goes i felt nothing but cramp like aches in the back and had it not been for the dreadful stifling heat and several hard and exhaustive attacks of vomiting i would not have minded it much at all dr bascom said he could not understand it he said it was perfectly marvellous in a woman of my age at a first birth and with a child having such a large firm head ever since i knew i was to have a child i persistently took every day a set of exercises recommended in a medical book for pregnant women these exercises were said to affect all the muscles used in partuition making them flexible and elastic perhaps it was because of this i suffered so little personally i have another opinion but i do not tell it to all and sundry a few years ago i read hudsons law of psychic phenomena ever since i have had a strong belief in the power which the subconscious mind can exert over physical functions every night as i was dropping off to sleep and frequently through the day i repeated over and over the command to my subconscious mind make my child strong and healthy in mind and body and make his birth safe and painless for me was safe and almost painless fo rme and whatever he may develop into he is certainly strong and healthy now i believe it was the psychic suggestion which produced my easy time but it may have been the exercises or both or neither it is one of the things that cant be proved believe what we will
4789634 i cuddled him in my arms and tucked him away in his basket and cosied the blankets and down puff about him it is so lovely to make him warm and comfortable and happy the very hardest thing i have to do is sometimes to steel my heart against him when he should be asleep i just have to hold on to myself to keep from rushing to him and i sit there in misery and harrow my soul by thinking what if he were to if anything should happen to him ever i would be haunted to my death by the agonizing thought that i had let him cry his poor wee heart out without consoling him and i see myself lying alone at night thinking of the little creature far away from me in his grave and his little basket empty and the horror is often so great that i fly to him rules and regulations to the contrary not withstanding and catch him up and cuddle him against my breast with his darling head nestled on my shoulder and then the sweet baby smiles and the blue eyes laughing through the tears

4789660 well mycroft holmes had a somewhat eccentric brother who some claimed possessed the greatest deductive mind of all time he operated as a consulting detective agency off of baker street assisted by a dr john watson they achieved a bit of infamy with the doctor publishing obviously fantastical accounts of holmess investigations claiming to be solving crimes that baffled scotland yard
4789661 in all probability most of those stories were simply shameless self promotion a lonely man living in the shadow of his powerful well respected brother that is how it seemed on the surface of things but as we well know there is often more than meets the eye

4789779 certo la maglia dellargentina per me sempre una grande gioia ma arrivarci dopo un bellavvio di stagione un gol ed una vittoria esaltante in coppa uefa mi d ancora maggiore carica e grande fiducia per far bene anche con la mia nazionale
4789780 s complimenti al pocho stiamo facendo bene pur non essendo vicini adesso speriamo che in futuro potremo segnarli insieme i gol per portare il napoli sempre pi in alto
4789781 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4789782 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4789783 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4789784 what i hear are lots of excuses and historically weve allowed too many charter schools to weasel out of the accountability system
4789785 this is not about treating the operators of charter schools well its about treating our students well
4789786 but were a very small campus and were very limited part of the issue is that we attract new teachers we just dont keep them because theyre interested in a higher wage so they move on
4789787 i do think the state should give charters who fail a chance to rebound
4789788 but at some point dissolving them does have to be an option its a tough challenge because many are putting their heart and soul into trying to educate kids but at the end of the day the state has to hold them accountable
4789789 throughout the year we have benchmark tests three times to investigate whether the students understand the curriculum we have been using our data to find out the students who need remedial classes and there is no fee for any tutorial
4789790 a newly established private school may receive voucher funds without accreditation if the school applies for accreditation before accepting students under the program
4789791 if he did this its important that the da brought charges and justice needs to be served
4789792 to see if there are any actions or anything that the board has to do or would contemplate doing
4789793 to me it comes as a surprise especially what im hearing in regards to the issues
4789794 we have to tackle it and try to make an informed decision
4789795 i talked to victor about it this morning i think theyre more interested in protecting their own positions than they are in protecting the district
4789796 this is certainly something im going to look at very seriously because one of the things were looking at is the management and how its being operated
4789797 i do think this indictment will have some bearing on the recommendations this oversight committees makes
4789798 i would hope that with this ceos indictment they dont throw the baby out with the bath water
4789799 as a board weve tried to comply with every subpoena request
4789800 weve given the appropriate documents to the district attorneys office as quickly as possible
4789801 we want our girls to be confident and enter fields that are typically male dominated fields
4789802 i thought being with the geek squad it was going to be kind of boring because usually theyre always talking mathematical stuff speaking things we didnt understand
4789803 before i was just saying oh thats interesting how were going to be doing all that stuff
4789804 and now im all like oh i know what that is i know what certain pieces are now
4789805 i was just one of very few female agents and so i went out to recruit more female agents and i couldnt find them anywhere
4789806 there just arent a lot of women going into it
4789807 im in contact with friends that run car sharing companies from austin to vancouver to philadelphia all across north america and we have all seen very strong growth related to gas prices
4789808 and over the last year or two we have been growing from the al gore effect as more people are becoming environmentally aware
4789809 people are saying my lease is up and im just kicking the car habit
4789810 s a drivers could save cash by sharing cars and shaving costs
4789811 some people are just more comfortable seeing somebody face to face
4789812 a person does not settle with fema until they settle with their insurance company
4789813 the man is known to most of the local police he gave a rambling statement about security not being adequate on the guadalupe river and he talked about 9 11

4789817 i think at this point youd have to say the hill gets a lot steeper to climb
4789818 they had their day in court they had their due process of law the same due process that they tried to deprive a person who they shot in the back
4789819 whether the defendants were justified in shooting aldrete davila is an issue no longer in play after the jury verdict that rejected the defendants version of the facts
4789820 i dont have a crystal ball but there are some serious issues that justify re hearing
4789821 it looks increasingly like the presidents the only one constitutionally to be able to do something about it
4789822 i dont know that for a fact its hard to get them to respond to anything regarding these two border patrol agents
4789823 this case is about the rule of law we had to follow the facts where they led
4789824 its going to take us the better part of a month to two months with two people working around the clock to handle opening the letters and counting the checks
4789825 people just dont want to get behind us for some kind of fear because theres so much hate for the border patrol in el paso

4789886 i havent felt good physically but i persevered and did a lot of training to win this gold tenacity was the key
4789887 i was very nervous before the race my heart was pumping i spoke to him about two days ago and told him that i was getting nervous and he said dont worry dad i am going to win this one for you
4789888 my house has been taken over by more than 100 people from inside and outside the community
4789889 they are waving flags beating drums and just making a lot of noise but this is a special moment and to know that a jamaican has done this and i am the father of that jamaican makes me feel special
4789890 i never expected him to break the world record but i am proud of my son
4789891 that was surprising to me i really feel it for asafa because i felt that he should have performed better
4789892 things we must do to show we are the new power on the block
4789893 unless something significantly changes i would say that youre going to be looking at the new front runner for a few years to come and well have to all get smarter and better at how we compete in order to challenge them
4789894 they have a great talent pool and like they have done in many sports they have applied themselves and they will continue to progress so it will be more difficult for other countries in the years to come
4789895 although we have put in a lot of effort development in any event is a process in competitive sports you cannot become a world champion overnight
4789896 for the most part they are hitting the mark almost on everything that they had been tracking over the last two years
4789897 we on the other hand have had some ups and some downs
4789898 they work too much my job was to put an end to that
4789899 i felt stuff in my hamstring plenty of times and still ran this time if i felt something i was going to stop but unfortunately it was too late
4789900 my mechanics werent where i wanted to be he said
4789901 they could have been a little bit better i think i just ran out of time
4789902 id get down a lot and it was tough getting myself back up he said
4789903 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4789904 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4789905 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4789906 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4789907 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4789908 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4789909 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4789910 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4789911 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4789912 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4789913 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4789914 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4789915 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4789916 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4789922 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4789923 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4789924 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4789925 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4789926 es la demostraci n de lo que pasa todos los d as en el territorio nacional

4789928 por qu la propia administraci n se quiere personar cuando tampoco lo ha intentado nunca
4789929 no le hicieron ni una sola prueba aunque hab a sido brutalmente golpeado y pas por varios m dicos diferentes
4789930 aunque neira no hubiera tomado ninguna medicaci n anterior era de colegio el hacer pruebas
4789931 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4789932 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4789933 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4789934 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4789935 synergy anuncia que firm un contrato de un a o con el actor de hollywwod de primera l nea

4789937 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4789938 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4789939 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4789940 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4789941 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4789942 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4789943 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4789944 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4789945 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4789946 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4789947 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4789948 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4789949 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4789950 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4789951 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4789952 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4789953 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4789954 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4789955 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4789956 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4789957 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4789958 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4789959 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4789960 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4789961 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4789962 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4789963 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4789964 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4789965 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4789966 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4789967 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4789968 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4789969 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4789970 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4789971 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4789972 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4789973 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4789974 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4789975 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4789976 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4789977 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4789978 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4789979 who are open to doing something on the production side
4789980 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4789981 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4789982 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4789983 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4789984 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4789985 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4789986 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4789987 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4789988 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4789989 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4789990 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4789991 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4789992 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4789993 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4789994 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4789995 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4789996 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4789997 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4789998 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4789999 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
