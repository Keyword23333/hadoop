6180123 people know where helen clark stands they dont know where john key stands so if this election is about trust were very much back in the running
6180124 trust is an emotion that rises and falls slowly and which morphs into partisan preference slowly too
6180125 first it will be hard for national to turn this trust deficit around within the next three months
6180126 right now national has both a debt problem and a trust problem

6180151 now the soviet union is marching onward the soviet union is moving towards communism
6180152 i was present only as a dumb personage on the platform
6180153 it is not true that the internationale was the creation of karl marx he remained completely outside the preparatory work that took place from 1862 to 1864
6180154 in a letter to his uncle leon phillips marx announced that he had made 400 pounds on the stock exchange
6180155 we must combat religion this is the abcs of all materialism and consequently of marxism
6180156 it is a real comfort to me an old man to be able to step into my grave with the knowledge that the civilization of the world will be saved it is here in russia that i have actually been convinced that the new communist system is capable of leading mankind out of its present crisis and saving it from complete anarchy and ruin
6180157 it is on god himself that the bolshevicks are waging war
6180158 today it is estimated by jacobs grandson john schiff that the old man sank about 20 000 000 for the final triumph of bolshevism in russia
6180159 socialists leaving for the purposes of starting revolution against present russian government
6180160 lenin was sent into russia in the same way that you might send a vial containing a culture of typhoid or of cholera to be poured into the water supply of a great city and it worked with amazing accuracy no sooner did lenin arrive than he began beckoning a finger here and a finger there to obscure persons in sheltered retreats in new york glasgow in berne and other countries and he gathered together the leading spirits of a formidable sect the most formidable sect in the world with these spirits around him he set to work with demoniacal ability to tear to pieces every institution on which the russian state depended
6180161 from the days of spartacus weishaupt to those of karl marx to those of trotsky bela kuhn rosa luxembourg and emma goldman this world wide conspiracy has been steadily growing this conspiracy played a definitely recognizable role in the tragedy of the french revolution it has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the nineteenth century and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of europe and america have gripped the russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire there is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of bolshevism and in the bringing about of the russian revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical jews it is certainly a very great one it probably outweighs all others with the notable exception of lenin the majority of the leading figures are jews
6180162 main purveyors of funds for the revolution however were neither crackpot russian millionaires nor armed bandits on lenin the real money primarily came from certain british and american circles which for a long time past had lent their support to the russian revolutionary cause
6180163 engineered by the english more precisely by sir george buchanan and lord alfred milner of the round table in private conversations i have been told that over 21 million rubles were spent by lord milner in financing the russian revolution
6180164 the state does not function as we desired how does it function the car does not obey a man is at the wheel and seems to lead it but the car does not drive in the desired direction it moves as another force wishes
6180165 i committed a great error my nightmare is to have the feeling that im lost in an ocean of blood from the innumerable victims it is too late to return to save our country russia we would have needed men like francis of assisi with ten men like him we would have saved russia
6180166 after taking over the position of secretary general comrade stalin accumulated in his hands immeasurable power and i am not certain whether he will be always able to use this power with the required care
6180167 stalin is excessively rude and this defect which can be freely tolerated in our midst and in contacts among u s communists becomes a defect which cannot be tolerated in one holding the position of secretary general because of this i propose that the comrades consider the method by which stalin would be removed from this position and by which another man would be selected for it a man who above all would differ from stalin in only one quality namely greater tolerance greater loyalty greater kindness and more considerate attitude toward the comrades a less capricious temper etc
6180168 a bold secret decision to share the results of the manhattan project with the soviet union
6180169 walls five feet thick of lead and water to control flying neutrons
6180170 four months of solid research interviewing experts in the fields of photo optics photo chemistry and electro optics all of whom carefully studied the motion picture film and still photographs officially released by the soviet government indicate them to be double printed the foreground leonov was superimposed on the background earth below the russian film showed reflections from the glass plate under which a double plate is made leonov was suspended from wire or cables in several episodes of the russian film light was reflected from a small portion of wire or cable attached to leonovs space suit one camera angle was impossible of achievement this showed leonov crawling out of his hatch into space it was a head on shot so the camera would have had to have been located out in space beyond the space ship
6180171 to our new common battle we offer all we are and all we have to stand with you until the pacific and the world are freed from the curse of brute force and endless perfidy
6180172 unite and defeat the u s aggressors and all their running dogs
6180173 i would not recognize red china now and i would not agree to admitting it to the united nations
6180174 admitting red china to the united nations would be a mockery of the provision of the charter which limits its membership to peace loving nations and what was most disturbing was that it would give respectability to the communist regime which would immediately increase its power and prestige in asia and probably irreparably weaken the non communist governments in that area
6180175 the thing to do is let south korea fall but not to let it look as if we pushed it
6180176 the united states should disembarrass itself as quickly as possible from its entanglements in south korea
6180177 we felt the action urged by gen macarthur would hazard this safety of the u s without promising any certain proportionate gain
6180178 i would never have made the attack and risked my men and military reputation if i had not been assured that washington would restrain general macarthur from taking adequate retaliatory measures against my lines of supply and communication
6180179 we had sufficient air bombardment fighters reconnaissance so that i could have taken out all those supplies those airdromes on the other side of the yalu i could have bombed the devils between there and mukden stopped the railroad operating and the people of china that were fighting could not have been supplied but we werent permitted to do it as a result a lot of american blood was spilled over there in korea
6180180 i was worried by a series of directives from washington which were greatly decreasing the potential of my air force first i was forbidden hot pursuit of enemy planes that attacked our own manchuria and siberia were sanctuaries of inviolate protection for all enemy forces and for all enemy purposes no matter what depredations or assaults might come from there then i was denied the right to bomb the hydroelectric plants along the yalu river this order was broadened to include every plant in north korea which was capable of furnishing electric power to manchuria and siberia most incomprehensible of all was the refusal to let me bomb the important supply center at racin which was not in manchuria or siberia but many miles from the border where the soviet union forwarded supplies from vladivostok for the north korean army i felt that step by step my weapons were being taken away from me
6180181 that there was some leak in intelligence was evident to everyone brig gen walton walker continually complained to me that operations were known to the enemy in advance through sources in washington information must have been relayed to them assuring that the yalu river bridges would continue to enjoy sanctuary and that their bases would be left intact they knew they could swarm down across the yalu river without having to worry about bombers hitting their manchurian supply lines i realized for the first time that i had actually been denied the use of my full military power to safeguard the lives of my soldiers and the safety of my army
6180182 i am concerned for the security of our great nation not so much because of any threat from without but because of the insidious forces working from within
6180183 the government of the united states does not look with favor upon governments unfriendly to the soviet union on the borders of the soviet union
6180184 in peace as in war yugoslavia must march shoulder to shoulder with the soviet union
6180185 embarrassed by the war they dont like it and they would like to see it stopped
6180186 there is no communism to speak of in fidel castros movement
6180187 the people of the united states have great admiration for you and your men because you are in the real american spirit of george washington
6180188 there was no evidence of any organized communist elements within the castro movement or that senor castro himself was under communist influence
6180189 regularly disregarded sidetracked or denounced fbi state department and military intelligence sources which branded castro as a communist
6180190 individuals in the state department and individuals in the new york times put castro in power
6180191 we must attempt to strengthen the non batista democratic anti castro forces in exile and in cuba itself who offer eventual hope of overthrowing castro
6180192 u s helps train anti castro force at secret guatemalan air ground base
6180193 cuba which was intended to be a showcase of the soviet model of development in america was in fact quickly turning into a showcase of soviet inefficiency mainly due to the cuban leaders inability and the propagation of fidels heretical ideas
6180194 khrushchevs carefully conceived plans had not counted on the unexpected and apparently irrational behavior of president kennedy
6180195 finally soviet developments in cuba were so blatant and political pressures in the u s so strong that kennedy was forced to act but when he announced the blockade of the island he unexpectedly stated that the american actions were not directed against cuba but against the soviet union kennedys behavior was so surprising that khrushchev was caught completely off balance and panicked before the possibility of a nuclear confrontation which he had not anticipated and for which he was not prepared fortunately for the world khrushchev was enough of a political realist to recognize when a gambit had been lost khrushchev never understood why kennedy had acted in such an irrational and foolish way by not attacking cuba and thereby allowing castro to stay in power
6180196 i think we have spawned constructed entirely fabricated without knowing it the castro movement
6180197 castro could not have seized power in cuba without the aid of the united states american government agencies and the united states press played a major role in bringing castro to power the state department consistently intervened to bring about the downfall of batiste thereby making it possible for fidel castro to take over the government of cuba
6180198 the object of soviet communism is victory of communism throughout the world by peace or war
6180199 the white race constitutes about one tenth of the worlds population let us completely annihilate the white man then we shall be free of him once and for all
6180200 i do not know whether it is owing to the anxiety of my mind or what but this afternoon as i was sitting at this table engaged in preparing a dispatch something in the apartment seemed to disturb me looking up i beheld standing opposite me a singularly beautiful being so astonished was i for i had given strict orders not to be disturbed that it was some moments before i had found language to inquire the cause of the visit a second a third and even a fourth time did i repeat my question but received no answer from my mysterious visitor except a slight raising of the eyes by this time i felt strange sensations spreading through me i would have risen but the riveted gaze of the being before me rendered volition impossible i assayed once more to speak but my tongue had become useless as if paralyzed a new influence mysterious potent irresistible took possession of me all i could do was to gaze steadily vacantly at my unknown visitor gradually the surrounding atmosphere seemed to fill with sensations and grew luminous everything about me seemed to rarefy the mysterious visitor also becoming more airy and yet more distinct to my sight than before i began to feel as one dying or rather to experience the sensations which i have sometimes imagined accompany death i did not think i did not reason i did not move all were alike impossible i was only conscious of gazing fixedly vacantly at my companion presently i heard a voice saying son of the republic look and learn while at the same time my visitor extended an arm eastward i now beheld a heavy white vapor at some distance rising fold upon fold this gradually dissipated and i looked upon a strange scene before me lay spread out in one vast plain all the countries of the world europe asia africa and america i saw rolling and tossing between europe and america the billows of the atlantic and between asia and america lay the pacific son of the republic said the same mysterious voice as before look and learn at that moment i beheld a dark shadowy being like an angel standing or rather floating in mid air between europe and america dipping water out of the ocean in the hollow of each hand he sprinkled some upon america with his right hand while with his left he cast some over europe immediately a cloud arose from these countries and joined in mid ocean for awhile it seemed stationary and then it moved slowly westward until it enveloped america in its murky folds sharp flashes of lightning gleamed through it at intervals and i heard the smothered groans and cries of the american people the american revolution which was in progress a second time the angel dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it out as before the dark cloud was then drawn back to the ocean in whose heaving billows it sank from view a third time i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn i cast my eyes upon america and beheld villages and towns and cities springing up one after another until the whole land from the atlantic to the pacific was dotted with them again i heard the mysterious voice say son of the republic the end of the century cometh look and learn and this time the dark shadowy angel turned his face southward from africa i saw an ill omened specter approach our land it flitted slowly and heavily over every town and city of the latter the inhabitants presently set themselves in battle array against each other as i continued looking i saw a bright angel on whose brow rested a crown of light on which was traced the word union he was bearing the american flag he placed the flag between the divided nation and said remember ye are brethren referred to the civil war instantly the inhabitants casting down their weapons became friends once more and united around the national standard again i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn at this the dark shadowy angel placed a trumpet to his mouth and blew three distinct blasts and taking water from the ocean he sprinkled it upon europe asia and africa then my eyes beheld a fearful scene from each of these continents arose thick black clouds that were soon joined into one and throughout this mass there gleamed a dark red light by which i saw hordes of armed men these men moving with the cloud marched by land and sailed by sea to america which country was enveloped in the volume of the cloud and i dimly saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the villages towns and cities which i had seen spring up as my ears listened to the thundering of the cannon clashing of swords and the shouts and cries of millions in mortal combat i again heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn when this voice had ceased the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth and blew a long and fearful blast instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped america at the same moment the angel upon whose head still shown the word union and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits these immediately joined the inhabitants of america who i perceived were well nigh overcome but who immediately taking courage again closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle again amid the fearful noise of the conflict i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn as the voice ceased the shadowy angel for the last time dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon america instantly the dark cloud rolled back together with the armies it had brought leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious then once more i beheld villages towns and cities springing up where i had seen them before while the bright angel planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them cried with a loud voice while the stars remain and the heavens send down dew upon the earth so long shall the union last and taking from his brow the crown on which blazened the word union he placed it upon the standard while the people kneeling down said amen the scene instantly began to fade and dissolve and i at last saw nothing but the rising curling vapor i at first beheld this also disappeared and i found myself once more gazing upon the mysterious visitor who in the same voice i had heard before said son of the republic what you have seen is thus interpreted three great perils will come upon the republic the most fearful for her is the third but the whole world united shall not prevail against her let every child of the republic learn to live for his god his land and union with these words the vision vanished and i started from my seat and felt that i had seen a vision wherein had been shown me the birth the progress and the destiny of the united states
6180201 after sixty years of aggression by the soviets only 17 of the remaining world population lives in what could be termed a free society
6180202 war to the hilt between communism and capitalism is inevitable today of course we are not strong enough to attack our time will come in thirty or forty years to win we shall need the element of surprise the western world will have to be put to sleep so we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record there shall be electrifying overtures and unheard of concessions the capitalist countries stupid and decadent will rejoice to cooperate with their own destruction they will leap at another chance to be friends as soon as their guard is down we shall smash them with our clenched fist
6180203 first we will take eastern europe then the masses of asia then we will encircle the united states which will be the last bastion of capitalism we will not have to attack it will fall into our hands like an overripe fruit
6180204 it must be recognized the communists are agents of a foreign power whose aim is not only to destroy the institutions and liberties of our country but also to kill millions of americans
6180205 we must realize that we cannot coexist eternally for a long time one of us must go to his grave we do not want to go to the grave they america do not want to go to their grave either so what must be done we must push them to the grave
6180206 i can prophecy that your grandchildren in america will live under socialism and please do not be afraid of that your grandchildren will not understand how their grandparents did not understand the progressive nature of a socialist society
6180207 our firm conviction is that sooner or later capitalism will give way to socialism whether you like it or not history is on our side we will bury you
6180208 the united states will eventually fly the communist red flag the american people will hoist it themselves
6180209 we communists have got to string along with the capitalists for awhile we need their credits their agriculture and their technology but we are going to continue massive military programs and by the middle 1980s we will be in a position to return to a much more aggressive foreign policy designed to gain the upper hand in our relationship with the west
6180210 trust us comrades for by 1985 as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente we will have achieved most of our objectives in western europe we will have consolidated our position we will have improved our economy and a decisive shift in the correlation of forces will be such that come 1985 we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to
6180211 we are at war with the communists and the sooner every red blooded american realizes this the safer we will be
6180212 communists want to control everything where you live where you work what you are paid what you think how your children are educated what you may not and must read and write remember always that it could happen here and that there are thousands of people in this country now working in secret to make it happen here
6180213 to defend the soviet union and to remain at all times a vigilant and firm defender of the leninist line of the party the only line that insures the triumph of soviet power in the u s
6180214 i dream of the hour when the last congressman is strangled to death on the guts of the last preacher and since christians love to sing about the blood why not give them a little of it
6180215 there is no force on earth that can stop the soviet unions advance and the triumph of communism
6180216 the soviet union was never as strong as it is today
6180217 top ranking party officials declared today that the soviet union is mightier than it has ever been and is no longer threatened by force making the triumph of communism inevitable
6180218 today thousands of highly trained russian and red china undercover master subverters live under respectable cover occupations and professions in all countries of the western democracies international security officers estimate that at least thirty thousand undercover subverters paid by moscow and peking and continually undermining the western democracies they are aided by specially trained communist party members and fellow travelers the conservative estimate by western security experts is that at least half a million men and women are at work all over the world bringing about the downfall of the profit making economic system
6180219 the communists in western europe and america must strive everywhere to awaken the masses and draw them into the struggle it is difficult to do this in western europe and america but it can be done and must be done propaganda agitation and organization inside the armed movements and among the oppressed must be coordinated in a new way
6180220 whole solar system of organizations and smaller committees around the communist party actually working under the influence of the party but not under its mechanical control
6180221 the way to assure success is for us to create not one but two undercover subverter networks they will operate simultaneously in all the countries of the capitalist world the undercover subverters of the first network will operate quite independently of the second in each capitalistic country one undercover subverter network will be composed of tried and trusted communists who are nationals of that country their activities will be directed by comrade suslov who will be responsible to the politburo this network of undercover subverters will comprise of men and women of ability and intelligence especially selected for these qualities as soon as they undertake the undercover subverter work they will sever all contact with the communist party and dedicate themselves to working for the party by indirect methods they will be called upon to join and operate within organizations and societies that are bourgeois and opposed to communism and the soviet union they will engage in undercover subverter activities within these organizations and societies on behalf of the communist party it will be necessary for them to conceal their previous and present connection with the communist party they will create the impression they are opposed to the ideology of communism the second network of undercover subverters will consist of operators of soviet nationality these comrades will be under direct orders from our secret service headquarters kgb a new department of secret service headquarters will be created forthwith to be named special division for subversion the directors of this special division will select and train recruits of soviet nationality for this professional undercover master subverters network in the same way that they select and train soviet comrades for work abroad as secret service network operators
6180222 the leaders of all communist parties must select completely trustworthy comrades who will take up undercover subverters work outside the communist party their activity will be revolutionary and subversive it is essential that these chosen comrades sever all connections with the party it is desirable that they become regarded as antagonistic to the party and in conflict with its policy
6180223 free to move about without restraint or check and in order to visit our arsenals depots factories and proving grounds they had only to make known their desires i personally know that scores of russians were permitted to enter american territory in 1942 without visa
6180224 it is of vital importance to cripple the armaments industry and all other important industries of all capitalist enemies it is of still greater importance to accomplish this within that cradle of aggression war hungry america the americans are feverishly preparing for war against the peace loving bloc of the soviet union and other peoples democracies
6180225 because the united states of america is our enemy number one even more ruthless action is called for in that country
6180226 i will use it for the first time when i strike it in triumph on the table the day we sign a pact of nonaggression and eternal love between the soviet union and america and a second time when we sign a treaty of disarmament with all the nations of the world i await with impatience my talks with your president eisenhower hoping that our two hearts will be prompted to reach agreement and establish conditions of peace and friendship
6180227 the major points in this revolutionary program of the communists are 1 overthrow and destruction of the federal state and provincial governments with the elimination of existing constitutional forms and foundations 2 establishment of a soviet dictatorship absolute in its exercise of power owing allegiance to and conceding the authority only of the communist or third internationale at moscow as a governmental substitute 3 destruction of all social economic and political institutions as they exist at this time 4 seizure of all labor unions through a process of boring from within them and utilizing them as a strategic instrument in fulfillment of their revolutionary designs upon organized and constitutional government
6180228 1 comrades working in telegraph teleprinter and telephone services must organize an effective monitoring system to intercept important communications and enable the party to learn what is going on inside the u s government the security forces industry and in all other important establishments 2 comrades working in armament factories or in nuclear establishments must memorize all charts blueprints production lists etc that they come upon through their employment if it is possible to photograph such documents without the risk of detection this is preferable 3 comrades must make a determined effort to infiltrate all sections of the u s armed forces he should be converted into a determined opponent of war between the united states and the soviet union acts of sabotage at nuclear bases are invaluable if the well publicized launchings of a space rocket results in a failure this is of tremendous propaganda value 4 in addition to the above special tasks everyday life in all parts of the u s must be disrupted as often and as effectively as possible racial riots are the most easily provoked disorders if they are brought about in a way which makes it seem that the ruling class has precipitated the riots this is valuable propaganda the class enemy must be discredited hit often and where it hurts the most
6180229 the exchange program in the soviet eyes is simply another operation in communist political warfare the people that the kremlin sends over here are to a man trained agents of soviet policy some of them are spies seeking information all of them are trusted carriers of communist propaganda their mission is not cultural but political their aim is not to inform but to mislead their assignment is not to convey a true image of the soviet union but a false image the kremlins hope is that they will persuade the american people to forget the ugly aspects of soviet life and the danger that the soviet system poses to american freedom but the kremlins aim is not to make americans approve of communism much as they would like that it is to make us tolerant of communism they know that if americans regard the soviet union as a dangerous implacable enemy communism will not be able to conquer the world
6180230 go to the youth form fighting squads everywhere at three ten and thirty persons let them arm themselves at once as best they can be it with a revolver a knife a rag soaked in kerosene to start fires some may undertake to kill a spy or blow up a police station others to raid a bank for insurrection let every group learn if only by beating up a policeman this will train hundreds of experienced fighters who tomorrow will be leading hundreds of thousands
6180231 get the youth corrupted get them away from religion get them interested in sex destroy their ruggedness get control of all publicity divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters destroy the peoples faith in their leaders always preach true democracy but seize power as fact and us ruthlessly as possible encourage government extravagance destroy its credit incite unnecessary strikes and civil disobedience cause the registration of firearms on some pretext with view to confiscate them leaving the population helpless
6180232 concentrate upon the young the most malleable and most gullible section of the population
6180233 the student population must be induced to demonstrate publicly and fight vigorously for their rights subtle undercover tactics must be adopted to ensure these demonstrations culminate in rioting and street fighting the objective is to create a dangerous revolutionary situation in which law and order is discredited simultaneously our undercover cadres in industry commerce the trade unions religious organizations and political parties must propagate the idea that the working population should give full support to any students strike actions
6180234 grievance strikes more wildcat strikes and more trade union obstruction to smooth working of industry more racial riots and more sabotage to industrial plants
6180235 the more troops they america send to vietnam the happier we shall be we shall then have them in our power and can have their blood
6180236 we can hope to do little more than mitigate our problems as best we can and learn how to live with them
6180237 proven itself a reliable and stalwart associate in the advancement of certain interests on which our interests coincide
6180238 being confident of our own future we are now free of that inordinate fear of communism
6180239 i dont think you want to involve american troops even if el salvador was about to fall to communist backed guerrillas
6180240 the russians are determined to conquer the world they will employ force murder lies flattery subversion bribery extortion and treachery everything they stand for and believe in is a contradiction of our understandings of the nature of men their artful use of propaganda has anesthetized the free world our will to resist is being steadily eroded
6180241 greater than we had originally planned and in fact more than we require
6180242 if salt ii is passed we are in the final 1000 days of history
6180243 out man out gun out build us in most meaningful military categories
6180244 the soviets have deployed and developed the most intensive system of nuclear shelter for its military leadership its civilian leadership its industrial factory workers and its civilian population ever deployed or built in history
6180245 every single key provision of both salt agreements originated with soviet strategic experts and planners in the kremlin approved by leonid brezhnev and his closest associates in the politburo and was passed by soviet ambassador anatoly f dobrynin to henry kissinger who then provided the rationalization for it and sold it to president nixon
6180246 in short the soviets will soon have a first strike capability authorized by salt and when that capability is in hand soviet leaders may logically presume that the u s would not retaliate after a first strike soviet leaders could reason that a u s president would not order a retaliation knowing that his few surviving weapons could not annihilate soviet society and that a counterstrike by soviet second strike weapons would in fact utterly destroy the u s as a viable society the fact is that after a first strike the soviets would have more missiles and bombers in reserve for the second strike that the u s had to start with
6180247 it seems that the same cannibalistic instincts prevail now in the white house by which in 1945 the then president truman was guided when ordering the use of atomic weapons
6180248 the united states is not now inferior to the soviet union in overall military strength
6180249 the best way to insure peace is to be prepared for war
6180250 it is the professional judgment of senior officials in the united states that our navy has only a 35 probability of winning a conventional naval war against the soviet union our military knows this and so does theirs about the only people who do not know it are the general public in the united states and australia nor do they know that a nuclear exchange in 1981 on present trends would result in about 160 million dead in the united states
6180251 the soviet build up is far beyond any requirements of self defense indeed the soviets are building the greatest war machine the world has ever seen this is more than a challenge to the west it is the most deadly threat to freedom and to peace any generation has ever known
6180252 we will take iran not by direct intervention but it will fall into our hands like an overripe piece of fruit
6180253 russia is planning a new offensive in the middle east our precise and categorical information is that russia plans to have totally taken over southern africa all the middle east and western europe by january 8 9 1984
6180254 i perceive the world to be more dangerous than it has ever been in its history
6180255 in the struggle for peace and social progress the communist party of the soviet union pursues a consistent policy of rallying the forces of the international communist and working class movement in every possible way we uphold the historical justness of the great ideas of marxism leninism and along with all the revolutionary and peace loving forces of mankind stand for social progress and peace and security for all nations this is what should determine the resolute nature of our propaganda
6180256 in our work and worries we are motivated by those leninist ideals and noble endeavors and goals which mobilized the workers of russian seven decades ago to fight for the new and happy world of socialism perestroika restructuring is a continuation of the october revolution
6180257 gentlemen comrades do not be concerned about all you hear about glasnost and perestroika and democracy in the coming years these are primarily for outward consumption there will be no significant internal change within the soviet union other than for cosmetic purposes our purpose is to disarm the americans and let them fall asleep
6180258 we are moving toward a new world the world of communism we shall never turn off that road
6180259 we are not going to change soviet power of course or abandon its fundamental principles but we acknowledge the need for changes that will strengthen socialism
6180260 the concept the main idea lies in the fact that we want to give a new lease on life to socialism through perestroika and to reveal the potential of the socialist system
6180261 through perestroika we want to give socialism a second wind to achieve this the communist party of the soviet union returns to the origins and principles of the bolshevik revolution to the leninist ideas about the construction of a new society
6180262 today we have perestroika the salvation of socialism giving it a second breath revealing everything good which is in the system
6180263 i am a communist a convinced communist for some that may be a fantasy but for me it is my main goal
6180264 i am now just as ive always been a convinced communist its useless to deny the enormous and unique contribution of marx engels and lenin to the history of social thought and to modern civilization as a whole
6180265 i hereby discontinue my activities at the post of president of the union of soviet socialist republics were now living in a new world
6180266 the point is that the communist goal is fixed and changeless it never varies one iota from their objective of world domination but if we judge them only by the direction in which they seem to be going we shall be deceived
6180267 when we are weak boast of strength when we are strong feign weakness
6180268 the soviets intend to conceal vast reserves of missiles and warheads hiding them in places throughout the expansive soviet union where the imperialists could not spot them later they could be launched in a nuclear war
6180269 perestroika is expressly designed to enhance soviet military capability and combat readiness
6180270 indicative of this strange event which occurred in october of 1964 david rockefeller president of the chase manhattan bank and chairman of the board of the council on foreign relations took a vacation in the soviet union this is a peculiar place for the worlds greatest imperialist to take his vacation since much of the communist propaganda deals with taking all of davids wealth away from him and distributing it to the people a few days after rockefeller ended his vacation in the kremlin nikita khrushchev was recalled from a vacation at a black sea resort to learn that he had been fired how strange as far as the world knew khrushchev was the absolute dictator of the soviet government and more important head of the communist party which runs the ussr who has the power to fire the man who was supposedly the absolute dictator did david rockefeller journey to the soviet union to fire an employee obviously the position of premier in the soviet union is a figurehead with the true power residing elsewhere perhaps in new york
6180271 the american people will never knowingly adopt socialism but under the name of liberalism they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program until one day america will be a socialist nation without knowing how it happened
6180272 i think we may be the only great country in the world moving toward great socialism
6180273 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
6180274 but barack obama had a crucial advantage over his rivals this year the support of the national media especially the three broadcast networks
6180275 at every step of his national political career network reporters showered the illinois senator with glowing media coverage building him up as a political celebrity and exhibiting little interest in investigating his past associations or exploring the controversies that could have threatened his campaign
6180276 when it mattered most as he debuted on the national scene
6180277 this study proves emphatically and without question that the big three networks had a horse in this years democratic primary race and that with their wall to wall 24 hour daily assistance nbc abc and cbs provided sen barack obamas margin of victory
6180278 as the liberal medias ardor with sen hillary clinton evaporated so too did the inevitability of her victory the press fixated their infatuated gazes on sen obama and afforded him the crucial coverage and support he needed to win
6180279 allah was recognized as the creator of the universe by many who nevertheless still worshipped the smaller gods because only these could be expected to answer prayer and to protect from danger
6180280 a photojournalist has to be prepared for all circumstances all conditions

6180283 i saw the quality of his photography at the time i knew we were looking for photographers martin expressed interest saying he had wanted to work with us for a long time i advised him to convert to digital photography after which i recommended him to management
6180284 the news of russias potential response to the u s poland missile shield is causing crude to recover from earlier losses here
6180285 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system

6180325 but no one is capable of defending us against the chinese jamming and whats more our website is still blocked
6180326 the rwandan authorities dont want a press that acclaims them but we ask that the press reports the facts faithfully what we dont want is lies and exaggeration
6180327 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6180328 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
6180329 today we recognise the service of lance corporal john gillespie a husband a father a grandfather a mate
6180330 there is no higher calling in our land than to wear the uniform of australia
6180331 today as prime minister of australia i say a grateful nation thanks you the veterans of vietnam for your service to australia
6180332 im just feeling that its not closure i dont use that word closure
6180333 i feel an end of a journey and i feel that for the gillespie family for johns sisters and brothers that its just most important that we have finally come to this stage to say that weve finally got him home
6180334 we worked together and look what it achieved weve got him home as the words on the plaque say home at last
6180335 a lot of the ceremonies are very difficult for us but when we have time to reflect and actually come back when its quiet weve got special places to go and remember him
6180336 due to the massive financial loss incurred at the aug 2 concert our main sponsor pulling out of the series and no beer permit in hand we have been left with no other option except cancellation
6180337 we appreciate the continued support we have received from the people and business owners of north tonawanda and hope that we can find some resolution to this matter allowing us to produce more concerts at gateway park in the years to come

6180341 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
6180342 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6180343 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
6180344 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
6180345 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
6180346 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops
6180347 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
6180348 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
6180349 its nice to get the rankings but we know potential has yet to win a wrestling match
6180350 this entire coaching staff worked extremely hard to get these kids interested in our program and the rankings are a nice reward for those efforts
6180351 this was a strong recruiting class aimed at shoring up the immediate concerns of the program
6180352 we werent sure what to expect from the draft but we knew that a number of these players would be drafted to get this many quality players through the draft and onto campus makes this a very strong class
6180353 sam brown and alex sogard played very prominent roles for us last year and were extremely happy to get them back after they were drafted
6180354 it was very important for us to get those two guys back
6180355 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today

6180359 its a good idea particularly if you havent used a recipe or canned at all for a few years to make sure your procedures and recipes are up to date
6180360 the recipes on these sites are all tested and safe to use but if you find something on the internet or have an old family recipe i recommend calling the extension office i can often screen a recipe over the phone and tell if its safe to use or not

6180399 high commissioner john dauth has apologised to miss clark who has accepted the apology
6180400 miss clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and that she had had a bit of a laugh
6180401 she is renowned for her managerial skills the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
6180402 she holds generally leftwing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war
6180403 she does not trust those outside the small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in new zealand known as h2
6180404 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs of other leaders fall off the back of trucks youd all have a lot of laughs as well

6180408 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6180409 the board continues to pursue strategic alternatives for the company that offer the best possible results for our shareholders in the long term

6180425 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team it looks a bit like christmas lights this is a very conservative sport their excuse is that you cannot have accessories on your swimsuit but the lights were sewn in if you use those standards sequins are a type of accessory

6180433 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
6180434 home actually started life as the getaway online for playstation 2 that project never came to fruition but it gave us a good backbone of network code then we were given a playstation 3 dev kit so we started porting everything across and getting it working initially only over a lan connection phil harrison loved the idea of a network hub for gamers and the team grew from there
6180435 before we started working on the ps3 our art style was a legacy of the getaway series dirty gritty london pub interiors
6180436 so we sat down to decide what look we should develop for the ps3 we wanted the art style to be as accessible as possible to look great graphically and appealing enough for anyone to pick up and use
6180437 we took the unusual step of releasing a closed beta to the community very early in development as a result of the feedback from that we moved from the original lobby which was like a pill shaped room to home square which is a lot lighter airier and with clearer destinations
6180438 getting the thing running basically all of the classic limitations you face as a game developer such as running out of memory are even more stringent for us because were online
6180439 it has five bowling lanes two high resolution screens downloading video on demand six pool tables and eight arcade cabinets all featuring dynamic objects added to that you potentially have 64 unique characters all with different animations and you have voice chat and text chat going on all at the same time and then we have to take into account that some of our users have relatively slow internet connections
6180440 weve kept fairly quiet on the press side of things
6180441 beforehand there was a greater focus on the social networking aspect of home
6180442 and although thats still very important now the emphasis has shifted to suit the ps3 gamer initial users of home will be relatively early adopters of ps3 theyre gamers
6180443 were nothing without our community and as we get more feedback from them were going to start seeing bubbles of change well see groups of rpg fans or resistance 2 fans gathering and then third parties will start catering for them we expect home to grow as communities form within communities
6180444 half of the development team is actually a tools team
6180445 because third parties need to be able to create content to the same standard as you see in home today and that doesnt just apply to clothing furniture and items but entire spaces we have a robust and complex toolkit that allows third parties to create content for home easily
6180446 were starting slowly because we dont want to flood the community with tools that hardly anyone is going to use
6180447 user generated content can go either way there can be not enough and everything looks the same or there can be too much and people clutter up the place with rubbish
6180448 theres an important division between user generated content and customisation
6180449 home is already very customisable and thats the avenue were most interested in exploring at the moment

6180477 dent lies at the bottom of the hole his neck broken
6180478 honestly right now im just kind of taking it on a day by day basis
6180479 its disappointing but im glad it happened during preseason than during the regular season
6180480 if you had your druthers you would have him play in the game so were hopeful that he can play
6180481 i had a chance to digest everything that happened in that situation in the off season and right now i am strictly focused on being ready
6180482 we have a team here and we are all grown men and you have to handle the situation the way it is like grown men
6180483 he wasnt 100 per cent there mentally all the time but he got into it he got better and got better and got better
6180484 hopefully edwards injury will show him what weve been telling him hey youre one snap away and youve got to be ready
6180485 and that was my boat in the video its actually something i was buying for an ex girlfriend years ago and she was being really mean at the time i was gonna put her name on the back but i was like whatever put cowboy on the back and ship it to detroit
6180486 ive always said to me videos are not the point its more about the song
6180487 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive you have something like this happen it could have been marilyn manson it could have been any number of people who make art that is startling visually on the darker side it couldve been pat boone for christs sake at the end of the day there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that theyre fucked up and lost and all we can do is try to learn from it
6180488 we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet
6180489 using the information provided by comcast pursuant to this order as well as information submitted by the public we will closely monitor the companys network management practices
6180490 current p2p management is triggered regardless of the level of overall network congestion and regardless of the time of day
6180491 entitled to run applications and use services of their choice
6180492 will not hesitate to take action to address their conduct
6180493 if cable companies such as comcast are barred from inhibiting consumer access to high definition on line video content
6180494 consumers with cable modem service will have available a source of video programming much of it free that could rapidly become an alternative to cable television
6180495 from discriminatory to nondiscriminatory network management practices by the end of the year
6180496 including the thresholds that will trigger any limits on customers access to bandwidth
6180497 our overriding aim here is to end comcasts use of unreasonable network practices
6180498 and our remedy sends the unmistakable message that comcasts conduct must stop
6180499 as you can imagine well need to review the order
6180500 so all we can say right now is we are examining the order and evaluating our options
6180501 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to unfettered internet access
6180502 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under ricky s full time care
6180503 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6180504 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6180505 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6180506 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6180507 its dangerous because it sucks up resources that could be spread around to have more general health impact instead of focusing efforts on people with one disease and ignoring people with others
6180508 basic nutrition can help provide immunity support that can prevent or ameliorate malaria aids and tuberculosis when people have poor nutrition and are generally unhealthy they are more susceptible to these illnesses
6180509 you cant go in with a pre designed programme and that needs to improve big time
6180510 communities know what they want and what they need they understand their priorities
6180511 we identify what is going on and address what theyd like to improve
6180512 there is not enough humility in the willingness to be equal partners in our efforts on the ground
6180513 we may have technical knowledge but they locals have the cultural and practical knowledge we need to be most effective and efficient
6180514 aids and tb are diseases that scare the hell out of people in developed nations because they are global and spreading
6180515 clean water would be a much better way to improve public health in places like africa in the long run but its very costly infrastructure
6180516 all you have to do is look at the funding towards those things and funding on water
6180517 are we going to allocate 100 times the amount of money towards malaria than water
6180518 this agreement signals our ability to acquire residential land loans on a national scale and manage the associated risk in this challenged marketplace
6180519 we hope this is the start of a long term relationship with wachovia which will allow each company to achieve its own business objectives

6180546 as democracy is perfected the office of president represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6180547 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag carrying a cross
6180548 those who give up liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both
6180549 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
6180550 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
6180551 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public
6180552 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states

6180557 not only is this an important moment in the history of speedway motorsports it is also an important moment in the history of nhra drag racing
6180558 this is a magnificent facility that will set the standard for the future of drag racing
6180559 i know his seriously his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6180560 this is one of those tracks where a win means a lot to the teams and all of the drivers because of the history and just how big the races here are
6180561 weve had some shots to win here but things havent gone our way
6180562 ive had some awesome cars at bristol and its just a matter of time until we get a complete race put together this is a very good track for this fedex team we just need the results to show it
6180563 its hard not to look at the standings and check where you stand against the cutoff but you cant let that force you to race a certain way
6180564 if it makes you take less risks in terms of fuel mileage or things of that nature that makes sense but you have to race like you know how to race no exceptions it only ends up throwing you off
6180565 weve gone through this before and its a really bad feeling
6180566 i didnt think we had a race winning car at michigan but we did what we had to do to make it better each and every stop had quick stops on pit road and were going to have a good points day and thats what we needed with the chase coming up
6180567 all is lost and there is no reason to continue on
6180568 i think everyone in the garage can say point taken
6180569 its unfortunate that those guys went to that and tried to slide in that magnet im impressed that nascar found it and saw it
6180570 when you blatantly go after stuff they come down hard on you we were a quarter inch wide on a template that didnt exist and had a six week suspension and a bunch of other stuff go on i can imagine if it is a rule like that if it has to do with traction control tires or messing with the power like that nascar does not like that they have said it all along there are a few unwritten things that you dont touch and i think that falls into that category
6180571 its like watching someone close to you get hurt and then hurting the person that hurt them
6180572 youre still not right two wrongs dont make a right
6180573 i think from a penalty status the biggest thing that sets out in my mind is what they did they did not cheat in that race at michigan in my opinion
6180574 a hundred percent they did not cheat in that race at michigan but what they did was even worse than that they attempted to cheat in the next two seasons by doing what they did on that dynojet its worse than cheating in that one race
6180575 its almost like what they did was just worse than even cheating in that one race i almost wish they would have cheated in that one race because i would have felt better about it but what they attempted to do was cheat us for the rest of the season all the way up to probably atlanta of next year before another dyno test was done
6180576 the reality of it was that they still had a better package and the fact that we put the plate on just accentuated that along with the fact that their teams got stronger
6180577 so then youre left in a situation where you have a manufacturer which has built an engine that is just designed superior to ours and there was really nothing that nascar could do they didnt have an old motor to go back to they couldnt take away the toyota motor
6180578 i hear from the fans all the time well why dont you guys go to work well we did we did go to work to fix it but the piece thats sitting on the table makes no sense to bring out ill give nascar the credit that when they came up with the taper rule to reduce the toyotas and kind of looking at their thinking and my view of it is that i think there is a financial cold war of a sense in the series in the sport and by not allowing chevrolet to have their new engine theyre not necessarily prolonging but trying to lessen that effect
6180579 if we were given the new engine tomorrow wed be right there with the toyota
6180580 we need those guys so it was a tough decision and the decision to put the plate on to reduce the toyotas was one that i didnt even feel very good about because i hate to see that happen and i understand 100 percent what gibbs went through and why they would be disappointed and why they would do the things that they did
6180581 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6180582 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion

6180629 i went to speak to a group of neurosurgeons out in scottsdale ariz basically on teamwork you know the brain and the spine getting the two types of neurosurgeons to work together
6180630 i went and spoke to them and when they were going to pay me for that i said just take the money and put it in the local childrens hospital
6180631 a few months went by two or three and they came back with the idea of pediatric trauma and once they started explaining it to us my first question was how could this be this is the 21st century and this shouldnt be this should have been addressed 50 years ago or longer we know that research works it saves lives once they started explaining to us about the need for it and the need for awareness of it we got on board and made a financial commitment we also made a commitment to get the word out and do fundraisers to do what it takes to get us to the next level
6180632 ill probably be going to congress this year to testify to the national institutes of health
6180633 for every man woman and child in america they spent 18 or something like that and we know that works
6180634 but for every man woman and child in america they spend nine cents on childhood trauma and thats the no 1 killer of our children more than 12 000 children died last year from trauma more than 100 000 were left injured needing rehabilitation and theres no single rehabilitation center in america to help take care of these children much less for the needs of the families
6180635 the worst thing any of us can do is to lose a child and that is the kind of thing that when something like that happens we need help for those families
6180636 theres a thousand other examples some of your first response vehicles may not have a small enough mask to fit a child they may not have a small enough cuff to get true blood pressures and things these are the things that we want to go out and let people know how to save the lives of children and it starts from first response
6180637 i just think were connected so closely to our fans closer than any other sport
6180638 just the things that we see we travel a lot and you see sick kids injured kids and families that have gone through trauma you cant believe the amount of letters that come through here that tell their stories or ask for their help on a dying child it just weve hired a full time minister here just to help us with a lot of that
6180639 ive had employees lose children and friends to lose children and to see how hard it is on them and how hard it is on the family my brother lost his son in a car accident
6180640 theres so many children out there today that are in trauma that i think we can save some of those 12 000 that died last year
6180641 theres only 14 level 1 childrens trauma centers in the u s today and we want to take the wake forest baptist medical center and create it as a level 1 trauma center model so that all these other hospitals can come in and see what it takes to become a level 1 childrens trauma center
6180642 will have a national impact and bring much more attention and awareness to this issue we need a better way to treat children and there is not enough research being done
6180643 service for friends family and co workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick frequent answers to one simple question what are you doing

6180655 in terms of the credit rating assigned the inflation is not a topic to be concerned about nor an important aspect because it is maintained at a one digit level and also the central reserve bank bcr is taking measures addressed to lessening inflation shocks
6180656 we do not expect that inflation will reach the two digit rate and this perspective was a factor considered in the recent rating given to peru

6180673 the hot rumor going around idf is one that we discussed a long time ago when nvidia bought stexar that the company will do an x86 part
6180674 the problem nv has is that both major x86 players have a lock on the technology and they dont want any new players in the mix via certainly has a nice part with the nano but they barely got out under the threat of a lot of legal fighting and nvidia certainly doesnt have the x86 patent leverage via has nv is basically locked out unless intel and amd both decide to be magnanimous and we would not recommend holding your breath waiting for this to happen

6180723 our execution is solid right now my hope was that after today i would feel better about our depth but thats now how i feel but the players in front of them i feel very good about
6180724 not only offensively and defensively there were drop offs from our ones special teams then took a drop off even more than that with a few key players so poor in fundamentals and assignments that we couldnt function
6180725 opera because i like the dramatic delivery and emotional display i also like the juxtaposition of the various parts and how they flow into interact with one another
6180726 weve reviewed our dates because we were consulting with people and other events as well
6180727 we want to make sure that we give everybody the opportunity to go

6180746 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6180747 wants to see the studies that the epa required when it approved a pesticide made by bayer cropscience five years ago
6180748 scientists believe that the decline in bees is linked to an onslaught of pesticides mites parasites and viruses as well as a loss of habitat and food
6180749 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6180750 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise
6180751 i think videogames are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6180752 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6180753 this is it the real thing the original authentic world of mexican wrestling lucha libre usa aaa presents legendary battles of triplemania five of the most savage no holds barred matches youll ever witness starring the greatest aaa wrestlers on the planet there are no compromises in triplemania its brother versus brother when superstars charly manson and electroshock take each other on father versus son when masked warriors juventude guerrera and fuerza guerrera do battle and pure pandemonium when the likes of cibernetico chessman and x pac step into the dome of death to engage in whats been described as one of the most exciting bouts in the history of mexican wrestling
6180754 by concealing your desires you may trick people into being cruel about the wrong thing
6180755 to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6180756 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6180757 lets remember the nature of the country this conference was in syria has not cooperated with the international atomic energy agency in providing flight access they are sponsors of some of the worst terrorist organizations in the world they stand credibly charged for being behind the assassination of a number of lebanese officials including former prime minister hariri
6180758 another indication of the inexperience senator obama has in conducting foreign policy and maybe an indication of his inability to do so in a way that would be responsible which is the point that hillary clinton made when senator obama said that he would negotiate with some of these people without precondition
6180759 maybe this is a playing out of his negotiating with dictators without precondition
6180760 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6180761 whether it was a war or an earthquake or men landing on the moon it would always come down to that
6180762 the cat will mew and dog will have his day
6180763 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
6180764 were on our way out of office the way things look now the last confrontation between us and the bad guys will have been one that they won we cant let our term end that way this cant be the last word we have to go out in a blaze of glory where should we set off that blaze iran of course no country has taunted us more relentlessly by bombing iran we will send the world a defiant farewell message forget russia we still rule

6180767 theyre in the best position with respect to the patent cliff they have very little generic competition as well they have a nice pipeline too specifically a rheumatoid arthritis drug as well as an anti platelet drug and we like their management

6180784 its not just the housing picture that one has to fathom but its also public policy what is the government going to do
6180785 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6180786 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
6180787 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hezbollah attacks
6180788 at that time we had hezbollah in our sights and not the lebanese state but the hezbollah fighters do not live on the moon and some infrastructure was hit
6180789 the moment hezbollah takes control of the lebanese government we will have to address the consequences
6180790 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
6180791 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organisation and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state we will not be so restrained
6180792 and its a centralized location where people can interact easier with the congressional office
6180793 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

6180795 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
6180796 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works
6180797 hey ed do you know what it means to have such a gad damn stupid person tell you he is a doctor

6180815 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house

6180847 my friend was stopped at a checkpoint on the road to irbil from baghdad the people in the car had to show their id cards to the masked men
6180848 they could see she was christian from her name they dragged her from the car pushed her to her knees and put a gun to her head
6180849 they told her to convert to islam or die she refused and started praying out loud but they did not kill her not straight away they raped her and then she was shot in the head
6180850 our neighborhood in mosul was nicknamed death street two weeks before we left my next door neighbor was shot in his home the terrorists said give the child to your wife when he did this they shot him four or five times in front of the woman and her little one

6180856 christian refugees from iraq do not want to go back they feel they are being driven out

6180858 the authorities here will not see lebanon as an asylum country until the palestinian issue has been resolved

6180867 process of political give and take which applied to the easiest place
6180868 should in a way apply to the most difficult place which is kirkuk

6180944 i still remember the day when he was appointed as head tte he quietly took his appointment letter showing little emotion today he is the chief ticket inspector cti and 8230 rarely does anyone get two promotions in four years but sushils work ethic has earned him one

6180946 he always wanted to build his strength and 8230 if the coach wanted him to do 10 push ups he would do 12
6180947 we used to have a terrible time getting him for national camps simply because he didnt keep a mobile phone we had to send people to chhatrasal stadium in delhi to tell him about the national camp or get the word to his coaches yashvir and ramphal
6180948 and when you scolded him for that he would just bow his head down and listen
6180949 i know how disappointed he was when he returned from athens after losing to a cuban in the first round but he decided to start afresh

6180953 weve received all the support and collaboration of mabel feliz b ez president of the national drugs council and expect the baninter commission receives all assets seized in the coming days
6180954 each administrator and the judicial overseers have been working in the rendering of accounts of their tenure weve met with some of them and we highly value the great work carried out to maintain many of those assets in operating and competitive conditions
6180955 the most wonderful time of the year was in the winter because there wasnt much work to do in the fields and snow packed the roads offering early residents an opportunity to travel everywhere by horse and sleigh
6180956 molly has always had a penchant for local history and has worked tirelessly to preserve our past and educate those interested in learning from her
6180957 she has been the thread joining the past to the present keeping the old historical society going and rejuvenating interest
6180958 people gave their treasures to the museum so i wanted to do right by them
6180959 it was very satisfying to help families find their ancestors
6180960 my office has been in my basement not a good thing for historians for when they die too many valuable books and papers disappear
6180961 we will miss her valuable wealth of knowledge about the history and genealogy of the town
6180962 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
6180963 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
6180964 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
6180965 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
6180966 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
6180967 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities
6180968 all those who are called out of the world to worship god through christ
6180969 the fear of the lord it is that way of life which springs from a reverent acknowledgement of the holiness of god
6180970 take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground
6180971 o god of our fathers in yonder heaven in your providence show us thy tender mercies bless our mess etc
6180972 this master plan of god is designed around the deepest needs of human beings respect self worth self esteem
6180973 but god is unique and who can turn him and what his soul desires that he does
6180974 once a person believes he is an unworthy sinner it is doubtful says schuller if he can really honestly accept the saving grace god offers in jesus christ
6180975 the self love movement that was begun by humanistic psychologists has already had a significant impact on the church you cannot simply add the insights of this new teaching to your set of existing christian beliefs if you add them you must modify or subtract many of the beliefs you already hold you are divergent views of man his problem and how to solve it
6180976 i tell you the truth before abraham was born i am
6180977 i told you that you would die in your sins if you do not believe that i am yahweh elohim in human flesh you will indeed die in your sins
6180978 get these out of here how dare you turn my fathers house into a market
6180979 for your donation of 50 or more ill send you some little trinket or bauble worth less than 1 5 of that price
6180980 therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord
6180981 emphasize that were saved not just to avoid hell whatever that means and whatever that is but were saved to become positive thinkers inspired to think gods will
6180982 imagine theres no heaven its easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky
6180983 holy holy holy is the lord almighty the whole earth is full of his glory
6180984 he who wants to win the world for christ must have the courage to come into conflict with it
6180985 never again will i curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood
6180986 the greek word in the new testament to describe us as enemies of god carries all these ideas and implications strange that mankind should bear malice toward a kind and beneficent creator but that is the heart of the of the doctrine here set forth the original word is often used passively for hatred odious or hateful but in its active form as in our text it expresses the conscious hostility of one who hates or opposes another
6180987 isnt it cool god loves you and hes just waiting to help you to fulfill your purpose
6180988 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
6180989 the christian faith is not about you its about me
6180990 this medal is a gift of years of hard work and toil
6180991 since he was very confident we expected him to win a gold but its okay even winning bronze in the olympics is not a mean achievement
6180992 he is a braveheart and often challenged wrestlers double his size at the akhara
6180993 i was interested in the profession since i was nine because my mother was a fashion designer and i accompanied her everywhere ran errands wore the badge for the booths and got absorbed in the fun of it
6180994 now here i am training participants for the biggest hairstyling competition in india i am very excited
6180995 roos says that he found hairstyling appealing because it gave him instant gratification and he felt he could use his own vision here unlike other professions where one has to follow someone
6180996 my experience has been fantastic as i have learnt so much in every country i have been to people are fast evolving and no longer treating hair as the dead cells of the body the asian countries have created so many trendy and crazy hairdos
6180997 keep it normal for office brush it aside for an outing or pull it back on top and tie it indian hair is naturally soft thick and curly because of the humidity and pollution people should not go for complicated hairstyles
6180998 i have long nails because it is the era of unisexuality plus it helps in sectioning the hair when i am working
6180999 as for colouring trends people should go for tone on tone instead of stark contrasts a dark red with a light red looks very chic
6181000 roos also says that the indian obsession with hair oil is a myth
6181001 oil does nothing for the hair except adding gloss to it
6181002 they are the fresh selling faces currently katrina replacing aishwarya and deepika replacing preity means that the advertisers feel that the public needs new faces
6181003 katrinas not resting on her laurels post singh is kinng the actress has some exciting movies lined up hello ajab prem ki gajab kahaani yuvraj and rave party

6181005 i am reading a lot of scripts but will make a formal announcement only once they get finalised
6181006 blood gushed out and was all over my face it took a while for everyone to realise i was injured
6181007 the actor was quoted as saying by ians after a visit to the hospital a few stitches and medication zayed was back to shooting the wound is hidden by his hair so the shooting schedule in the bahamas was not disrupted
6181008 i like doing my stunts as i love to be a part of the script as much as i can
6181009 before this latest incident akshay was critically injured while shooting 75ft deep underwater surrounded by 35 sharks the star hit his head against a sunken ship which was part of the set and started bleeding
6181010 i have always performed my stunts and will continue to do so
6181011 not enough its not that stars actually go out of their way to hurt themselves sanjay dutt had a row with blue director anthony dsouza after an underwater stunt went wrong despite dutts request for extra safety measures
6181012 the christian god is a being of terrific character cruel vindictive capricious and unjust
6181013 were especially excited to include todd feinburgs show in this batch of announcements as he has been writing about emerging new media companies in the radio to mobile space and has chosen cellecast as the exclusive mobile partner for his show
6181014 was caught some 12 kilometers east of the by six fishermen who fought by space of more than six hours with gigantic marine shark
6181015 the photo looks more like an oceanic whitetip foul tempered beast but rarely reaches 300 if the shark did weigh 900 it was most probably a tiger shark or a very large mako if it was a mako i really doubt they would have been able to land it
6181016 the suspension will also allow the acceleration of the feasibility studies for the energy conversion project to change the power plant from petroleum to coal and develop the loma de miranda project
6181017 the d7 collection is what i am comfortable wearing the whole range has some part of me in it
6181018 i dont have any lucky colour or lucky outfit i love wearing black
6181019 nearly everything has got inputs from me i have sat down with the designers personally and worked it out with them i have given it my 100 per cent
6181020 i just went ahead with whatever i loved to wear and what i want to see people wear i did not read up any sportswear magazine nor consult any designer
6181021 turning designer has also allowed dhoni to indulge his passion biking he has incorporated elements from that sport into his designs
6181022 you will have to wait and see whats in store

6181027 were thrilled to add two incredibly smart presidents to our panel
6181028 along with wbebs jerry lee and harpo radios john gehron this session is shaping up to be compelling breakthrough and perhaps even a bit controversial
6181029 if you were elected president of radio what initiatives would you propose during the first 100 days of your administration
6181030 weve already received some amazing speeches from a variety of people from all levels of our industry including a hip hop dj a production director a market manager and more
6181031 you dont need a big title to have big ideas and were receiving some great initiatives from passionate people in the trenches
6181032 the christian god is a being of terrific character cruel vindictive capricious and unjust
6181033 come to the bronze friday night we could have lots of fun
6181034 i mean you get all wound up and its either pop or go crazy
6181035 i have bad dreams dawn i can see molly die and when that terrible man hurt vi i dont know if its going to be okay at all

6181038 i think im used to it and then i remember and its like im right back there
6181039 i mean you dont have to tell me about her im just kind of curious sorry
6181040 and incredibly difficult ive avoided i didnt talk about her because i felt it might be disrespectful your sister was much more important than my evil ex girlfriend in the larger scheme of things
6181041 were all weve got right now and thats more important um in the larger scheme of things right
6181042 ah est por qu no nos ponemos grupo equis con x o con equis
6181043 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6181044 im only nineteen but my mind is old and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold another nigga deceased another story gets told
6181045 who would fuck you you have all the sex appeal of a school bus on fire
6181046 i am speechless i was shivering to see the flag being unfurled in the hall
6181047 sometimes its good not have expectations but then i think i was able to show that even indian grapplers are no pushovers on the world stage
6181048 it was a terrible feeling to lose early but my coach and i had enough confidence in my abilities and till the end we believed that we could win
6181049 it was not easy i had to compete in four bouts but then even leonid had to play in four bouts
6181050 but once i got past them and had leonid in front i thought i had a chance
6181051 i knew i could beat him so i started off a little cautiously and after accumulating the points i needed i just tried to hang in there
6181052 i knew i was in the lead and i did not want to do anything foolish
6181053 i had seen the footages and knew what to expect
6181054 its not over yet i have to win the gold
6181055 coach fernandes is a crazy man he just knows one thing in life boxing sometimes we want to avoid him in the dining hall because even there he wont spare us
6181056 every fight till now has prepared me for this bout i was new then but it was an experience above all lets not forget akhil and jitenders fights they were great and spurred me on
6181057 i knew even a weak punch would open up the cut and that would end my fight
6181058 this is the tale every year the conditions here are bad and the rains make them worse
6181059 a small business needs to be so conscious of cash flow
6181060 to keep more of the profits for us thats just a good way to be
6181061 at the end of the day we did this for financial reasons
6181062 wow right now there is no one else in the entire world that can do what i just did as good as i can
6181063 ou se morre como her i ou se vive o bastante para se tornar o vil o

6181068 adesso io vado a casa non scherzo per tornare prendete la 5 o la 17
6181069 beh intanto che camminiamo a mauro salta il bottone dei pantaloni e gli cadono le braghe davanti ad un casino di gente
6181070 you dont have to show off theres no one here
6181071 we have staked the whole of all our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self government upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves to control ourselves to sustain ourselves according to the ten commandments of god
6181072 it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religions but on the gospel of jesus christ
6181073 at worst his scruples must have been quixotic not malicious
6181074 youre not the one that will get hurt if you run into someone

6181076 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6181077 just read my blog i make more sense there than here
6181078 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6181079 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6181080 we have identified six persons from pune who are active simi members but i cannot disclose their details because the investigations are at a crucial stage
6181081 reveals that obama was exactly the same 13 years ago
6181082 his determination to confront racial polarization and his cultural centrism as well as liberal politics
6181083 i should have won the second game but after i lost the third i was a little disturbed i needed to calm down and pull myself together i really dont know what happened
6181084 less than 0 001 percent of the first generation ipod nano
6181085 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
6181086 chalo assembly calls given by frontal organisations of the left parties outside
6181087 we are proud citizens of the state of jammu and kashmir
6181088 let us be realistic independence is not possible for our state we need to be allied to a bigger country people who espouse the cause of independence should understand the ground realities it is not about survival as a destroyed state but survival as a state which is viable where people can exist happily under the present circumstances freedom is not easy to sustain
6181089 certainly this is the kind of political approach we favour
6181090 every country places on the record its views but no one blocks the decision and at the end the germans as chair declare the text adopted
6181091 we will make our presentation explaining our policy restating our bottom line and answering any questions
6181092 of these at least 263 students had vision defects mainly refractive errors and squint
6181093 after detecting the problems we prescribe glasses and medicine at the school itself those who need advanced treatment come to the hospital
6181094 the growth of the eyeball stops at the age of eight even the slightest visual discomfort that a child complains about should not be ignored because delay in treatment can result in permanent eye defects or even loss of vision
6181095 children should not be allowed to sit in front of the computer for more than an hour as glaring at the screen for long will definitely strain the eyes parents should speak to children about eye safety
6181096 attendance in offices of tamil nadu transport corporation tamil nadu civil supplies corporation and tneb was 100 per cent
6181097 the dispute over the land allocated for the facilities to be provided to the amarnath yatris should be amicably settled through dialogue
6181098 there are ways in which the issue can be resolved but it is unfortunately being utilised to meet political ends which is dangerous and highly condemnable
6181099 transfer of land is not at all an issue as is being projected by the rss bjp it is merely a question of taking the land for a particular period to provide facilities to the pilgrims
6181100 on how it returning of the land could be done
6181101 the door is open for future discussions but the land in question will have first to be returned to the farmers from whom it was forcibly acquired if the agitation to begin on august 24 is to be called off our doors are always open but in a democratic set up you have to respect democratic movements
6181102 every one of those three bouts were tough i was actually fighting every 15 minutes i was tired my opponents were also tired but i was confident of winning a medal through the repechage we had very good preparation maybe you were not that sure
6181103 if we get support like the athletes of leading counries like the u s belarus and russia we can also get gold medals there is no dearth of talent in the country
6181104 once i lost that first bout i knew that i would be out if i lost a match i was very keen and decided that i would keep fighting till the end
6181105 i am really happy to win a medal for india all credit goes to my coaches and my parents especially my father who went to a far away temple to pray for my success since my teammates akhil kumar and jitender kumar had lost i was keen to win a medal
6181106 i had studied him well by watching his videos my strategy was to watch attack and defend
6181107 vijender fought very well he was brilliant his opponent was a good boxer and he has done well to win a medal he fought with skill used his mind and body as well it was really fantastic to watch him in action in such an important bout our strategy was to counter attack and to keep him fresh
6181108 the problem was that he took the lead first and it became difficult for me to overcome him in the later stages of the bout things would have been different had i taken the lead
6181109 i was asked to go all out by the coaches in the third round but i was worried about the stitches below my chin if i had got hit and started oozing blood from the chin the referee would have stopped the fight i had to be careful and the psychological barrier was more difficult to overcome than facing the opponent
6181110 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
6181111 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
6181112 it is great i have a great feeling it is a dream come true
6181113 no i was worried after the semis but i just told myself to leave everything on the track i had come here to do it and i am so happy with myself
6181114 i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible i am shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring for the world record for so long
6181115 i worked so hard to become the champion i will work harder to stay at the top
6181116 i got out good i ran the corner as hard as possible and once i entered the straight i told myself to keep it up dont die on me now
6181117 this is my first gold medal i felt so successful tonight every time i tried to throw my best
6181118 while it would be good to do this in one sitting in all likelihood there will probably have to be a second round of discussions
6181119 in effect we only have a day and half now and that may not be enough time
6181120 it is easier to work the political side of this deal than dealing with technical level players whose attitudes tend to be more rigid
6181121 and at the end of the day that is not going to be acceptable to us
6181122 we know the u s has been extensively consulting with a number of nsg members and probably has a sheet of paper with a bunch of conditions that it will say the others want
6181123 the u s likes to have its own rules and grant waiver authority to the president so it will not want the nsg to adopt something which will make it mandatory for the u s to act in a particular way if something happens between india and another supplier
6181124 i think for them the big fear is enrichment and reprocessing equipment
6181125 they have decided they will never give it to india but if tomorrow the russians or french throw in some enr equipment as a sweetener for a reactor contract which u s suppliers wont be able to do they fear others will have a commercial advantage
6181126 if subsidy is indeed thought necessary it should first go to indian coconut oil
6181127 the centre slashed keralas rice quota on the eve of onam festival this is the second blow the congress leaders owe an explanation to the people of the state why their government in new delhi is doing this
6181128 the strike was spontaneous with eight crore people participating in it it is an expression of deep indignation of the masses against the pernicious economic and labour policies of the united progressive alliance government
6181129 this should be a warning bell for the government because if it does not respond we will prolong this agitation the sponsoring committee of trade unions will meet again in september first week to chalk out further course of action
6181130 the government should realise that all the friends of american president george bush are gone and it should be ready to face the same fate if it tries to suppress the masses

6181135 half the people that leave because of the ad would have left because of the content anyway its like flicking through channels on tv
6181136 arsenal come streaming forward now surely what will be thier last attack a good ball by dixon finding smith for thomas charging through the midfield thomas its up for grabs now thomas right at the end an unbelievable climax to the league season well into injury time the liverpool players are down abject aldridge is down barnes is down dalglish just stands there nicols on his knees mcmahon on his knees
6181137 this is an exceptional important step particularly for new jerseyans who struggle with property taxes as well as all of the other rising levels of inflationary costs
6181138 on the state level we remain vigilant in our dedication to property tax relief for homeowners
6181139 over 600 000 here in new jersey own property pay property taxes but do not itemize on their income taxes
6181140 as a senior citizen on a fixed income this is certainly going to help with our property taxes

6181146 falta realmente poco para el traspaso estamos cerca de la conclusi n de las negociaciones y esperamos que las pocas cuestiones que quedan por cerrar se resuelvan cuanto antes
6181147 me ha sorprendido pero hasta que no sea oficial es in til que me pronuncie

6181152 its great to see a national spotlight being shined on the people of martinsville who have been left behind in our economy
6181153 martinsville has the highest unemployment in the state and we continue to lose manufacturing and furniture jobs to overseas competitors bringing jobs back to southside virginia will be my number one priority in congress and i launched my economic r e v i v a l tour in martinsville because this is the place that needs new leadership who will finally stand up for the american worker sen obama mark warner and i will be those leaders
6181154 martinsville has double digit unemployment jobs are going overseas the u s dollar is getting weaker and rep goode thinks our number one economic threat is same sex marriage
6181155 this really shows that since becoming a multi millionaire in congress rep goode has become seriously out of touch with the struggles of working families in southside

6181162 i have to admit i think its an odd choice to bring the star academy here
6181163 i dont watch it myself but i gather its rather a bling bling program its not really the spirit of the neighborhood
6181164 its too much power for a tv company this means that if you have money you can have your own private street

6181170 to sit here in august and commit yourself to paying 145 to 165 a ton doesnt seem like much of a bargain for our towns unfortunately communities arent being given a lot of options
6181171 it could be a timing issue it could be a supply issue it could be people ordering more it could be a combination
6181172 as we understand this is a midwest problem it isnt specific to illinois

6181197 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6181198 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

6181213 crude oil imports rose by their largest weekly amount since march as oil barges flooded the gulf shipping channel once tropical depression edouard fizzled
6181214 the surge in crude oil imports coupled with depressed levels of refinery activity resulted in a colossal rise in crude oil inventories the largest in seven years

6181254 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6181255 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries

6181320 gods holiness is not a separate attribute but the result of the sum total of all of his attributes including but not limited to his sovereignty omniscience love and righteousness holiness is a term that implies comparison god is holy in relation to the people he created when god asks his people to be holy as he is holy he means we are to maintain distinctions between ourselves and the world around us by imitating god himself

6181331 a healthy demand environment and smooth execution led to strong revenue growth in the second quarter
6181332 we are fully booked for the second half of 2008 and expect these excellent demand conditions to continue through 2009 as it stands we have already signed over 200mw of fixed price fixed volume sales contracts with strong pricing for 2009 we are also in the process of finalizing approximately 500mw of additional sales contracts which we expect to complete by the end of the third quarter
6181333 we also made great strides in silicon procurement during the second quarter we made a strategic investment in shunda finalized investments in nitol and glory silicon and recently entered into long term contracts with wacker schott crystalox and renesola we have built a diverse family of silicon suppliers that we believe will lead to greater supply stability and enhance our long term cost competitiveness through a steep declining cost curve due to these agreements we have now secured 900mw of attractively priced silicon for 2009
6181334 our high efficiency pluto technology is performing well in evaluation stage we are on track to have one 30mw pluto production line fully operational by the end of 2008 and roll out further lines in 2009 in addition the construction of our thin film plant is progressing smoothly and we expect to initiate trial production by the end of this year these initiatives will both broaden suntechs product portfolio and further differentiate suntech as a technology leader
6181335 mr zhang played an integral role in guiding suntech to our current world leading position in the solar industry and we are very grateful for his contribution we wish him all the best in his future endeavors

6181345 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
6181346 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
6181347 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede

6181354 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
6181355 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
6181356 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems

6181392 such provisions are often called force majeure clauses but attaching that label does not assist in our analysis we must look to the language that the parties specifically bargained for in the contract to determine the parties intent concerning whether the event complained of excuses performance
6181393 inconvenience or the cost of compliance though they might make compliance a hardship cannot excuse a party from the performance of an absolute and unqualified undertaking to do a thing that is possible and lawful parties bind themselves by their lawful contracts and courts cannot alter them because they work a hardship

6181404 cannery boat has become a great hit among young people as of 13 august 2008 shinchosha is said to have sold 1 561 000 copies of this 1929 marxist novel ed raising interest in marx even a television network is planning a show asking has capitalism reached its limit soliciting an answer from the communist party this is unprecedented a situation that our party has never experienced before
6181405 is this the reward for our sacrifices for the nation all these years
6181406 young people are not actively turning to the communist party videos of chairman shii hammering on the problem of contract labor have certainly made the rounds on the internet but the reality is probably that disgusted by the ruling party and unable to expect much from the democratic party people are supporting the communist party as a result of choice by elimination
6181407 there is no question that the rapid membership increase reflects the expansion of the ranks of the poor the party is attracting those who feel that they have been abandoned by the ruling party and the democratic party
6181408 the communist party has made it easier to join the party isnt it possible that many among the elderly joined the party out of support for particular representatives who helped them i say this because akahatas circulation hasnt grown
6181409 as mr shii says there is certainly a growing interest in marx but that doesnt necessarily translate into interest in socialism there are many who reject that i want to see what the communist party will do about this dilemma

6181426 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6181427 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded
6181428 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded

6181430 die olympischen spiele sind ein toller event es ist aufregend die athleten dabei zu beobachten wie sie um die goldmedaillen k mpfen ich habe gr ten respekt vor athleten wie michael phelps und usain bolt das sind die besten der besten
6181431 das team hat hart gearbeitet um f r das n chste rennen in valencia bereit zu sein das erste rennen des letzten saisonabschnitts von jetzt an ist jedes rennen extrem wichtig und jeder punkt wird einen gro en wert haben je weniger punkte noch zu vergeben sind desto wertvoller werden sie
6181432 ich kenne valencia denn wir haben hier im vergangenen winter ein paar mal getestet aber jetzt fahren wir auf einer neuen strecke in der stadt
6181433 die atmosph re wird sicher gro artig ich habe die strecke bisher nur auf onboardaufnahmen gesehen aber sie scheint f r einen stadtkurs sehr schnell zu sein ich liebe es auf neuen strecken zu fahren und ich lerne sie meist recht schnell ich kann valencia kaum noch erwarten
6181434 es gab einige rennen in denen es nicht gut f r mich lief aber aus irgendeinem grund konnte ich trotzdem wertvolle punkte sammeln meine position nach ungarn ist sogar besser als vor dem rennen wir haben noch nichts verloren aber wir brauchen bessere resultate und zwar konstant
6181435 ich denke der ausgang dieser weltmeisterschaft wird sehr eng sein ferrari und mclaren liegen in sachen performance sehr knapp beisammen und drei fahrer k nnen noch den titel holen
6181436 ich brauche nach dem letzten rennen mindestens um einen punkt mehr als meine konkurrenten das ist das einzige ziel alles andere sind belanglose details
6181437 brauchst du wie in montr al ein bisschen gl ck hoffentlich geht das rennen anders aus als in kanada
6181438 wir m ssen in valencia einen guten auftakt erwischen es ist dort wichtiger als auf anderen strecken schon am freitag mit kontinuit t arbeiten zu k nnen ich hoffe auf ein problemloses wochenende um das auto bestm glich abstimmen zu k nnen vor allem f r das qualifying das qualifying wird extrem wichtig auch wenn ich glaube dass man in valencia berholen kann
6181439 wenn es hei ist dann ist das gut f r ferrari

6181485 its also about the immortality of the soul thats the main subject for us since we started to play and release albums weve always talked about the same thing the soul
6181486 this albums got a more dramatic feel to it and some of the lyrics are almost cynical
6181487 usually with my lyrics im always positive but on this album im so pissed off with the situation on earth right now how were abusing so much and we take everything that we can take from the ocean and we kill off endangered species so in some of the songs its almost like a requiem for the earth this record is a lot darker like a lot darker i would say the music is darker and more violent
6181488 i think that probably some people will be disappointed by some things we did on this album but there is also a very logical evolution of our music since from mars to sirius its pretty much what we want to hear from a band and thats been our goal since the beginning to play music we could enjoy and for the first time we are happy with the sound weve achieved by being our own producers for all these years weve never had an external person telling us what to do and for the first time were very happy with the sound because its just so powerful
6181489 in recent weeks ricky martin became a proud father by the birth of twin sons

6181499 nick maggio right now unless something different happens will be our starting placekicker particularly anything with extra points or medium to close field goal range
6181500 throughout practice maggios percentage has been really good hes in the 85 percent range you can live with that in field goal range and hes 100 percent with extra points anything of any great distance wed certainly go back in there with joe
6181501 maggio has made a couple of 47 48 yarders so 45 yards and in im thinking him yesterday joe made one from 53 that would have been good from 63 hes a guy that has unusual ability weve got a guy whos truly a long range field goal kicker
6181502 in the event that a baby is aborted alive at christ hospital he or she is not given any medical care but is rather given what my hospital calls comfort care
6181503 comfort care is defined as keeping the baby warm in a blanket until the baby dies although until recently even this was not always done
6181504 one night a nursing coworker was taking an aborted down syndrome baby who was born alive to our soiled utility room because his parents did not want to hold him and she did not have time to hold him
6181505 i could not bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone in a soiled utility room so i cradled and rocked him for the 45 minutes that he lived
6181506 toward the end he was so quiet that i couldnt tell if he was still alive unless i held him up to the light to see if his heart was still beating through his chest wall after he was pronounced dead we folded his little arms across his chest wrapped him in a tiny shroud and carried him to the hospital morgue where all of our dead patients are taken

6181514 a sizable minority of americans find themselves at the intersection of these two long standing trends in news consumption integrators who get the news from both traditional sources and the internet are a more engaged sophisticated and demographically sought after audience segment than those who mostly rely on traditional news sources integrators share some characteristics with a smaller younger more internet savvy audience segment net newsers who principally turn to the web for news and largely eschew traditional sources
6181515 net newsers are the youngest of the news user segments median age 35 they are affluent and even better educated than the news integrators more than eight in ten have at least attended college net newsers not only rely primarily on the internet for news they are leading the way in using new web features and other technologies
6181516 since 2006 daily online news use has increased by about a third from 18 to 25
6181517 net newsers and integrators take advantage of a range of web features to get the news roughly four in ten 39 net newsers and about a third of integrators 32 have gotten a news story emailed to them in the past week and while 30 of net newsers regularly watch news online 19 regularly listen to news on the web
6181518 despite sweeping changes in the news landscape traditionalists remain the largest segment of the overall news audience compared with the integrators and net newsers traditionalists are downscale economically 43 are not employed and 60 have no more than a high school education

6181556 we have had the large spaces for hollywood films that we need to attract more projects to toronto
6181557 what filmport has done is provide exactly what hollywood studios have asked for
6181558 we brought a group of producers from of hollywoods biggest studios here earlier this year and they were very excited by what they saw
6181559 were going to finalize some of those deals and i expect something by the end of the year
6181560 its exciting for film people to look at all the details of the buildings these structures

6181566 theyve been slow to respond as mccain has successfully raised a series of questions about obamas basic fitness for the presidency

6181578 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6181579 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6181580 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6181581 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6181582 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6181583 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6181584 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket

6181589 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
6181590 not a herculean step were not claiming weve solved every problem the idea is that we make these kinds of choices on a regular basis about how we budget and manage our finances we will get ourselves back into a strong position

6181594 ncbs sponsorship of al qaeda flowed largely although not exclusively through muwafaq foundation
6181595 plaintiffs offer only speculation and hearsay in their effort to link ncb to al qaeda terrorists who committed the sept 11 attacks
6181596 mr kadis actions and those of his muwafaq foundation and businesses give rise to a reasonable basis to believe that they have facilitated terrorist activities

6181603 notorious for being focal and sporadic so finding one relatively small area that has higher transmission activity than other areas is more normal than abnormal

6181643 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6181644 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6181645 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small

6181688 in een schaakspel offer je ook wel eens een pion en kun je nog steeds winnen
6181689 en dat terwijl de uitgeverij er nog z op hamerde geen publiciteit voordat het boek daadwerkelijk in de winkel ligt
6181690 als ik zie wat ik allemaal gedaan zou moeten hebben in die periode dan was ik constant wakker geweest terwijl ik toch best veel heb geslapen
6181691 de afgelopen weken voelde ik me alsof ik in een rollercoaster zat daar ben ik natuurlijk zelf ingestapt door het versturen van de uitnodiging voor deze presentatie het ging op en neer ik werd door elkaar geschud hellingen werden steiler tot afgelopen donderdag toen ik er maar even uitstapte
6181692 nee geen spijt ik schrok wel van de ophef over de jaren tachtig door alle publiciteit zijn heel veel mensen op het verkeerde been gezet want ik beschrijf alleen in het eerste hoofdstuk wat ik heb meegemaakt als actievoerder ik wilde een representatief beeld geven van het soort dingen waarbij ik betrokken ben geweest die discussie over de jaren tachtig moet gevoerd worden al gaat het boek grotendeels over het klimaatprobleem
6181693 het voelt niet als offeren ik heb zelf een stapje opzij gedaan in een schaakspel offer je ook wel eens een pion en dan kun je nog steeds winnen
6181694 ik had nooit de intentie alles te beschrijven als ik dat wilde had ik een autobiografie moeten schrijven
6181695 ik besefte in de jaren tachtig dat je als actievoerder invloed kon uitoefenen dat je voor een deel je lot in eigen handen hebt dat heeft me ook zelfvertrouwen gegeven d t houdt me in deze periode op de been ik mis in de samenleving engagement passie mensen die ergens voor staan dat wilde ik in mijn boek aankaarten
6181696 er zijn ook heel foute dingen gebeurd ik heb geleerd dat het actievoeren van toen niet werkt als je verder wilt komen met het milieu ik heb mijn buren nodig zij moeten zich met de problematiek kunnen identificeren en dat kan niet als je gewelddadige acties voert
6181697 op de universiteit ging het verhaal dat je door te kraken betere woonruimte kon vinden ik kende studiegenoten die in verschillende buurten in amsterdam hadden gekraakt en dat was hen goed afgegaan
6181698 de politie hoort geduld te hebben zelfs als ze al drie keer met stenen bekogeld is de staatsmacht moet zich houden aan hogere grenzen zon keiharde houding leidt er eerder toe dat je wordt bevestigd in je gedrag dat was ook het moment waarop ik begon te radicaliseren
6181699 toen de me op me afkwam dacht ik wat is dit voor staat ik ben alleen met goede dingen bezig de gevangenis was voor mij een stimulans om door te gaan mijn acties voelden goed en belangrijk terugkijkend had de politie toen niet op ons moeten inhakken maar ons rustig moeten wegslepen geweld heeft zon enorme impact op je leven de keiharde houding van de politie leidt tot radicalisering pas daarmee op

6181701 ik kan me niet voorstellen dat mensen iets hebben van na mij de zondvloed dat ze denken we gaan de dijken ophogen en barst maar de vraag is of we op tijd zijn want we hebben heel veel haast maar als je ziet wat er technologisch allemaal kan dan is het een kwestie van de daad bij het woord voegen
6181702 je kunt mensen wel oproepen om geen jacuzzi te kopen maar dan denken ze ik ga dat niet in mijn eentje doen ik ben gekke henkie niet de politiek moet regels stellen niet alles kan maar je kunt niet zo vaak per jaar vliegen of zoveel vlees eten of in zulke grote autos rijden
6181703 ik had nooit het plan om nog een termijn in de politiek te blijven ik heb het zes jaar met al mijn ziel en zaligheid gedaan en wil het nu weer via maatschappelijke organisaties proberen
6181704 goed ik sta niet achter de katheder maar ik ben nog niet weg als iets me heeft geraakt de afgelopen weken zijn het de mensen die me steunen mensen sturen me e mails mooie gedichten champagne wijn laat je niet kisten zei onlangs in de supermarkt een vakkenvuller tegen me dat ontroert

6181785 jbfcs has invested time and talent to address eating disorders in the orthodox community in fact our boro park mbcs counseling center is the first of our clinics to have such a highly trained eating disorders specialist ariella rosenthal exactly because we see the issue as a crucial unmet need in this community we are proud to help fill that gap
6181786 our community has all of the same problems as the rest of the world weve just not chosen to deal with them until now
6181787 they did not wish to remain in israel while watching their countrymen suffer
6181788 they left when they saw that there was no longer a danger in tbliski even though there are political problems and it appears from the latest reports that the russians are not leaving our shluchim could not wait to get back on the plane
6181789 i have an explanation of this based upon jewish history
6181790 how could it be that jews who throughout their history have been persecuted for so many years by the church and by the muslims how do they have so much mesiras nefesh for torah and millions never even considered conversion or to succumb to the pressure the answer is that they could never even fathom another lifestyle other than the torah way of life the same can be said about our shlichim they cannot even fathom any way of life other than kiruv
6181791 there was a jewish community in gori and we had kiruv efforts there a building was being purchased so that we could build a new mikvah in gori now that russia had bombed gori 99 of the jewish residents of gori have fled to tblisi many are being cared for by the vaad this is one of the reasons that we have returned here now however we cannot continue the mikvah project but it is our hope that the project will continue when jewish life returns to gori
6181792 i became a baal teshuva at the age of nineteen
6181793 he was a tremendous tzaddik who gave selflessly of himself for yiddishkeit
6181794 well one set for me and one for my wife
6181795 they provide meat not only for tblisi but kosher consumers from across georgia receive meat orders from these stores
6181796 our efforts are not limited to tblisi and gori in azarbajan for example there is a small city called kuba not to be confused with the cuba south of the united states which is mostly jewish with many tea houses teahouses in azarbajan are similar to beer houses in germany people sit there and talk from morning to evening drinking tea we asked why cant our shlichim sit there and discuss torah we did this very successfully
6181797 the container has an enormous amount of food both for pesach and throughout the year we receive shmurah matzoh wine and grape juice and chometz food too we sell the chometz food and buy it back after pesach
6181798 there is no kosher pizza but in georgia there is something very similar available it is called chatshapuri it has a very tasty similar to pizza but it is shaped somewhat like a boureka although it tastes nothing like it but if introducing pizza will help our kiruv efforts it may be a good idea

6181822 everybody i talked to around the league told me about the city
6181823 they said it was a great place to live and raise a family the schools are great the fans are great it sounded like a good deal for me
6181824 they told me that its the kind of place that once you go there you just want to stay

6181827 i met him once when he first came up to the nhl and we played buffalo
6181828 i heard a lot of good things about him and we chatted a little bit at the red line he seems like a gentleman and an excellent goaltender i look forward to working with him
6181829 that was a big thing too being closer to family
6181830 there are tracks that were kicking around and brian is finishing up some lyrics and so on
6181831 it was not our initiative to put the group together or be part of the tour
6181832 we gave them a general overview of what was going on in the oil and gas industry very general kind of what we give to many other people when they are visiting

6181836 we have to determine what kind of money were talking about crystal lake just told me it will cost them an extra million

6181838 all the area legislators in lake and mchenry counties are in communication on this
6181839 to sit here in august and commit yourself to paying 145 to 165 a ton doesnt seem like much of a bargain for our towns unfortunately communities arent being given a lot of options
6181840 it could be a timing issue it could be a supply issue it could be people ordering more it could be a combination
6181841 as we understand this is a midwest problem it isnt specific to illinois
6181842 we had two extraordinarily severe winters back to back where the use of salt was extreme now we have huge demand and little supply

6181844 at least senator mccain is being honest a vote for him is a vote for the draft period unless senator mccain radically changes his worldview there would be a draft to implement his plans
6181845 when you take into account his indefinite military commitment to iraq his desire to send more troops to afghanistan record lows in recruiting and retention and possibly more wars he is looking to get into like
6181846 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory
6181847 emotionally honest friedman allows readers to experience things alongside him rather than merely gasp in awe at his heroics or sit clucking in judgment
6181848 a time to lead confirms the rewarding benefits of military service at a time when such service is experiencing considerable strain it also includes a comprehensive description of americas current national imperatives which deserve serious consideration

6181852 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the u s and the global economy
6181853 but declining customer satisfaction combined with weaker demand for u s exports may make it difficult for american households to shoulder the burden of being the locomotive for world economic growth
6181854 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts
6181855 this is not going to be helpful as the big three will lose more pricing power and be forced to continue dependence on rebates and discounting in a market where consumer preferences keep shifting away from domestic cars
6181856 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either

6181884 tracking down photographs for my book took a great deal of time
6181885 a big part was assuring people that i would take good care of their family photo albums and other related materials
6181886 after we talked for quite some time and i had gained her trust she pointed to an old dresser and told me to pull out a box which was stored beneath it

6181936 ele veio pra cima de mim com a faca e queria cortar minha barriga para ver a crian a
6181937 mas eu n o podia me separar dele tinha medo e n o podia sustentar meus filhos sozinha
6181938 n o s eu mas todo mundo no bairro comenta os homens ficaram com medo e as mulheres come aram a denunciar
6181939 isso mostra que as mulheres est o dando credibilidade lei pois os agressores est o sendo realmente presos
6181940 outro ponto que assegura as mulheres que os agressores n o est o sendo liberados logo al m disso somos extremamente criteriosos com a quest o da fian a
6181941 a pris o t surtindo efeito hoje temos muito mais ferramentas para punir o agressor que p ra a viol ncia quando percebe que vai ser punido

6181950 i dont think his training has given him enough speed endurance but eventually it will have and then i will be able to kiss my record goodbye
6181951 there was stage fright right there mate definitely stage fright
6181952 in the end you just have to see them as ordinary players you try to come out and put your best foot forward and see what happens
6181953 we felt that in this game that they were going to live and die by the 3 pointer
6181954 they made a couple we had a couple of defensive breakdowns but we took care of it thats the beauty of this team on the fly we can solve problems without having to call timeouts communication is a big weapon for us nobody is afraid to talk to one another because we all respect one another
6181955 with our team it always comes down to timely hits
6181956 we were often in scoring position but we forgot that we dont need to swing big because yukiko ueno provides the power
6181957 it was a nail biter that could have gone either way
6181958 this is probably the first beach volleyball match ive been nervous in before the match actually started

6181964 weve fought many matches against each other in pan american events and weve known each other for a long time we know each other strengths and weaknesses i thought i went the extra mile and put in the extra effort and when the judge approached us it crossed my mind that he would be inclined to raise the hand in my favor and it would be a great joy for my country
6181965 with the skills ive got i should beat him everyday
6181966 this time im going to use my brain and he shouldnt beat me
6181967 no one serves up a gold medal on a silver platter
6181968 i am responsible for making a breakthrough in sailing for the chinese
6181969 at the beginning of the regatta things werent going very well for me but i was mentally prepared for such events and i would not give up until the very end
6181970 it is a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before
6181971 we have played them twice world league 2008 and world championships 2007 and we have beaten them twice
6181972 i expect the same we did not play our best here one goal can decide the game

6181991 chapter 6 on page 42 the narrator seconds the questioners thought that quoting or taking elements of other older literature creates a form of authority for their own work im not trying to disagree with that to me that seems quite logical but it got me thinking if we extract credible genius from established works in order to further merit our own writing why is it that we dont just read all of the established credible books rather than modern books that seem to only have power through these older texts im not trying to say that these older books should be the be all and end all im merely remarking on the apparent fact that there are enough books in existence to try and replicate the old genius for this kind of statement to show up in this book

6181994 the chief thing about the subject of education is that it is not a subject at all there is no such thing as education the thing is merely a loose phrase for the passing on to others of whatever truth or virtue we happen to have ourselves
6181995 it is typical of our time that the more doubtful we are about the value of philosophy the more certain we are about the value of education that is to say the more doubtful we are about whether we have any truth the more certain we are apparently that we can teach it to children

6182009 overall 223 190 students received corporal punishment in 2006 07 according to the statistics that number is down from 342 038 students in 2000 01 as more and more districts abolished corporal punishment
6182010 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6182011 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6182012 parents get angry when theyre spanking and its not working
6182013 if a child gets spanked so often they just dont care anymore and will misbehave anyway

6182020 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6182021 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6182022 by going to invesco field at mile high we doubled the number of boxes and that has helped dramatically that and having the candidate have been a big difference
6182023 snc lavalin would like to extend its deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and to those who are currently being treated in a local hospital
6182024 snc lavalin is proud of its longstanding relationship with the people of algeria and of the many projects we have carried out together over more than 30 years we continue to work closely with algerian authorities to ensure the safety and security of all our personnel
6182025 if i was holding the auction i would definitely want to hold it soon after this olympics
6182026 we didnt bid last time and i dont think a lot has changed
6182027 it validates the belief we had 10 years ago or more that sports fans are not just enjoying sports on television
6182028 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6182029 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6182030 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6182031 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6182032 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6182033 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6182034 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6182035 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6182036 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6182037 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6182038 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6182039 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6182040 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6182041 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6182042 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6182043 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6182044 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6182045 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6182046 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6182047 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6182048 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6182049 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6182050 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6182051 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6182052 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6182053 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6182054 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6182055 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6182056 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6182057 pelo n vel de participa o e da anima o dos participantes dessa vez a gente leva
6182058 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6182059 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6182060 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6182061 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6182062 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6182063 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6182064 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6182065 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6182066 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6182067 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6182068 until that issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6182069 to me the market has now recognized that oil services stocks and equipment stocks sold off more than they should have
6182070 now they are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6182071 until that issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6182072 to me the market has now recognized that oil services stocks and equipment stocks sold off more than they should have
6182073 now they are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6182074 had it not been for my own prodigious skill and for professor snapes timely action when i returned to hogwarts desperately injured i might not have lived to tell the tale
6182075 i am a sufficiently accomplished legilimens myself to know when i am being lied to
6182076 your mother could have whipped that potion up with her eyes closed
6182077 dont be concerned about the voter address on the website its the secret code that will get you club level access at invesco field
6182078 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6182079 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6182080 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6182081 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6182082 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6182083 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6182084 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6182085 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6182086 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6182087 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6182088 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6182089 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6182090 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6182091 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6182092 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6182093 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6182094 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6182095 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6182096 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6182097 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6182098 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6182099 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6182100 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6182101 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6182102 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6182103 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6182104 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6182105 who are open to doing something on the production side
6182106 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6182107 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6182108 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6182109 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6182110 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6182111 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6182112 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6182113 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6182114 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6182115 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6182116 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6182117 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6182118 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6182127 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6182128 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6182129 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6182130 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6182143 everyone knows that bohs problem last year was scoring goals and bringing jason in should help in that regard
6182144 it is a big boost to have him signed because he is a proven goalscorer and with him and glen weve the two best strikers in the league in recent years
6182145 seventy nine goals over two years is not a bad return for two fellas who werent supposed to be able to play together is it
6182146 when shels won the title in 2006 they were the top two scorers in the league and they played extremely well together
6182147 ok glen might not have scored as many as he had when he was at bohs the first time but he worked extremely hard and played a huge role they are two natural scorers and i am sure they are looking forward to linking up with each other again
6182148 but there is no guarantee that they will play every week because darren mansaram did well last year and there might be some games in which we go with only one up front
6182149 the competition for places will be good because it will keep all of them on their toes

6182151 it was terrible to see him booed by the irish on one side and then go over to the english side and be cheered roy is a great irish international and did not deserve that
6182152 i couldnt believe it you might expect that from a player or maybe even someone on the staff but not from the manager of the club especially when a school backs on to the ground
6182153 the thing is we were more inclined to believe des than se n and that shows how little trust we had in him

6182161 meeting this delivery commitment on time helps ensure that the f 35c lightning ii will begin flight test on schedule in 2009 this important step is vital to our commitment to fielding the f 35c for the u s navy as planned in 2015
6182162 the f 35 carrier variant will give the navy a powerful multi role strike fighter that can begin to assume the duties of the f a 18 hornet a b c d aircraft that have been successfully protecting and extending the reach of the u s fleet since 1983

6182224 he said that im questioning his patriotism let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6182225 the bottom line is that senator obamas words for all of their eloquence and passion doesnt mean all that much and thats the problem with washington
6182226 its not just the bush administration and its not just the democratic congress its that everybody in washington says whatever it takes to get elected or to score the political point of the day we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving we need to start putting our country first

6182412 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
6182413 endeavouring to cause prospective defendants to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony

6182418 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
6182419 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties

6182431 i think his unbidden guidance represents a sort of up selling that isnt as quickly noticed as the aggressive promotion of specialty cocktails the belligerent hawking of brussels sprouts and whipped potatoes the evangelism for dessert

6182440 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
6182441 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
6182442 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
6182443 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
6182444 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit

6182506 shit man does everything have to be about nam with you
6182507 its a government test of what theyre gonna do to that camelfucker in iraq
6182508 saddam wont know what hit him besides too many dissidents here the government is making an example of us
6182509 man that is so uncool you dont know what youre talking about walter
6182510 but who here has intimate knowledge of the us military as i recall you were a non combatant in viet nam so who knows what the government is capable of dude whos seen it with his own two eyes am i wrong
6182511 i just dont think the government would block out the sun walter
6182512 like its my opinion that it would be very uncool of them besides if the government did it who the hell are the guys who keep stalking the parking lot the ones who suck blood
6182513 genetically altered shock troops thats why they blocked out the sun dude
6182514 saddam and his buddy osama wont know what hit em
6182515 and that those guys in the parking lot are american soldiers
6182516 so have any of the shock troops tried to eat you
6182517 i think they were drunk i offered them a j and they got off my case particularly when they noticed the outfit like its cool i explained that it wasnt really my idea of a good time to be eaten and they like decided that was a good idea a couple of em are thinking about joining the league and its like right on
6182518 its bowling and like thats the secret of the universe you know

6182529 that the slayer can bust your balls without breakin a nail
6182530 its how hard you get and that soul makes it soft soft like dear sweet wes
6182531 it must do your head in wanting me to hate that english boy of yours all the while knowing that ive had the slayer more times than you could ever imagine heard her call my name while she was flexed around my cock had her so many ways that youd trade it all for just one night but if youre happy with your new boy be my guest
6182532 well maybe just a little its okay spike ill take it out of you later
6182533 im not here for the beer or the clientele and youre clearly here for me mate so why dont we fuck off with the games and take this outside

6182544 angelus do remember to love the one youre with or you can find another wanker to shag on the hood of your car xander might go for it if you get him really drunk and convince him it doesnt make him gay
6182545 id have to be pretty fucking desperate to fuck harris
6182546 itd take him a week just to learn how to give a proper blowjob
6182547 i dunno his ex was demanding i bet you could train him fast

6182555 m nniskor kan indelas i tv grupper en som g r f re och utr ttar n got och den som kommer efter och kritiserar
6182556 why is there a large silver tour bus parked across the street
6182557 too much estrogen in the house and the eau de nerd is giving me the creeps
6182558 how are you now that we know youre not the first and all
6182559 yes its rather a relief to know that ones friends and colleagues can rest easily knowing that im alive and touchable
6182560 im still rather flummoxed that you lot even considered it
6182561 well maybe if you werent so standoffish and aloof we could have remembered the touching
6182562 were in the middle of an event unlike anything in known history anya
6182563 pardon me for not making with the good touch as xander might say
6182564 if its the end of the world isnt it about the time we do more hugging and physical reassuring than usual i mean all those girls in there are touching an awful lot and i dont think its in a repressed sexual manner like it might be for xander and andrew
6182565 i was always rather unsure who angel fancied more buffy or xander
6182566 dont you think that if the worlds going to end we should be more touchy feely for example you clearly came out here to make sure my emotional state wasnt being affected by all the chaos inside id feel a lot better if you did that while holding my hand or touching my shoulder
6182567 but i think im just trying to follow your advice
6182568 please dont say anything ridiculous about de stressing or relaxing
6182569 well if thats the way you feel about it fine go away giles i can relax without you thats for sure
6182570 you made a pass at me anya how is that in any way relaxing
6182571 well maybe if you kissed back it would have been relaxing
6182572 i think youre wound up over watching all the mini buffys and no ones paying attention to you
6182573 im too young or maybe too blunt and ex demony or youre afraid this has to do with getting back at xander for flirting with andrew
6182574 on the contrary i was rather thinking that i liked your hair that color
6182575 and that well have to look into the tour bus just in case that little prats right and it is the bus of the undead or some such rot
6182576 especially if it means i dont have to listen to slayers in training train or make out with willow
6182577 then it would be relatively agreed that we should pay attention to each other
6182578 so bus of the undead followed by a discreet make out session somewhere less prone to hordes of pubescent girls walking by windows
6182579 he doesnt use all that computer e bay myspace social networking shite
6182580 train youll have to walk from here we will follow you even if you cannot see us we will be with you that is one of our abilities
6182581 well talk more about it later it still may not be safe here
6182582 youre the one who called me and you dont know that youre safe have a little faith in your abilities train leifgart
6182583 you are here because you called me youve quite piqued my interest you seem to not be a part of my realm but i can hear your voice this is the second time youve called me and the second time ive saved your life
6182584 something that is quite restricted in this realm something that is meant only for gods your voice is booming when you call out to us its seems to be a call i cannot resist im not your enemy or your friend but i still feel compelled to help you in this realm i am the goddess of death each time you called me you were on the verge of dying your spirit was spent your life completely drained even now your physical form in your realm barely hangs to life
6182585 im still new to this so i am unsure of what exactly im doing
6182586 just so long as you entertain me i want to hear stories of your world ive been here so long that the trivial quarrels of a world whose gods and humans are at war are becoming the droll of my existence i cannot leave this place anymore and the stories i hear here are the same nothing ever new comes and i am forced to live a meaningless existence please call on me whenever you need help
6182587 dont trust everyone you call i can tell you that not everyone that comes to you will have your best ideas in their mind now go through the doorway behind you to wake up and tell the orange haired girl thanks for staying with me that time
6182588 you were all amazing back there mikan mister and miss hanakage and yuri thank you all for helping me
6182589 there was nothing i could do you werent breathing your heart had stopped youve been that way for three hours it seems that calling out takes allot of mana and you ended up sacrificing too much of your life force to make up for the mana you didnt have we were on our way to the freemasons guild right now to see if a more powerful healer could revive you
6182590 dont ever do that again i cant lose another friend and you promised
6182591 im sorry for any trouble that ive put you all through
6182592 they have been taken in by the guild for treatment just a few bumps and bruises nothing to serious you should see them within a week or so
6182593 i found them still in the kitchen so i contacted the guild
6182594 and why didnt we just wait and have train on the copter as well
6182595 i was confident in the boys abilities yes thats it
6182596 this is just speculation based on what ive heard and seen
6182597 but i believe you have the power to call forth beings from other planes like your summoning them to your aid also from what ive seen it takes a very great deal of mana my wife said your mana pool was quite large but for example summoning this fox child to help you exhausts you to the point of death
6182598 mikan is a full grown woman who can fulfill all of her masters wishes
6182599 they still havent matured to that point if you know what i mean
6182600 lets get moving we still have a ways to go train yuri mikan you all should rest
6182601 you can use mikans lap for a pillow if you please
6182602 train should sleep how he was when he was dead with his head on my lap
6182603 i think ill sleep sitting if you two dont mind
6182604 train leifgart a boy from another realm whose voice is so loud that it can be heard hear in niffleheim
6182605 baldur october ive made a new friend someone from a realm completely separated from our own yet i could hear him calling out my name asking for help he was on the verge of death both times i was wondering would you like to meet him and are you willing to help him his situation is very similar to how yours was
6182606 yes i would do anything to help a friend of yours
6182607 it is with me as it is with baldur i will help you my liege
6182608 i cannot say when he will call out to me again so be prepared
6182609 weve been doing this too long the norns have left us ragnarok is here and we cannot stop surt alone but maybe this could be the key
6182610 si certo che disponibile ma non abbiamo due stanze singole abbiamo un salone grande x due persone ci stanno bene
6182611 jam s he tenido compromisos con grupos paramilitares jam s los promov y jam s me ayudaron
6182612 yo llevo este apellido con mucho honor no quiero atribuir a ese apellido consecuencias por algunos actos de mi vida
6182613 son una mentira y eso contribuy para que resolviera mi situaci n
6182614 you take care of employees theyll take care of the business
6182615 you would be surprised at how willing others are to pitch in
6182616 if you really need a full time person you need to be clear on that
6182617 otherwise then the individual begins coming in at 10 and leaving at 2 most days leaving lots of work undone
6182618 as the boss you say you need to tell me if you cant do this
6182619 thats a sign we should sit and talk about this
6182620 you need to treat them like adults even though theyre adults in pain
6182621 the return can be so huge for a small company in improved productivity and reduced turnover
6182622 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6182623 i feel very sad and angry because were only asking for the basic right of living and its been six years but nobody will do anything to help them
6182624 la consternaci n y el profundo dolor de toda la delegaci n espa ola
6182625 sus condolencias y solidaridad a los familiares de las v ctimas del accidente
6182626 i know theyre watching us here i got an idea
6182627 we might have to disband this family so that i can take him for myself
6182628 and relax hes not my husband you dolts he is my well friend however and his full name is train leifgart
6182629 heimdall was my father but i dont know anything about my parents though
6182630 he was able to take my mind reading by kissing me
6182631 you know a mothers lips are more trained than a daughters
6182632 they must not want you to get hurt even though it was in inevitability that youd find your powers sooner or later what other abilities do you have
6182633 youll need to go to school to find your true abilities why dont you go with yuri shell be leaving after she graduates grade school but yuri if he does go with you we may end up fighting over him
6182634 im not to sure if my grandparents will be to happy about that
6182635 theyre planning on moving away to the other side of the city by then
6182636 well talk to them for you well whose up for lunch
6182637 so train do you want to hear about the freemasons
6182638 a very important part in fact the name leifgart is sure to catch some high ranking attention for you but you sure have big shoes to fill while much of what youre parents were doing at the end is a mystery to most of us and there are no public records available of it the freemason leadership immediately named them heroes they also say that what they did may have saved the world as we know it
6182639 the freemasons are an organization that operates independently of the government and is tightly under wraps the government once tried to erase us from the history books but our mark is undeniable we are in no way against the government nor do we go around committing crimes but we do help the government from time to time with special matters that and operating in secrecy is what keeps us around you could actually say that we are a part of the government that no one can see
6182640 it all depends on what the times call for for example right now its very calm and were researching our abilities trying to find ways to impose them on machines in other words a laptop that can connect to the internet through its users abilities much more data can be handled thusly and it doesnt take any draw making it virtually free oh dear ive gone on a rant again
6182641 hes head of the research and development team he basically makes magical devices to make our lives easier
6182642 what if i may ask do you do for them miss hanakage
6182643 train this school is special all great freemasons start there you will be living on campus in a
6182644 our daughter is going there too shell be in a co ed dorm whatll happen to my daughter
6182645 however they also have a special course in determining abilities and powers you will be put through the ringer though a famous mages son is expected to have something special
6182646 the course will put you in situations where your abilities will naturally come out
6182647 last year i had to do allot of healing i even had to reattach an arm
6182648 please tell him the truth actually never mind i will the truth is thanks to my dads research this part of the process is all done with computers and holograms its as harmless as taking a bath
6182649 i just had the funniest thought of yuri slipping and falling into the tub
6182650 i only wish to keep him alive he called me here for that purpose it looks like he sacrificed some of his life for some reason
6182651 you guys werent even breathing i tried to heal but i couldnt find anything wrong
6182652 train i think we just found another one of your powers mom dad it is as you say he is something special he has a power ive never heard of before there was a fox and it asked him if he needed help and he changed it then the fox died
6182653 and he sacrificed life for extra mana and a white haired girl came
6182654 im not sure if ive heard of this power either we will not let you not go to school with yuri your grandparents know what will happen if you dont go you will be hunted and silenced by a certain faction with a power that great it wont be long before they find you lets go meet your grandparents

6182657 this was a trial for the summer and it appears to be going very well
6182658 so this will give organizers a chance to build on that success and to also allow the students to participate

6182697 theres no other explanation for this happening lets ditch the rest of the day and go see my parents the sooner this happens the better
6182698 i would add this question how long have you been in the geographic area and how well known is your brand typically a prospect will not take off part of his her day unless they have heard of you you have credibility and or your content and agenda is compelling enough for them to take a risk and sacrifice hours of productivity at work for your event people are too busy to leave the office and your event better be worth it
6182699 are you a known entity and would they come to see you
6182700 i would add this question how long have you been in the geographic area and how well known is your brand typically a prospect will not take off part of his her day unless they have heard of you you have credibility and or your content and agenda is compelling enough for them to take a risk and sacrifice hours of productivity at work for your event people are too busy to leave the office and your event better be worth it

6182702 this is continued evidence that the initiatives and programs to protect workers safety and health designed by and implemented in this administration are indeed working
6182703 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
6182704 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
6182705 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
6182706 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
6182707 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
6182708 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well

6182713 all countries where appropriate should develop and implement resettlement programmes that address the specific problems of displaced populations in their respective countries
6182714 participating eligible communities flood insurance may be written only in those communities that have been designated as participating in the national flood insurance program nfip by the federal emergency management agency fema
6182715 prior to the creation of the nfip floodplain management as a practice was not well established only a few states and several hundred communities actually regulated floodplain development
6182716 since the federal government does not have land use authority the nfip is based on the federal governments power to spend under the constitution rather than any federal authority to regulate land use
6182717 under the nfip regulations participating nfip communities are required to regulate all development in sfhas
6182718 when a community chooses to join the nfip it must adopt and enforce minimum floodplain management standards for participation
6182719 floodplain management refers to an overall community program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing future flood damage these measures generally include zoning subdivision or building requirements and special purpose floodplain ordinances
6182720 no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided unless an appropriate public body shall have adopted adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions which the director finds are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use
6182721 if a community chooses not to participate flood insurance is not available from the nfip moreover if a president declares a disaster as a result of flooding federal financial assistance will not be available for the permanent repair or reconstruction of insurable buildings
6182722 communities must ensure that their adopted floodplain management ordinance and enforcement procedures meet program requirements local regulations must be updated when additional data are provided by fema or when federal or state standards are revised
6182723 all countries where appropriate should develop and implement resettlement programmes that address the specific problems of displaced populations in their respective countries
6182724 after the great flood of 1993 thousands of properties in flood plains around the midwest were bought out by the government now weeks after the latest massive flood buyouts are again being considered in at least five states missouri iowa wisconsin indiana and illinois residents in areas that qualify can choose to sell their properties to their city or county with 75 percent of the costs paid by the federal emergency management agency communities that use the fema dollars agree to demolish structures on the properties and not develop the land except for recreational use such as parks
6182725 despite the wide array of tools and techniques to operationalize the principles of sustainable development
6182726 ironically the time immediately following a natural disaster provides a community with a unique window of opportunity for inserting an ethic of sustainability in guiding development and redevelopment in high risk areas with forethought and planning communities that are rebuilt in the aftermath of a natural hazard can be built back so that they are more resiliant to future hazards breaking the pattern of repeated hazard destruction rebuilding at the same time the community is given the opportunity to incorporate other attributes of sustainability into its second chance development such as energy efficiency affordable housing use of recycled building materials reduction of water use and environmental protection

6182754 do young people model their behaviour on the a dult delinquents
6182755 the reason for the lack of public outrage is because the whole system so strongly favours the aspirational and manipulative middle and professional classes who are the ones who would normally be making the most noise against it
6182756 charles 1 of england was willing to promote civil war to uphold the divine right of kings
6182757 they preferred the ancient light of divinely blessed authority to the distant glimmer of democracy

6182763 it is probably true that in general the higher the education of the individual becomes the more their views are differentiated if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and common taste prevail this does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards it is as it were the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people

6182858 that sense of justice and equality expressed by george truett is a guiding principle
6182859 it starts at the top and works its way down it makes a difference when it comes to making decisions about how to a doctor visits a child in hillcrest health systems neonatal intensive care unit allocate resources as a mission based organization that enjoys tax exempt status its expressed in our commitment to take care of the medically underserved population

6182862 as you know most of the bad debt is generated by persons who dont qualify for charity or dont provide the information to confirm that they do but dont have the ability to pay either the entire bill or the portion that is their responsibility even if they have insurance
6182863 this problem is growing annually as many employers are either dropping coverage raising the employee premiums to unaffordable levels or increasing the co pays and deductibles to amounts which most people are not able to pay
6182864 baylors community benefit expenditures in fiscal year 2006 accounted for nearly 21 3 percent of its net patient revenue reaching a record 407 million in unreimbursed costs the vast majority or nearly 395 million of the expenditure went to provide care for charity patients and patients enrolled in government programs such as medicare and medicaid payments from these federal and state agencies are far below the actual cost of the care delivered the remaining 12 million provided for unreimbursed costs of medical education and research as well as more than 200 community benefit programs

6182942 if this does not work our people will follow him musharraf wherever he goes and whenever they find a chance theyll kill him or get hold of him alive
6182943 for clearing the area of the terrorists if it just so happened that somebody else was there and he was killed he cant be held responsible for murder

6182953 we can take plenty of positives into our first qualifier against georgia
6182954 we created some good chances in the first period but the conditions ruined the game in the second half as there was no fluidity to the play and it became a lottery
6182955 things are looking good for our first world cup qualifier in georgia and i am confident that we can do well

6182970 the christian faith does not possess in its nature the means for analyzing the structure of capitalism marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality and thereby help christians to see how things really are

6182975 export business for beef and lamb is important to scotland and if we are a significant distance from the outbreak then a case can be made for some aspect of regionalisation

6182978 this is early days in a rapidly moving situation but we need to see as quickly as possible animals going direct from farms into the food chain under licence
6182979 however obviously this can only happen if the disease control experts are happy to let it
6182980 their action for example to lift the ban on burying animals on farms in light of the suspension of pick up services is a good example of the cabinet secretary and his officials working extremely quickly and in close harmony with industry
6182981 hopefully if this virus has been contained we can get agriculture back to normal

6183305 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year

6183307 ive got three applications on my iphone right now that dont work apple killed the netshare application why did that do that is apple enforcing at amp t s terms of service i didnt sign a contract with apple that allows them to do that
6183308 let me buy what i want and its my problem if i run afoul of at amp t
6183309 the implications are a falling stock price thats what they are afraid of
6183310 lets say apple sold 2 5 million iphone 3gs theyd better make 2 5 million iphones with a fix in it before they announce the recall because you are going to have 2 5 million people wanting another iphone theyd better have them in stock

6183318 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6183319 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6183320 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain

6183379 old mines like the orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever
6183380 most mines today are above the water table which makes chances of leakage practically nil what we have now is a well regulated industry
6183381 we already have the clean water act the national environmental policy act and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done so there wont be impacts to the environment
6183382 at this time were still evaluating plans on an individual basis but a regional study is not something i can rule out
6183383 we hear from the industry and federal government that today we can do it safely
6183384 but thats not the way we do things today we understand and know a lot more about uranium radium and radon and the impacts of those so to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison
6183385 when you take uranium and the other trace elements out of their resting places in nature and expose them to the environment
6183386 you expose them in higher concentrations to the environment and intensify their effects people dont appreciate the cumulative impact of mining in a consolidated area theres a very real threat
6183387 they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs

6183390 let me be crystal clear charter oak and husky are going ahead on time and on schedule period
6183391 they oppose charter oak because what they really want is universal health care at any cost and they know that cost is 17 billion a year which connecticut taxpayers neither want nor can afford
6183392 if you want connecticut physicians to provide care to charter oak health plan enrollees your administration should work with the legislature and connecticut physician organizations to offer a plan which reimburses physicians at rates which are market competitive and do not put physicians in economic jeopardy
6183393 the amount of funding doesnt allow it to pay commercial rates
6183394 more than 6 000 people have already applied for charter oak and i am going to make sure they get coverage
6183395 i will not allow a tiny minority of legislators to deny people the health care coverage they desperately need
6183396 enrollees do not have to make a decision to change insurers or stay where they are until late november
6183397 our customer service staff will provide whatever assistance is needed
6183398 unfortunately not everyone seems to appreciate the fact that charter oak is the most important health care initiative in connecticut since husky was created a decade ago to go backward now would be harmful to the connecticut taxpayers who have applied for coverage in a program that was after all approved by the general assembly

6183441 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6183442 last week raised important questions about whether barack obama is strong enough to be president
6183443 this two dimensional portrait of weakness underscores fears that obama might indeed be a latter day jimmy carter

6183445 health care reform is a divisive issue in washington but there is wide agreement on one solution to lower costs and improve care
6183446 obviously the benefits of health it go far beyond patient convenience
6183447 something as simple as another doctors illegible handwriting or an improperly transcribed note can cause a patient to get less than ideal care
6183448 balance is required between protecting patient privacy and giving health care professionals access to patient medical information
6183449 offers better security for private medical information through high tech firewalls and secure data encryption
6183450 increased efficiency in treatment made possible by health it will also help contain rising health care costs
6183451 a major concern for business owners like me who offer health care coverage
6183452 manufacturers who provide health coverage spend an average of 2 38 per worker per hour on health care costs
6183453 spiraling health care costs have forced many manufacturers to tighten their budgets making it difficult or impossible to expand
6183454 if congress doesnt act to rein in these costs american companies will be forced to either scale back on health benefits or shift manufacturing jobs overseas in order to compete
6183455 women who have abortions have no greater risk of mental health problems than if they carry the pregnancy to term
6183456 comes very close to embracing the full reproductive health agenda
6183457 been consistently advocated by the pro choice progressive womens movement
6183458 loose coalition of progressive evangelicals and catholics held a press event to toot their own horn
6183459 not only is the new platform stronger in its support for the right to choose abortion it embraces the concept of reproductive justice including not only family planning but comprehensive sexuality education
6183460 it became clear that other than vague support for women who choose to continue pregnancies and caring adoption laws there was next to nothing in the plank these folks supported
6183461 certain that the quiet experienced voices of pro choice leaders carried far more weight than democrats and fellow travelers who oppose a womans right to decide whether abortion or childbearing and rearing is the best moral decision they can make
6183462 californias anti choice groups have put forth what has become a traditional anti choice attack a parental notification measure that is designed to chip away at access to abortion
6183463 again attempting an outright abortion ban a measure that is designed to challenge roe v wade in the supreme court
6183464 vote on a new extreme measure that would define a persons life as beginning at fertilization outlawing not just abortions but also emergency contraception and birth control
6183465 altogether the three bans represent a multi pronged attack on choice appearing on the ballot this november while in 2006 all eyes were on south dakota this fall reproductive rights activists have three states to watch

6183474 there were only five biosafety level 4 labs places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment a government accountability office report stated last fall fifteen are in operation or under construction now according to the report there are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs which handle agents such as bacillus anthracis which does have a human vaccine
6183475 clearances to work with select biological agents such as bacillus anthracis many of them civilians working at private universities
6183476 build a larger laboratory complex as part of a proposed interagency biodefense campus at fort detrick

6183478 to make sure that the virus that causes smallpox would remain in storage awaiting a new opportunity to terrorize the world for decades both countries stored it distributed it to various research labs and otherwise ensured that this public health victory would be turned into a potential human tragedy
6183479 fear of smallpox has played nicely into the overall strategy of the bush administration to militarize public health
6183480 the unresolved story of abc news false saddam anthrax reports
6183481 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6183482 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6183483 we reiterate that fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment
6183484 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here

6183493 the classes of the community most addicted to the habitual use of cocaine are the parasites who live on the earnings of prostitutes prostitutes of the lowest order and young degenerates who acquire the habit at an early age through their connection with prostitutes and parasites
6183494 nowadays drugs have become a regular diet with harlots and their pimps and criminally inclined persons of all kinds
6183495 in many instances heroin addicts are members of gangs who congregate on street corners particularly at night and make insulting remarks to people who passed
6183496 most addicts acquired the habit through the physical disease or discomfort today the number of new addictions through physicians prescriptions is small the great majority of cases now result from association with other addicts following their advice in taking a shot or a sniff for what ails you and searching for new sensations these are the pleasure users
6183497 a proportion of our doctors and a much larger ratio of our druggists regard their liberty to prescribe and sell as a license to advise and furnish to its victims the narcotic curse on demand
6183498 the contrast between european and american professional ethics in this matter is deplorable and the dark side of the picture is americas
6183499 a protest by women in part of their lack of civil rights women could not vote in most states women could not have control of their property or custody of their children in case of divorce there were no legal protections for women and children prosecutions for rape were rare and the state regulated age of consent was as low as seven
6183500 at the end of the 19th century americans spent over a billion dollars on alcoholic beverages each year compared with 900 million on meat and less than 200 million on public education
6183501 it was what appears to be a rogue operation its definitely concerning that we have an element that would go do something like that

6183512 meeting community needs has always been a priority and hallmark of the community foundation
6183513 the air conditioner has really been a blessing i so appreciate it it has made my recovery less painful and breathing much more comfortable thank you
6183514 obtaining the air conditioner from the community foundation was a big deal for me and my family besides the air conditioner just knowing that someone cared and was reaching out thats what counts
6183515 well any choice you make for vice president has pros and cons thatll be true for senator obama and senator mccain
6183516 it would seem to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell and i have traveled to thousands of places last year a one issue party and that would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party but i believe the party will support senator mccains choice
6183517 you certainly want to give yourself the best chance to win i know from talking to john mccain about this not just now but in the past when we both used to think about choosing a vice president when we were opponents that our main criteria would be a person who would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone who could immediately be president of the united states
6183518 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6183519 actually my understanding is that yesterday fox news reported the r n c said mccain is no longer considering any candidates who are pro choice to your knowledge is that incorrect
6183520 we could do a call all day about senator mccains v p choices frankly were not talking about senator mccains v p choices until he makes a v p choice
6183521 actually i dont have any representations with the saudis thats incorrect
6183522 and i never represented citgo in negotiations with the chavez government so both of those are factually inaccurate
6183523 bloomberg reported that your law firm lobbied for huge chavez at citgo is that not correct
6183524 it is not correct that i had negotiations with chavezs government
6183525 it is correct that my law firm for many many years it doesnt any longer represented citgo an american corporation but it had nothing to do with chavez
6183526 and you never represented saudi arabias oil ministry in a texas court case
6183527 another indication of the inexperience senator obama has in conducting foreign policy
6183528 es importante este encuentro porque es una forma de levantar la voz los j venes y que seamos escuchados porque a nosotros s se nos tiene olvidados no contamos con beneficios que cuentan los mestizos hacer esta actividad nos cuesta trabajo porque no contamos con los recursos suficientes y pretendemos hacer fuerza para que los acuerdos que se tomen en las mesas de trabajo sean escuchados

6183538 we feel that we have a strong enough studio selection that we can do our studios better justice by selling direct to retail
6183539 in other territories where we do direct to retail our sales are proportionally higher than in the u s under the old method i think were going to be proven correct
6183540 retailers dont like shipping charges but everybody has to incur shipping and its a part of the business what we do is add some dvds to the shipment to help offset the costs
6183541 we always expected to do well in new releases but were going to win or lose this battle in the catalog end of the business
6183542 it was very difficult for a retailer to get catalog because it was a cumbersome process
6183543 retailers are really liking the fact that we can tell them exactly what we have and we can ship it out to them right away thats a big big plus
6183544 nobody likes change but a lot of times change is for the better and this is definitely better
6183545 its going to be better for us but its also going to be better for them
6183546 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
6183547 we feel that we can do our studios better justice by selling direct to retail

6183572 at times i worry about how im going to pay my credit cards
6183573 it doesnt look like theres a lot of change but 25 percent of people are spending less on living expenses
6183574 when you dont have much money the first thing that gets cut is eating out
6183575 one consistent pattern i see is that people earning less than 75 000 report spending less than the previous month
6183576 specifically those who have one to three cards report this decrease in spending but those who have four or more cards do not
6183577 this may indicate that the curtailing of expenditure reported by respondents who earn less than 75 000 was driven by availability of credit
6183578 my hypothesis here is that people who have four or more credit cards have more available credit
6183579 it seems that among married couples women are more likely to want money in the bank perhaps for an emergency even though there are credit card balances
6183580 studies have shown women tend to be more risk averse
6183581 they tend to be the primary caregivers in terms of all health care issues for the family and they tend to be the primary shopper for the family
6183582 i could never tell you what the interest rate on my credit card is because i pay it off at the end of the month
6183583 youre going to have to cut back somewhere or youre going to have to put it on credit cards
6183584 you may be relying on your credit card for more of your daily expenses and when the end of the month comes you may be unable to pay it off
6183585 people that are interested in this are the people that are more at risk
6183586 over 30 percent of the people dont pay attention thats scary
6183587 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children

6183605 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6183606 he did everything right he was a kid we liked and it was very unfortunate
6183607 the way it worked out theres a chance when he gets healthy that we can bring him back later in the season we felt like we dealt with him fairly and he did a fantastic job for us
6183608 i think depth wise were fine but you are always looking to improve the quality of your team
6183609 its day to day and when i get on the field depends on the trainers but i felt pretty good being able to run out here for the first time
6183610 i hope to get a lot of those guys back on monday but whether that comes to reality or not i dont know yet thats up to the medical people
6183611 the key is hes caught passes from a lot of good quarterbacks
6183612 not to take anything away from the timing you have with your own quarterback i would prefer he be out there and so would he but the reality is hasnt been but we saw quite a bit of him in the otas and in camp before the injury were just hoping to get him back out there as soon as possible
6183613 how long they will play in the third quarter will be based on how many reps theyve gotten
6183614 we have an adage that people live up or down to expectations
6183615 weve had high expectations for him hes met those until we get into the regular season and really get any kind of body of work going we wont know but hes been everything we thought he is
6183616 the federal communications commission found a way to squeeze us in instead of squeezing us out
6183617 the bad news is we have to move the good news is were still on the air which means we will be able to continue serving the community
6183618 from the moment we found out that kdrts frequency was being threatened by encroachment a coalition of kdrt programmers other community volunteers and dmas staff and board began organizing a concerted campaign to try to fight this
6183619 the save our station or sos campaign focused on public education cultivating support from elected officials and public policy makers and raising money to pay for the legal and engineering fees associated with the fight we knew it was a long shot and we also knew we had to try
6183620 the unfortunate turmoil that kdrt lp was subjected to when its frequency was undermined by a full power station had a silver lining
6183621 while some smaller low power stations were quickly intimidated by corporate lawyers who told them their channel was no longer theirs kdrts strong organization helped bring public attention to the plight of low power groups having their stations taken
6183622 the impact of kdrts story was felt in washington dc and the fcc has at least provisionally changed course on supporting the rights of community media as the result of kdrt lp and stations in similar predicaments standing up for their rights
6183623 for the fcc to look at kdrt and say this is what we charged them to do and they have been successful and then pull the plug just didnt make sense
6183624 it would have been a serious breach of public interest as well
6183625 this is great proof that the davis community cares deeply about freedom as long as peoples voices can be heard on their airwaves we have a powerful tool for questioning the work of our government while also listening to great music
6183626 this community dug into its pockets and hearts to come up against the fcc and our small voice was heard all the way to the office of the chairman
6183627 at the end of the day i cant say im exactly glad this happened
6183628 i wouldnt want anyone to go through this i said publicly in april 2007 that kdrt would not go off the air on my watch i meant it as a call to action and i can say that we are all gratified by the response and support

6183639 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6183640 it kind of bugs me im always getting rocked i need to get my video game skills up thats for sure
6183641 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6183642 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6183643 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6183644 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6183645 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6183646 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6183647 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6183648 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6183649 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6183650 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6183651 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us

6183664 theyre snarling their teeth because we also gained touchstone recently as a new blogger who used to be a christian who discussed various issues with them whom they now disown
6183665 i have repeatedly talked about the problem of pain for sentient animals due to the law of predation in the world as animals prey on each other for food including animal consumption by the top of the food chain human beings
6183666 due to predation in the natural world there has been a horrendous amount of animal pain for hundreds of thousands of years before the ascent of human beings
6183667 there has been a great deal of slaughter due to our supposed need to eat animals down to today
6183668 in some parts of the world like china they eat dogs
6183669 in the bible we see where god supposedly even required humans to sacrifice animals on altars to him
6183670 the amount of pain among the animal world calls for an explanation for the reasons why a good god supposedly created them i argued that there was no need for animals at all and that there was no need for the law of predation in the natural world god couldve made every single creature a vegetarian or vegan and made vegetation as plenteous as weeds are today
6183671 i have asked what animals did to deserve the pain they experience
6183672 would there also be a hell for animals that do wrong
6183673 what about rabid dogs or those trained by their masters to kill other dogs in those hideous dog fights we hear about will these dogs go to heaven too or do only the sweetie petite lap dogs get to go to heaven
6183674 will the dogs of unbelievers get to go to heaven or will they go to hell with their unbelieving masters
6183675 or would there be separate heavens for each distinct species a dog heaven a cat heaven and so forth since many species just dont get along with each other
6183676 would a tamed cat still be a cat if it didnt hunt mice
6183677 these are ridiculous questions if you ask me but they are entailed by such a bizarre belief
6183678 the bottom line according to philosopher c e m joad is that either animals have souls or they have no souls if they have none pain is felt for which there can be no moral responsibility and for which no misuse of gods gift of moral freedom can be invoked as an excuse
6183679 if they have souls we can give no plausible account a of their immortality i e how to draw the line between animals with souls and men with souls
6183680 what i hear from them instead is that we cannot understand gods ways that we are ignorant and all we can do is guess about this and guess about that this is simply not enough whether it comes to the beginningless existence of the trinity divine prophetic foreknowledge the incarnation the virgin birth the atonement the general resurrection of our bodies free will in heaven the problem of evil or a great many other beliefs including animals in heaven christians retreat to this position far too many times for me to have enough reasons to believe period
6183681 i also criticized the probability of having resurrected bodies too how is it possible to resurrect any body whether man or beast if that body no longer exists due to being completely eaten or burned to dust
6183682 but if jason is going to claim that animals go to heaven he needs to create some kind of distinction between living things that are part of an ecosystem such as plants and animals and fido however as john has clearly noted he has made no such distinction for example we eat animals for food and we need plants to generate oxygen from carbon dioxide some of these animals need to eat plats and even other animals will this new earth have the same ecosystem
6183683 what about the vast number of animals weve spent hundreds of years breeding as pets
6183684 but again jason fails to indicate on what basis would such a distinction be made
6183685 in addition jason has utterly failed to address is the gradation of sentiency we observe in all living things
6183686 this is the kind of narrow human centric view of reality id expect from theists animals do not make it to heaven not because they are living sentient creatures but by being valued possessions of gods favorite species
6183687 like the strawberry wives that laid two or three great strawberries at the mouth of their pot and all the rest were little ones
6183688 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6183689 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6183690 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6183691 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6183692 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6183693 harris amp harris is finally cheap enough to buy for a long long long term buy buy some hide the shares in a shoebox come back in 20 years

6183699 what about the millions of pounds of pesticide that havent been sprayed in the air to protect our crops because a safe and ubiquitous soil organism called bacillus thuringiensis engineered into the plants kills crop eating caterpillars
6183700 jacqueline who was if youve seen the godfather would be like the consigliore to aaron at that time said this is a sign of god weve got to go kill the sons and daughters of perdition which is what you were named if you left the church
6183701 they ascribed to a thing called blood atonement which basically meant for you to go to heaven you had to be killed
6183702 part of the instruction was to kill anybody over 6 years old who saw what happened
6183703 this is about the best planned murders ive ever seen in 30 years of prosecution
6183704 can speak spanish like a mexican and not like an american so its very easy to blend in and just disappear pretty much anywhere in central america
6183705 if you would ever meet any of these folks to talk to them you wouldnt even suspect that they were engaged in the conduct that they engage in
6183706 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
6183707 theyd say sweetheart appreciate it for all its worth because it all changes when you get into your 30s i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6183708 tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it
6183709 i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
6183710 its my dream age i dont know why but literally since my 12th birthday ive wanted to turn 30 i feel like theres nothing more graceful or elegant than the beauty of a female when she has figured out who she is and thats what happens for women in their 30s
6183711 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6183712 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6183713 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6183714 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6183715 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6183716 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6183717 the delegations finished the draft which now goes to the political leaders for discussions
6183718 things without all remedy should be without regard whats done is done
6183719 our revels now are ended these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloud capped towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep prospero act iv scene i
6183720 the actions of the current prime minister show signs of high treason and political corruption
6183721 we are handing over materials in our possession to the security forces for a detailed examination
6183722 concerning the tensions between ukraine and the black sea fleet i think that the ukrainian authorities should behave in a more responsible way and not lead ukraine into military conflicts
6183723 this is a message of intolerance and a perfidious scene of ethnic cleansing that was preconceived as a way to drive away people of other ethnicities and religions living in sarajevo
6183724 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6183725 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6183726 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6183727 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6183728 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6183729 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6183730 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results
6183731 and every day that goes by beyond the deadline of noon yesterday monday is a day when the world can see that russia is not living up to its word and that is something very serious not just for georgia it is very serious for russian reputation around the world
6183732 but the political consequences of this are over the more medium term and russia is finding itself isolated even from some of its traditional allies
6183733 i would like and appreciate that georgia joins nato but as far as i understood they didnt tell anything that georgia will join nato
6183734 i love russian people i like their living style i like this people but you know their new president dmitry medvedev and his policies i dont like he is a very angry man
6183735 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6183736 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6183737 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6183738 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders
6183739 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6183740 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6183741 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6183742 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6183743 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6183744 as for the number of dead we challenge any agency to come and prove the accuracy of the figures published in the western media
6183745 they say 300 000 were killed we ask where are the graves darfur is now open
6183746 so sold out that microsoft japan actually put out an official statement about the situation in the land of the rising sun apologizing for the lack of consoles since demand has eclipsed supply microsofts supply has gone totally dry the company is ramping up production and the console will not be shipped to stores until next month
6183747 it doesnt take very long to look and see the difference in this department now than this department eight years ago
6183748 weve had our professional disagreements but theyve never become personal weve always been able to work those out

6183752 during the last half of the fiscal year danier adjusted its promotions increased markdowns and offered attractive price points to customers
6183753 although the average sale and gross margin decreased the promotions generated a significant increase in sales and customer traffic and helped reduce inventory that had been built up during the first half of the fiscal year

6183761 paraguay is one of just 23 countries which recognize taiwan rather than china and there are reports that lugo could switch diplomatic allegiance
6183762 a brief civil war brought the colorado party to power in 1949 five years later a military coup saw general alfredo stroessner installed as president a vainglorious man he employed torture murder and bogus elections to remain in power for the next 35 years
6183763 was overthrown in 1989 75 of paraguayans had known no other leader stroessner was replaced by general andr s rodr guez formerly stroessners right hand man he canceled the countrys perennial state of emergency eliminated censorship legalized opposition parties and released political prisoners the 1993 presidential election of juan carlos wasmosy a free market zealot and former member of stroessners faction inspired a number of nationwide strikes he came under scrutiny for shady business dealings in may 1998 the colorado party reconfirmed its staying power with the election of president raul cubas however he was accused of abusing his powers by freeing conspirator general lino oviedo from prison despite orders to keep him there when vice president luis arga a was gunned down by assassins in 1999 popular sentiment linked cubas and oviedo to the murder and cubas was forced to resign luis gonz lez macchi was sworn in while cubas and oviedo fled to neighboring countries
6183764 in 2000 a judge ordered the extradition from brazil of alfredo stroessner
6183765 in 2002 president macchi was charged with embezzlement but survived impeachment on leaving government he was put on trial on charges of corruption nicanor duarte frutos another colorado party member came to power in april 2003 claiming hed break the stronghold of the elite government efforts to implement free market reforms were highly unpopular leading to peasant led land invasions in 2004 the same year the wheels of justice turned against oviedo when he was imprisoned upon his return from exile

6183769 great lesson of latin america of the last 70 or 80 years
6183770 of repeating the bloody cycle s that have so definitively marked our continent
6183771 was generally limp grudging and dismissive of a ceremony of hemispheric significance
6183772 were certainly sad to see president nicanor duarte frutos the last colorado party boss being edged out by a man in sandals and an open necked shirt lugo was demonstrating in his dress what he said in his first presidential address that he was going to take some notice at last of the poorest in society and that his special attention would be given to the guaran s themselves paraguays long ignored indigenous people indeed as the paraguayan establishment spluttered to each other lugo had the effrontery to begin his inaugural address in the guaran language
6183773 what no one in the western media was keen to highlight was the fact that with lugo the powerful liberation theology that the late pope john paul ii and ronald reagan had joined in trying to throttle
6183774 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here

6183776 the combination of the network with sams offers considerable design flexibility with the network providing an exact definition of structures in the substrate plane and the sam permitting separate surface modification
6183777 the hybrid system can provide control on a length scale and at a precision not readily achievable otherwise
6183778 weve seen a doubling in the number of products in the past 14 to 16 months and i dont think that upward trend will change much in the future
6183779 we are shifting from first generation to second generation and potentially third generation nanotechnology so these products or substances that might be in the workplace or market will become significantly more complex in terms of their structure and properties
6183780 we have a group under nni now the national nanotechnology coordination office that looks at the regulatory agencies but its oriented entirely toward research what we need is a coordinating group that is oriented toward regulation
6183781 we need to consistently recognize the unique character of nanomaterials and that the biological effects and potential hazards are not the same in most cases as the bulk material
6183782 ffdca has at least two glaring gaps in coverage both of which are very relevant to nanotechnology
6183783 epa has received and reviewed numerous new chemical notices under tsca for nanoscale materials
6183784 both the agencies and congress need some place they can turn to for an analysis of what technologies and what scientific breakthroughs are coming down the pike
6183785 the pace of innovation is going to get faster and faster
6183786 the government is going to become more and more irrelevant
6183787 nanotechnology is a huge part of americas future but itll never take off if people dont trust that its safe
6183788 as we begin to further understand the immense capacity of this technology to improve our quality of life public health and environmental safety must be top priorities
6183789 our recommendation was to break out the ehs component from the ethical and societal concerns component and have a coordinator for each one
6183790 as one of the key missing elements required to develop a comprehensive research program for addressing potential risks of nanomaterials
6183791 if the government is going to be funding the development of nanotechnology it ought to make sure that it is done safely
6183792 we like the emphasis in the bills on developing the technology to measure nanomaterials and characterize them but we think you need to actually apply these new measurement technologies to help you understand what nanotechnologies are doing in the environment in someones body and inside cells
6183793 it is not an oversight bill at all the nni itself is not regulatory in any way shape or form
6183794 if you are going to have adequate markets you have to have adequate oversight
6183795 we cant just rely on markets to protect the public or to protect the environment i think oversight is important for the future of nanotechnology as well as for the public
6183796 in effect we broadcast a radio signal to the nanotube and listened for its vibrations
6183797 special dispensation from pope benedict xvi to leave the church to become president with the option of returning to the clergy

6183816 you can do the same reaction on a microfluidic chip instead of in a big tank and concentrate it in one area

6183818 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6183819 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6183820 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6183821 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6183822 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6183823 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6183824 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6183825 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6183826 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6183827 today could be the day and you need to be ready

6183841 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly
6183842 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul
6183843 well err on the side of safety well defend the official who may be a little more strict because thats a major point of emphasis
6183844 this is a short dvd that focuses on proper injury prevention tackling techniques

6183848 they were doing a lot of talking saying they were going to beat us and do this and that to us
6183849 theres a difference when they say something and we do if we come out and say were going to beat the hell out of australia then we are arrogant and cocky when they say it its that theyre not scared and theyre not backing down from the u s
6183850 we couldve easily went back at them and talked trash back to them today but we let the score talk
6183851 you just know the run can come at any second with them
6183852 we want to play the defending champs argentina is the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6183853 this is a very competitive race and its going to be a great travers
6183854 i dont think most people know we have a track team
6183855 when you go to essex essex prepares you for this
6183856 i didnt know they didnt have their own track until i got there
6183857 i was shocked when it got cold we were running around on that basketball court and everything i couldnt believe it
6183858 it strengthens you a lot mentally just being there in newark challenges everything once you go there and you leave all athletes that pass through essex can deal with anything and once you work with coach smart you will make it hes such a tough man
6183859 were getting whoever we can most of them dont have any other place to go its essex or nowhere
6183860 we dont give full scholarships either they still have to spend some of their own money on books or clothes or things like that for almost all of them its the first time theyve seen snow and icy weather theyre adjusting their whole life
6183861 recruiting is all negotiation talking to them and trying to convince them to come but until they get off that plane theres no telling you wait and say ok lets see who actually shows up basically you just hope for the best
6183862 her potential is probably better than any athlete ive ever had including kerron and melaine
6183863 basically she got hurt and spoiled and pampered and fat and i guess people didnt want her now shes being recruited by every track program in the country
6183864 we are about sticking by athletes through thick and thin through injury and poor performances
6183865 that is why sports are such an exciting field there are no guarantees there is heartbreak and failure as well as excitement and triumph
6183866 i think the folks at nike do want to come out of the games with a big win they have the luxury of multiple opportunities for that
6183867 not that they arent winning medals all over the place
6183868 but those big iconic victories that transcend the games that just hasnt happened yet
6183869 its really been fun to watch and to watch this u s basketball team perform
6183870 i wouldnt say we expected it such good performance but we hoped for it
6183871 the u s basketball team is becoming a global favorite again
6183872 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6183873 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6183874 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6183875 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6183876 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent

6183904 ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions
6183905 we just felt that at this point with ty wigginton playing a lot of outfield and kazuo matsui down if we had a chance to get this guy hed give us another experienced infielder and it gives cecil cooper a lot more flexibility
6183906 when you look at it hes 27 and he could do more than just serving a reserve role for us at the end of the season
6183907 hes got a chance to help us going forward as well so it made sense
6183908 my thought process was just wandy not to say q had problems with him just in the last two of the three we havent been real good
6183909 so well give brad a chance they always work well together wandy and ausmus the thought was to keep quintero and let him catch most of the time but well give brad a shot to catch wandy they always work well together and its good because its brads last time playing here
6183910 hes done a great job a real good job hes shown that hes got a chance to be a valuable part of our team next year
6183911 yesterday we put our lefties on them so today were going to whoop them with our righties
6183912 hes better against lefties than righties so well give our righties a chance to beat him up it worked ok yesterday we did all right with our lefties against ben sheets
6183913 i thank god because god has given me opportunities to keep doing this job that i know how to do ill keep pitching and try to pass some more
6183914 i was at zero on the list once and now im at fourth which means ive passed a lot of good dominican closers like mel rojas and alfonseca all those were good closers to put me fourth on the list is an honor
6183915 i liken him to some of that craig biggio type of character he played hard every day very very competitive he knew how to dial it up hed dial up the intensity when he needed to a phenomenal hitter and defensive player
6183916 i had a chance to be around him a little bit off the field
6183917 a good guy real good guy you hate to hear anybody go through the stuff that hes going through he liked to joke and have fun
6183918 its nothing major just trying to stay back on the rubber and quit rushing so much

6183927 im a twenty seven year old man and im only five feet one inch tall
6183928 but you can expect both more drought and more flood
6183929 think about the difference in climate if you get all of those 32 inches of rain in one month or if you get a little bit every day
6183930 its the difference in living in a desert or a lush grassland
6183931 the effect of climate change on the states water resources over the next 50 years is probably small enough that it is unnecessary to plan for it specifically
6183932 for a while i was urging our state agencies to at least address these climate change issues
6183933 it sure looks to me that this is an issue were going to have to respond to
6183934 this has huge implications for a state that has traditionally been dependent on over 200 reservoirs
6183935 the issues are no longer with what is causing it but what we should do about it and how we can adapt
6183936 the criticisms that weve received have not been from people who understood water supply planning or the adaptive nature of water supply planning
6183937 global warming likely to mean more droughts and more floods
6183938 mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6183939 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league

6183941 oil you can substitute with other things water you cannot substitute
6183942 there is going to be enough water for the urban growth but what we need to have is a balance so the agriculture community can continue to survive
6183943 when you have a drought everyone complains and everyone wants to do something but then when its good everyone forgets
6183944 as all the land with the water delivery and electricity infrastructure is taken by housing developments agriculture may need to move north of the valley
6183945 to be honest theres not a whole lot we can do about it
6183946 id like to think we farmers are always going to have the water were going to need but you cant afford to have a population that is growing without water
6183947 the resacas small lakes in the lower rio grande were basically drying up and as it dried the fish collected in the ponds remaining and people desperate for food were out there
6183948 they come from the south and demand water workers follow them and then cities need more water

6183970 what we show in this paper is kind of a big shock we show that brown fat is derived from a muscle like cell and that brown fat and white fat are completely different
6183971 what it means is that muscle cells are precursor cells to brown fat cells
6183972 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6183973 so completely did he reflect the sacrificial simplicity of jesus that he became known as the christ of the coal mines
6183974 but those in the church who had authority over him did not feel this extravagance was appropriate and he was eventually dismissed it was a failure that hounded him for the rest of his life
6183975 what many art critics have commented on is not the swimming colors but the ominous lack of a doorway leading into the church vincent painted a church that no one could get into having tried all his life to work hard enough to get in it appears that he could not imagine in this last image of the church a door that might allow him with his enormous load of pain to enter in together with the scarcity of references to jesus in his last letters the absence of the door in the painting reveals his most fundamental fear that there is no way into the church and even more agonizing that there is no one waiting on the other side of the missing door
6183976 encourage one another daily as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by sins deceitfulness
6183977 ive got to say it was a very positive meeting
6183978 as long as their is an understanding that both sides respect each other then we will be halfway there
6183979 the referees have an important role to play and although people say the best referees are the ones that arent seen i think those days are gone because of the media coverage
6183980 from that point of view all we ask is that the referees get the big decisions right
6183981 we have a good crew who they are an honest bunch but they make mistakes
6183982 however there has to be an understanding that they will make mistakes and that the mistakes have got to be accepted
6183983 they asked if referees are accountable and we explained how they are accountable
6183984 there is an observer system and we analyse their marks at the end of the season and that decides where they will be placed the following season
6183985 but we are not going to hang any referee out to dry thats not what we are designed for
6183986 lets not forget weve had the first two weeks of the season and we have looked at some magnificent games of football
6183987 the dundee united versus celtic game was a super game as was hamilton against dundee united and hearts versus motherwell
6183988 but we have centred on two decisions and we have to centre on the positives rather than the negatives
6183989 i felt it was a big plus and it helped to clear the air
6183990 it got a bit heated at times but i think thats a good thing
6183991 the whole idea is to build up a better understanding of the difficulties we face
6183992 i think the idea is great and there should be one at the beginning of the season and one in the middle in case other hiccups or problems arise
6183993 i didnt quite understand where he was coming from but thats all right i appreciated the call

6184009 excel in being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
6184010 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6184011 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6184012 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6184013 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6184014 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site
6184015 eventually we seek to engineer systems where a drug could be delivered to a specific tissue or set of cells anywhere in the body we want to make that possible
6184016 the presence of the nanoparticle can hinder the function of lung surfactant by affecting the interaction between the lipids and peptides
6184017 there is mounting evidence that very small particles have a greater negative impact on health than larger particles
6184018 nanoparticles emitted by diesel engines and other combustion sources are a health concern because of both their size and the carcinogens with which they are associated this problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is currently no effective regulatory control of these nanoparticles
6184019 it could help us reach the goal of engineering biofuel molecules to reduce emissions

6184031 proteins induced by telomere dysfunction and dna damage represent biomarkers of human aging and disease
6184032 many older people have a very good ability to regenerate even better than some younger people
6184033 one interesting observation was that the same proteins can be measured in human blood and that a significant increase can be shown to be associated with aging and age related diseases
6184034 they could also be used to test behavioural intervention food supplements and pharmacological therapies to delay the aging processes
6184035 normally no one ever turns up to work here wearing a tie
6184036 im happy to say that were only two months behind schedule at the moment
6184037 thats nothing at all in a project of this size
6184038 the energy that is concentrated in a tiny volume is equivalent to that of two elephant herds each with 120 members running toward each other at top speed in the savanna obviously this is an encounter that will raise a lot of dust
6184039 we are looking as it were for dinosaur particles from the prehistory of the universe
6184040 its a foregone conclusion that we should be working on this international project

6184044 they need to be much more resistant to radiation on the lhc we have configured the design so that although the silicon discs age with adjustments they will remain functional for around 10 years
6184045 it is very important that the electronic system generate as little heat as possible as bubbles would be created in the liquid argon at such low temperatures
6184046 i came here for the first time in 1978 as a student and was immediately fascinated
6184047 clearly the symmetry between matter and antimatter is not perfect
6184048 although we know what kind of symmetry breaking we need up to now we havent found the origin of this asymmetry which safeguards the existence of our world
6184049 we played a big part in the development of the silicon detectors
6184050 however our main job was to develop the read out chips if they dont work then lhcb is dead
6184051 if we had built the read out electronics with commercially available components they would have failed after a few hours of operation these here are intended to last 10 years
6184052 thats not so easy and we need to be very careful
6184053 so the elephants must not be allowed to break out

6184075 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6184076 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6184077 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6184078 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6184079 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6184080 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6184081 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect

6184084 as god is my judge i do not owe my ex wife any money
6184085 you have to have confidence in your own ability to be able to go it alone to go against what the rest of the culture is doing
6184086 often we have to face some type of crisis during our recovery such as the death of a loved one
6184087 habits are like comfortable beds they are easy to get into but difficult to get out of
6184088 good habits are as addictive as bad habits and a lot more rewarding
6184089 you leave old habits behind by starting out with the thought i release the need for this in my life
6184090 if we are to achieve a rich culture rich in contrasting values we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric one in which each diverse human gift will find a fitting place
6184091 quit running you will never find a way out like that
6184092 if you could just stop in one of the little coal mining towns mr churchill

6184094 and you will say with equal right and equal pride i cut the coal
6184095 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6184096 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6184102 i had a few bone fragments floating around in my elbow joint causing inflammation there were also bone spurs that needed to be removed it has been ongoing for a while
6184103 it reduced my flexibility in the right arm and if it was extended too much it would swell up and be useless for a few days until the inflammation went down so it was a priority to get it fixed as soon as this last fight was over which is what we did dr sanders and young operated on it in las vegas on july 10 and removed the bone fragments and bone spurs
6184104 mostly because i am training on it so much but should be completely healed within the next few weeks i have been doing cardio and some grappling but havent been able to spar for some time i am trying to be ready by november but its a safer bet to say i will be fighting in december

6184108 every tyranny must necessarily be grounded upon general popular acceptance in short the bulk of the people themselves for whatever reason acquiesce in their own subjection the central problem of political theory why in the world do people consent to their own enslavement the mystery of civil obedience why do people in all times and places obey the commands of government which always constitutes a small minority of the society
6184109 senator mccain i truly hope you get the opportunity to chase bin laden right to the gates of hell and push him in as you stated on your forum i do have a question though disabled veterans especially in this state have horrible conditions i think it is a sad state of affairs when we have illegal aliens having a medicaid card that can access specialist top physicians the best of medical and our vets cant even get to a doctor these are the people that we tied yellow ribbons for and bush patted on the back if we dont reenact the draft i dont think we will have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell

6184161 they pretty much always listened to jason faulkners bedtime with the beatles which they listen to when they go to sleep
6184162 but im sure that was imposed on them by their beatles loving daddy
6184163 early on they really liked early ray price they emmett in particular also liked to listen to me play the ukulele
6184164 emmetts favorite song on that for a while was the hokey pokey
6184165 i would also play them frosty the snowman emmetts fave and bingo sophias fave though emmett likes it when i play it guitar
6184166 they would make deals with each other that if one got to hear their favorite then the other could hear his or hers
6184167 so much so that for a long time every time frosty came on emmett would say that was the deal
6184168 but they seem to have somewhat similar tastes theyre also not that explicit about what they do and dont like
6184169 every once in a while well be playing something and one will say i like this song but for the most part their tastes are similar

6184177 the wire has never received an emmy nomination for drama series a crime almost as heinous as the ones that were perpetrated each week on this gritty baltimore cop show
6184178 the wire the complete fifth season 60 a dvd that preserves all 10 episodes in the finale of this hbo classic
6184179 the wire didnt deliver if you have never entered the world inhabited by bunk bubbles and omar stop reading this right now and rent the dvds of the first four seasons
6184180 the wire the last word focuses specifically on the industry giving several real editors and reporters including klein jacob weisberg of slate and steve luxenberg of the washington post the chance to offer their opinions on the state of the media today its not a pretty picture
6184181 the wire odyssey is semi entertaining and the six commentary tracks are informative especially to marylanders who get a kick out of all the shout outs to the baltimore personalities and places that pop up
6184182 the wire is used to wanting more as satisfying as this last season was we still want more mcnulty more daniels and more multifaceted stories from that rough very real city and of course more emmy nominations

6184233 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse

6184292 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6184293 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6184294 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6184295 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years

6184342 we have a lot of depth this year we have a lot of great players and we have a lot of good people
6184343 individually theyre all in it for the team and that team first attitude is what were looking for this year
6184344 she finished last season having the best blocking match of the year and we expect her to just continue on from that point whenever she can have a great match blocking its tremendous for our success
6184345 genny hits the ball harder than anyone and shes worked on more of a line shot in the spring which is going to give her a lot more opportunities to score she also worked on her passing in the spring and thats going to make her a mainstay for us
6184346 bridget is the type of player that can do everything
6184347 shes got the big block and a strong left hand coming from the right side that aids us as well
6184348 i would say that maria had the best individual spring than any other player
6184349 she had to make quite an adjustment from coming over from sweden last august but i think this spring really gave her an idea as to how we train i think that really helped her a lot as to her passing shes already been an exceptional defensive player but now shes just a solid outside hitter for us
6184350 this is a player thats coming off an outstanding spring
6184351 shes always been a really good defender and really quick on the court shes worked on her passing during the off season and her realization that she can take more area is going to continue to improve her confidence and help us that much more this is going to be a year that she gets noticed around the conference
6184352 i think our backcourt is so much stronger this year and we have such a great collection of good passers to go to this season
6184353 and thats a very important aspect of the game of volleyball starting off your offense
6184354 katies coming back for her sophomore year and were going to ask her to do even more this season as far as running an even more efficient offense
6184355 shes going to have some new challenges with experience you gain more knowledge and trying to put her hitters in a better position to score she also possesses a great serve and we expect a really big year out of her
6184356 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6184357 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6184358 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6184359 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6184360 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6184361 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6184362 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket

6184370 based on information and belief it appears that during petitioners capital murder trial judge holland and mr oconnell were engaged in a secret long term intimate relationship
6184371 petitioner has only recently received highly credible evidence supporting this allegation
6184372 this was the only available way as we perceive it to get a deposition before the execution date ellis says of the petition
6184373 they are in the only position to verify the allegations or deny them
6184374 their strategy of silence is understandable proof of an undisclosed intimate relationship could not only result in civil liability it could also taint the validity of numerous judgments convictions and sentences in collin county texas including petitioners capital murder conviction for which he is scheduled to be put to death on september 10 2008
6184375 this court has neither jurisdiction nor inherent authority to order the stay of a capital execution
6184376 if a boat tied up to captains cove had a fire on board whos going to go out there to rescue the people on board and put the fire out

6184378 when this water canon is running at full capacity the boat would actually spin backwards out of control unless you counteract the force of the water with the engines its not as easy as it looks
6184379 as an example there was a fire at the washburn amp doughty shipyard boatyard in boothbay up in maine
6184380 they lost everything millions of dollars in damage the worst fire there in 200 years that could have been prevented if they had a fireboat

6184510 magnetic insoles help alleviate the pain caused by standing on the feet every day which makes them great for wait staff cooks medical staff postal carriers and other physically demanding jobs
6184511 people feel pain when the pain impulses in our nerves travel though our body and register in the brain stopping these pain impulses from reaching the brain is how we can easily prevent and treat pain our magnetic insoles featuring the correct placement and magnet strength are specifically designed to stop pain impulses from ever reaching the brain
6184512 as a hair stylist i am on my feet for eight to ten hours a day foot pain has seriously hampered my career and i had to cut back on the number of shifts i could work
6184513 now with my magnetic insoles i am thrilled that i can go back to a full working schedule the magnetic insoles are easy to wear and the best part is that they work with any of my shoes

6184518 lifeclinic is committed to helping our retailer customers design and implement programs that can help control their organizations healthcare costs for example when our health stations identify an employee who is pre hypertensive there is an opportunity for early intervention and education to promote generally recommended lifestyle changes which in turn may allow the employee to forgo the need for costly medications visits to the doctor and missed days of work obviously this also benefits the employers bottom line for those people who our health stations identify as being hypertensive the employees healthcare provider can be called upon to immediately address factors such as lack of exercise unhealthy diet obesity and bad lifestyle habits and may also recommend inexpensive medication that will prevent the much higher costs of hospitalization and lost productivity

6184526 openclinica removes many of the constraints that proprietary vendors tend to put on their clients
6184527 openclinica gives the research sponsor much greater latitude in how they implement and support their systems this is becoming increasingly important as research grows in expense and complexity
6184528 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
6184529 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings

6184532 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6184533 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6184534 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6184535 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6184536 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6184537 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6184538 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6184539 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6184540 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6184541 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6184542 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6184543 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6184544 settle has everything i admire in a great band poetry tunefulness originality and vision all pursued recklessly as if the whole thing might fall apart at any second and you can dance to it
6184545 it the withdrawal is not significant and it needs to increase

6184547 talks in the past three days took place in a constructive and positive atmosphere talks were about safeguards related issues and the cooperation between iran and the iaea
6184548 were obviously very concerned about much of what russia has been doing lately
6184549 when we see a russian bear approaching canadian air space we meet them with an f 18
6184550 we remind them that this is canadian air space that this is canadian sovereign air space and they turn back and we are going to continue to do that to demonstrate that we are watching closely their activities here
6184551 will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the u s and its followers continue posing military threats to it
6184552 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6184553 hamas is capable of imposing law and order in the gaza strip and we dont need external forces here
6184554 we are talking about a very big project that will give the iaf another refueling system
6184555 we took the airplane used by former prime minister benjamin netanyahu and turned it into an aerial refueling plane the fact that the iaf will have another of these aircraft means that more planes will be able to achieve their mission we expect this aircraft to have the ability to refuel other planes in a short amount of time
6184556 massive capabilities and tools during the second lebanon war that it refrained from using because it was fighting a terror organization not a state
6184557 there will no longer be a situation of distant fighting where major cities continue with life as usual the war will reach the cities and homes of israeli citizens and our enemys objective will be to target the homefront
6184558 we will be forced to bring an end to hostilities quickly at the smallest possible cost using our comparative advantage
6184559 there is no need to frighten ourselves more than is necessary regarding the threats
6184560 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important i think we should speed it up
6184561 the strait of hormuz is one of 14 locations in the world with unique strategic importance over 60 percent of the worlds energy reserves are located in the persian gulf and 17 million barrels of oil are transported daily from the strait by oil tankers closing the strait of hormuz is part of irans defense policy in the face of the u s military threat
6184562 but they are scarred and wounded how can they be well
6184563 earthmaker leaves the scars for they preserve the memory of pain he will leave my hands this way so men will not forget what it can cost to be a singer in a theater of hate
6184564 but the word the word they wrote upon your face is gone
6184565 because earthmaker cannot bear a lie he could not let me wear the word for he is truth he knows no contradiction in himself so learn this my little friend no man may burn a label into flesh and make it stay when heaven disagrees
6184566 weve taken the decision to start dynamic integrity testing of the line today before a move to full operation

6184605 i suspect that mccain really wants ridge on his team and may even believe that the centrist strength of a mccain ridge ticket would more than offset any losses on the right
6184606 the mccain campaign has been calling key state gop officials around the country and sounding them out about the consequences of a pro choice vp pick
6184607 may be more willing to take the plunge than the naysayers have anticipated
6184608 the presumptive gop nominee is no longer considering former pennsylvania governor tom ridge
6184609 mccain and his people may be engaged in a bit of elaborate gamesmanship designed to make evangelicals more grateful than they otherwise might be for the selection

6184672 remind me where the next 7 11 is okay or well end up in la and youll be in so much trouble
6184673 like i cant figure it out because prison messes with your sexual gauges for a while but its not like i dont like getting with cute guys sex is weird complicated
6184674 everyone thinks its a crime to talk sex with me
6184675 like everyone is always like anya stop with the giles sexcapade talk dawn might hear and xanders new girlfriend is already on board with operation dawn needs to die a virgin and its so wrong like get off on el sueno
6184676 dawn babe its not that they think you should die a virgin

6184683 i totally got over that after i kissed that one vamp guy and besides angels a dork and spikes got wicked issues
6184684 dont worry dawn youre going to get to college and have so many dates that youll wish that you were back in the dale whining about your lack of dateage

6184694 ill feel better once we stop talking about how wes is an asshole and get back to the sex

6184696 i also look feel sound and taste good or so ive been told
6184697 good to know you dont suffer from low self esteem
6184698 sometimes a closed door is the very thing that gets us where god wants us to go ive come to think of closed doors as divine detours and while our failed plans can be incredibly discouraging and disorientating god often uses the things that seem to be taking us off our course to keep us on his course
6184699 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

6184708 im a writer and im working on a novel that if you play your cards right will include a character loosely based on you
6184709 to be fair its a small minority that really dont like the art style
6184710 a majority of the feedback weve gotten has been overwhelmingly positive about the art style i think when they see the final game theyll find its probably a bit darker than they might think what weve shown is the earliest parts of the game meant to be a little sunnier and brighter than the later because were trying to set a juxtaposition and make everything feel worse as the game move on in terms of the actual art style we went through three full art revisions where we essentially hit the reset button on all the art and started over again and one of the main reasons was when we tried to go towards what our memory of diablo ii was we found that it created a drab boring game that didnt play very well
6184711 one of the things i try to remind people who talk about the art style and what diablo ii looked like is theyre being very selective in their memory theyre remembering small parts of act i and small parts of act iii and conveniently forgetting all the green fields of act i and all of act ii which is actually one of the most popular acts the general kind of almost garish look of the monsters really made them stand out and those things made the game play really well they were actually criticized at the time when diablo ii came out it was panned for being too bright and cheerful compared to the original diablo of course the original diablo drew like little red lines around the enemies so you could actually see them
6184712 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6184713 its argued that a galaxys mass is correlated with the size of the black holes that are located within it so a globular cluster should have what would be considered a lesser version of the massive black holes at the centers of galaxies
6184714 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively accreting material
6184715 if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some of the material would be ejected in the form of high winds

6185072 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6185073 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6185074 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6185075 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6185076 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6185077 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6185078 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6185079 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters

6185137 ma la corte suprema ha ribaltato la loro decisione con 5 voti contro due abbiamo constatato che la legge statale del wisconsin bandisce i rapporti sessuali con chiunque non sia consenziente e questo si applica sia che la persona sia viva o morta al momento le persone decedute ovviamente non possono dare il loro consenso cos un individuo ragionevolmente bene informato dovrebbe capire che la legge proibisce i rapporti sessuali con i cadaveri

6185187 we would fix the passenger fares in a day or two after the atf price revision
6185188 just last week we introduced lower advance purchase fares and various special offers for example on the delhi mumbai sector if as expected the atf price is revised downward in the coming months then we would expect to see some additional fare reductions
6185189 survey respondents report a wide variety of hit platforms in use with different orientations and attributes medical management organizations appear to implement and use a number of approaches to optimize workflows that are developed both in house and through vendor applications for example 64 percent of the respondents report using multiple systems in contrast to 17 percent who rely on one system not surprisingly just 20 percent indicated that their system is fully integrated and interoperable with other external it applications
6185190 the survey findings warrant follow up discussion by health care thought leaders regarding 1 the lack of standardized information technology platforms currently available that support the care management process and 2 the need to define better ways to popularize successful strategies on the positive side we are pleased to note that a period of remarkable innovation is emerging
6185191 although the practice of nursing and medicine has been transformed with the advent and adoption of electronics and computers the application of health it systems as a tool to support care management is still evolving as a result leveraging technology to improve medical management intervention strategies should remain a high priority in terms of both public health and reduced medical costs cmsa is pleased to have participated in this important study which focuses attention on these important public policy issues
6185192 satisfaction levels appear to be mixed in terms of how the survey participants rate their experiences with care management software applications and electronic health record ehr systems surprisingly only 22 percent of the survey respondents reported that their care management software applications allow them to spend more time with their patients

6185232 after five years of hard work and important collaboration with our stakeholders we are so pleased that this one of a kind south suburban development will be having its grand opening this thursday its been a while in the making but the actual quality of the development from its impressive amenity package to its cutting edge energy saving features have made it well worth the wait we know there is great enthusiasm and anticipation among families looking for quality affordable rental housing in riverdale because we have been flooded with calls and inquiries we look forward to officially opening our doors to the community this week
6185233 this initial investment was critical in securing additional funding for the development and has helped to bring affordable housing to residents and also helped to revitalize the village of riverdale
6185234 this is the largest low interest loan the treasurers office has ever obtained for a community development project which speaks volumes about our commitment to the revitalizing struggling neighbors

6185280 sebelumnya kami tak saling kenal semua terjadi begitu saja karena tanpa disengaja kami sering bertemu di studio milik pepep
6185281 dari hasil riset kami sukses lagu lagu peterpan sheila on 7 the rock bahkan kangen band terletak pada pilihan nada nada minor khas pop melayu lagu lagu jenis itu cenderung gampang dimainkan dan mudah dicerna
6185282 yang paling nyata juga adalah kangen band yang meskipun dinista tetap laris karena musik mereka mudah dicerna ya kami akan membuat lagu seperti itu
6185283 tapi kami sadar ada di musik industri bagaimana mau masuk industri kalau musik kami tidak bisa dijual
6185284 kalau kami bikin yang pop standar sudah ada ungu mau buat dengan syair yang indah indah sudah ada dewa dengan gaya cuek cuekan sudah ada slank kami benar benar kerja keras untuk mencari pop melayu ini
6185285 di sebuah label besar lagu demo kami dilempar padahal belum didengarkan
6185286 kami sadar cara itu memerlukan modal besar tapi bismillah saja konsep kami memang pop melayu
6185287 karena bujet kecil akhirnya kami kerja rodi dengan mengunjungi berbagai stasiun radio dari satu kota ke kota lainnya setelah nyanyi lalu wawancara begitu seterusnya selama beberapa bulan lalu istirahat selama beberapa hari

6185306 i just came here for the fun i dont really care too much but sometimes i care because its like the tribe is going out
6185307 a lot of these kids here they dont even think theyre indians theyre like everyone else
6185308 we have a lot of gangs a lot of drug abuse right now much of that is because children dont have a good self concept its important for them to be proud of who they are to respect themselves to understand that they are a unique people but also part of a whole
6185309 we have visions that there will still be the language a century from now we have that truth

6185322 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6185323 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6185324 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6185325 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6185326 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6185327 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6185328 get paul gadd back now and lets keep a careful eye on him allow the police to do their job
6185329 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6185330 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work

6185384 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6185385 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6185386 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
6185387 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
6185388 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy
6185389 ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be okay no matter what
6185390 besides me being really vigilant about it mammograms and self examinations it is the no 1 reason i am going to live
6185391 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met

6185394 robinho nunca dijo que no disfruta en el madrid pero el hecho es que tiene una oferta econ mica m s interesante es solamente eso
6185395 s tengo que decir que hasta el 31 de agosto todo es posible hasta que no se cierre el plazo de fichajes no damos el asunto por cerrado el presidente ram n calder n le prometi a robinho que si presentaba en el club una oferta de 40 millones de euros lo dejar a salir

6185415 my best friends started calling me derogatory terms and started saying things to put me down like i was nothing
6185416 i think it was jealousy but it got to a point where i was too scared to go to school
6185417 a gigantic robot and the girl of your dreams are what you get at the cost of your life
6185418 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6185419 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6185420 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6185421 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6185422 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6185423 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6185424 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket
6185425 hi5 y es lo mismo bueno pero mas naco el hi5
6185426 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6185427 i think you have to figure out some way of keeping all of those capabilities and requirement in your life in balance
6185428 russell was incredibly gracious to me during a really hard time and in the aftermath
6185429 i empowered myself by not staying in the thing with russell i felt it was going to be repeating some similar patterns that id just gotten out of and it was a drag because i was crazy about him
6185430 he didnt talk and ill always be grateful to him for that but i did not leave my marriage for him i left because it was not working
6185431 i just dont feel like its seminal or major in any way i like my life right now i really like it whatever its taken to get here i appreciate
6185432 it seems that not even an emerging sector such as digital media is immune to the global economic downturn
6185433 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
6185434 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
6185435 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
6185436 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
6185437 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
6185438 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
6185439 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
6185440 he wanted to have some type of animal not a dog
6185441 i kind of had a problem with that because it didnt seem like i could hide a dog
6185442 this is a horrible accident a tragedy taking into the account the number of people we fear have died
6185443 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6185444 more children from the fit less from the unfit that is the chief aim of birth control

6185482 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6185483 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6185484 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6185485 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6185486 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6185487 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6185488 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6185489 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6185490 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6185491 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6185492 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6185493 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota

6185512 did you see what that man did filling in a word they think describes the person
6185513 they may be lazy but there might be something else going on
6185514 he so irresponsible he doesnt even care about me i bet he forgot all about me he went to hang out with his friends instead men never do like me
6185515 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference

6185519 regardless of which way you look at the situation we have to focus on ourselves
6185520 its focusing on within not from without when you start focusing outside you lose sight on what you need to think about working on and expend your energy the wrong way if you play the game hard everything else will take care of itself
6185521 we go out there and play the same way every day whether its the royals yankees as whatever
6185522 thats the way we go about our business thats one of the keys to our success for sure
6185523 its what were doing that matters were going to scoreboard watch and im o k with that i want us to take care of our effort and our mental preparation each night and im good with what happens

6185538 how about some discussion from the mccain campaign about a conservative who can be counted on across the board who can help lead the country in the right direction
6185539 who can help rebuild the republican party lieberman cant do that and rebuild the conservative movement mccain nor lieberman nor ridge can do that
6185540 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6185541 mccain has already seen to it that he can walk across the aisle that hes the top of the ticket
6185542 if anybody is going to attract moderates its going to be the top of the ticket guy hes not going to help himself any additional way hes going to hurt himself by putting a liberal or a liberal republican on this ticket particularly pro choice
6185543 i think mccain would like to pick him but he voted against samuel alito and is pro choice its hard to imagine the reaction at the convention and the conservatives to that circumstance
6185544 john mccain has some political capital with conservatives right now pro life conservatives but not that much and it would be very easy for him to squander with the wrong choice
6185545 at the end of the day youre only giving your private counsel to the president publicly you echo the presidents position and i think every vice president understands that and appreciates thats the rule
6185546 all i know is that my friend of 25 years john mccain is strongly and forever pro life he also believes that you shouldnt be judgmental on other peoples point of view with regard to this and some other very difficult issues and as i said before i think hell make the right choice for his vice presidential nominee
6185547 greatness is not found in possessions power position or prestige it is discovered in goodness humility service and character
6185548 i have to have that philosophy or ill get run over in this rat race of a world
6185549 do you enjoy being around other people with this attitude have you ever had or seen a good boss that possessed this attitude have you ever been around a person in authority with this philosophy that was effective
6185550 hows my me factor on a scale of 1 10
6185551 humble yourselves in the presence of the lord and he will exalt you
6185552 the only way to get what you want is to help other people get what they want
6185553 what makes humility so desirable is the marvelous thing it does to us it creates in us a capacity for the closest possible intimacy with god
6185554 i dont have to think negative i dont like this and thats okay but i choose not to let it ruin my life i choose to think positive i can stop rumination i choose to have peace of mind
6185555 for god causes all things to work together for good to those who love him and are called according to his purpose
6185556 our life is defined by who we plan to be in the face of adversity

6185573 we are still talking to the companies about the draft rfpand the current projection is that we would expect the final rfp to be out next week

6186059 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
6186060 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
6186061 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
6186062 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
6186063 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments

6186071 so sassy mo ive got an idea for our next column
6186072 it occurred to me as i was re reading the prince on the treadmill this afternoon that both john mccain and hillary clinton have a vested interest in seeing barack obama defeated this november so maybe for wednesday we should examine that interest i think something like that would be really useful for our millions of readers as theyre deciding which candidate to vote for in november
6186073 im hate to disagree but we do write for the new york times the paper of record and everything dont you think we have a responsibility to give readers some substance havent we gotten this far because of our expertise and i mean anyone can be witty
6186074 anyone can be witty are you kidding me no ones as clever as i am no one are you telling me theres someone else out there who could have come up with obambi i dont think so
6186075 and by the way miss serious reporter or whatever you think you are there are
6186076 oh you did not just say that when you dis voltaire you dis me
6186077 what so im manly or something whatever at least im educated

6186087 som udgangspunkt har jeg som konservativ ordf rer den m ls tning at folk skal beholde s meget af det de tjener som muligt og derfor har det konservative folkeparti ikke noget nske om at genindf re sp bidraget men det er selvf lgelig et instrument der kan tages i anvendelse hvis der er et st rkt behov for at gribe ind over for privatforbruget
6186088 det er klart at som konservativ ordf rer vil jeg ogs se p mulighederne for at begr nse den offentlige forbrugsv kst snarere end at begr nse privatforbruget

6186128 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6186129 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
6186130 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
6186131 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
6186132 the report shows the serious impact that the obesity crisis is having on our countrys health and economic well being
6186133 we need to continue to work to create a real push towards reversing the obesity epidemic it is time we make it a national priority

6186168 i will not permit profit from the lifeblood of a boston police officer by someone responsible for his killing
6186169 one of the most vivid pictures i have of my father as a police officer is a photograph showing him giving a young child cpr and saving his life
6186170 i remember being so proud of my father seeing him on the front page of the old record american saving a life years later as a 17 year old girl at my fathers wake a woman introduced herself to me as the childs mother
6186171 murdering a policeman in boston to bring peace to southeast asia was utterly senseless then and it is just as senseless now
6186172 twenty years ago i undertook a course of action that resulted in the death of another human being i cannot possibly say in words how sorry i am for the death of officer schroeder
6186173 when i got there i was surprised to see that my uncle jack was standing there looking out the window
6186174 my uncle just said that we had to go we had to go to the hospital he said my dad had been shot
6186175 as absolutely devastated as i was as the oldest my mother asked me to go tell my brothers and sisters
6186176 i remember walking from house to house where my brothers and sisters were staying with relatives i told each of my brothers and sisters and each time i cried again
6186177 he wasnt there to teach my brothers how to throw a football or how to change a flat tire
6186178 so did my brother paul my brother edward and recently my sister erin my sister joan married a police officer each of us in our own way have tried to follow in his tradition of service and devotion
6186179 the gravity of the crime was in imbalance to the sentence imposed and the sentence recommended was certainly inadequate

6186187 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
6186188 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly

6186200 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
6186201 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
6186202 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
6186203 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
6186204 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
6186205 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
6186206 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
6186207 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
6186208 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched

6186244 they know as well as i that jimmy has not even been indicted certainly not been convicted
6186245 and he has made the decision that he is going to continue in his capacity as a member of the board of county commissioners that is his call to make
6186246 the excuse being heard is that the cases are different while dann admitted wrongdoing dimora has not
6186247 the more telling similarity between dimora and dann is that the democrats seem more concerned with the political fallout in each situation than with what best serves the public
6186248 by waiting out the calendar jones and his fellow democrat insiders can ensure that their party gets to pick dimoras replacement rather than letting the people vote on a candidate this november
6186249 by refusing to tell commissioner dimora that its time to go board president peter lawson jones is putting the interests of the democratic party ahead of the interests of the citizens of cuyahoga county
6186250 the bottom line with the county commissioners and the beauty of the county commissioner system is that it takes two county commissioners to make anything happen jimmy cant do it by himself tim hagen cant do it by himself i cant do it by myself

6186319 after five years of hard work and important collaboration with our stakeholders we are so pleased that this one of a kind south suburban development will be having its grand opening this thursday its been a while in the making but the actual quality of the development from its impressive amenity package to its cutting edge energy saving features have made it well worth the wait we know there is great enthusiasm and anticipation among families looking for quality affordable rental housing in riverdale because we have been flooded with calls and inquiries we look forward to officially opening our doors to the community this week

6186325 survey respondents report a wide variety of hit platforms in use with different orientations and attributes medical management organizations appear to implement and use a number of approaches to optimize workflows that are developed both in house and through vendor applications for example 64 percent of the respondents report using multiple systems in contrast to 17 percent who rely on one system not surprisingly just 20 percent indicated that their system is fully integrated and interoperable with other external it applications
6186326 the survey findings warrant follow up discussion by health care thought leaders regarding 1 the lack of standardized information technology platforms currently available that support the care management process and 2 the need to define better ways to popularize successful strategies on the positive side we are pleased to note that a period of remarkable innovation is emerging
6186327 although the practice of nursing and medicine has been transformed with the advent and adoption of electronics and computers the application of health it systems as a tool to support care management is still evolving as a result leveraging technology to improve medical management intervention strategies should remain a high priority in terms of both public health and reduced medical costs cmsa is pleased to have participated in this important study which focuses attention on these important public policy issues
6186328 satisfaction levels appear to be mixed in terms of how the survey participants rate their experiences with care management software applications and electronic health record ehr systems surprisingly only 22 percent of the survey respondents reported that their care management software applications allow them to spend more time with their patients

6186363 its funnier to have me not work out to be as pale and flabby as i naturally am for the audiences enjoyment i think people have really responded to the movie because when you see nudity in hollywood films its usually really hot bodies even jason segal in forgetting sarah marshall hes got a nice bod he works out and hes got a big dick so theyre not used to seeing a pale flabby normal guy naked and its really sent america into a tizzy
6186364 im always in reaction to other actors and bouncing off other actors but fish drives this story so for the first couple of days it was me doing my first couple of takes like im used to doing and the director coming in and going no no youve got to move this along and drive this forward and really try to get what you want so i really had to shift gears

6186368 i think i was the first person to blog in character on the tv show i thought it would be something that would be fun to do and reveal a different side of dwight that was early on in the show and we were doing anything we could to help promote the show the internet was a very valuable tool it was really the success of the show on itunes and the fans spreading the word about it out on the web that took it from a tiny cult show to a popular mainstream hit
6186369 theres literally videos of me on youtube eating my lunch just the other day someone was filming me at baggage claim just waiting for our suitcases to come out what am i supposed to do if i go over and say could you not do that theyll probably film that and thatll end up on the web and ill be a dick so i just try to ignore it

6186528 shell believes the best solution to help with coastal preservation and assist the states and community that support oil and gas production is outer continental shelf federal revenue sharing
6186529 these projects will protect their oil and gas infrastructure and without that protection who knows what their long term liability will be

6186565 in any partnership both parties must assume responsibility for the satisfying each others needs
6186566 guarantees to the customer if the product or service he bought fails to meet his needs
6186567 thats why in reality most day to day activities of most marketers do not revolve around identifying and meeting needs they revolve around something entirely different trying to influence customers and potential customers to choose their particular offerings here marketing quickly flips over from identifying and meeting customer needs to changing customer attitudes and behaviours for the companys benefit not about meeting customer needs therefore but meeting the needs of the corporation

6186686 the wire odyssey is semi entertaining and the six commentary tracks are informative especially to marylanders who get a kick out of all the shout outs to the baltimore personalities and places that pop up
6186687 the wire is used to wanting more as satisfying as this last season was we still want more mcnulty more daniels and more multifaceted stories from that rough very real city and of course more emmy nominations

6186703 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

6186715 any dollar that wachovia can get off their balance sheet and preserve capital is a good thing and its good to see that there are buyers out there
6186716 the more important for question given the steep discount to the assets is how aggressive can they be in getting this stuff off the balance sheet without raising capital

6186727 i would also play them frosty the snowman emmetts fave and bingo sophias fave though emmett likes it when i play it guitar
6186728 they would make deals with each other that if one got to hear their favorite then the other could hear his or hers

6186784 people do not know what they want until a brilliant person shows them
6186785 people are stupid like the frog they work according to perceptions not facts they need to be told what to buy by brilliant people like me who know how to manipulate and change their perceptions so better marketing has got nothing to do with richer better information but it has got a lot to do with giving my company vast sums of money to spend on advertising

6186823 slovak telekom has for a long time distorted the competitive environment which has had negative consequences for consumers
6186824 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6186825 i kind of fell in love with it because i really enjoyed doing it track and i began to get good at it
6186826 i was doing great things on the track i kind of thought of it really like only a couple kids my age get a chance to turn pro in track it was kind of hard but at the end of the day i picked football
6186827 i knew i was going to have to race eventually when i got up here
6186828 it really wasnt something i was really looking forward to because i used to street race but then i kind of settled down because anything can happen out there running
6186829 i was ready to run again but i guess his groin started bothering him
6186830 then we were supposed to run again that friday we set it up and everything on the track but our coach wouldnt let us do it
6186831 hes a football player hes not a guy running track trying to play football
6186832 he didnt say anything to me but i said im sorry for going that hard
6186833 in 2004 20 million unmarried women did not vote and 15 million of that 20 were unregistered
6186834 in order to participate in democracy by voting you have to be registered
6186835 unmarried women are the largest group of unregistered people in this country and they are 9 percent less likely to register than married women
6186836 weve seen a huge increase in young people registering and participating in elections
6186837 we are going to be educating about what is at stake for young women and abortion rights is a major piece of that from who constitutes the supreme court to what congress is doing and what is on the ballot
6186838 so its a pretty dynamic reason for womens groups to vote and educate their peers about state ballot issues
6186839 we need to draw as many voters so that roe vs wade is not taken from us
6186840 we are planning to do some of the same things from 2006 with the get out her vote campaign
6186841 but in october we are bringing a panel of experts and have them speak out why its important to vote pro choice and how it should always be a choice no exceptions
6186842 be pro whatever it is you believe in and get out and vote
6186843 one of the things we think is cool about the voting vixen is that we were using consumer tactics that are used against us in terms of creating need and desire to purchase things so we tried to use that and harvest that power for good
6186844 after that well be reaching out to the outer boroughs queens and the bronx places that arent that well covered

6186858 right now they are not putting it out in any place we have teams in there monitoring the perimeter of the fire and they also fly over it once a day or more to keep track of it
6186859 it is burning very spotty it is not black from end of the wilderness to the other
6186860 it is a pretty rocky open area it is not a densely covered forest it is a lot of meadow open area
6186861 they are not going to let it burn out of the wilderness areas at all
6186862 its quite a ways to the east of us last year we got evacuated that wasnt any fun so they are keeping us informed
6186863 they told us it started by lightning so they considered it a managed burn and they told us if it went out of the wilderness area they would fight it
6186864 we dont control what they do but i hate to see stuff burn
6186865 when you have a natural event like this it is beneficial
6186866 these fish have evolved in these systems bull trout actually benefit from fires even high intensity fires as long as there is connectivity so the fish can move out of an area if it gets too hot before or after a fire

6186893 quando um pa s importa produtos de outros pa ses importante ter consci ncia do impacto gerado sobre os recursos de gua nas regi es em que estes produtos foram produzidos
6186894 por exemplo uma camisa produzida com algod o cultivado no paquist o ou no uzbequist o requer 2 7 mil litros de gua numa regi o que j apresenta sinais de escassez
6186895 no caso do brasil importante que o governo as empresas e os consumidores tenham maior consci ncia deste impacto preciso saber onde e em que condi es estes produtos s o produzidos
6186896 se um produto produzido em uma regi o amea ada h duas alternativas ou discutir formas de melhorar o gerenciamento local da gua ou mudar de fornecedor o que n o podemos fazer exportar nossos problemas para outros pa ses e consumir gua de regi es amea adas
6186897 o que nos preocupa particularmente que enormes quantidades destes produtos s o cultivadas em regi es mais secas do mundo onde os recursos da gua ou j est o amea ados ou muito provavelmente estar o sob amea a no futuro pr ximo

6186913 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6186914 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6186915 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6186916 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6186917 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6186918 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6186919 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6186920 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6186921 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6186922 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6186923 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6186924 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6186925 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6186926 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6186927 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6186928 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6186929 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6186930 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6186931 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6186932 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6186933 what we are seeing now is that the government is earmarking more resources to beef up it security
6186934 this it security essentially represents the systems viability i could have excellent processes but if my personal information appears on a website then its not going to benefit me
6186935 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6186936 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6186937 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6186938 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6186939 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6186940 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6186941 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6186942 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6186943 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6186944 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6186945 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6186946 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6186947 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6186948 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6186949 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

6186955 i have never seen a storm like this before not even just in my tenure but in all the years ive lived in rensselaer county ive never seen a storm like this hit it was an extraordinary event
6186956 the municipalities affected were affected to such a great degree in terms of the financial impact that we really need state and federal assistance so hopefully these teams will see that damage and write up their reports pass that information along such that we can get some assistance from the state or the federal government to begin repairing all of the damage that was done by last weeks storm
6186957 this is not a level of damage that we can expect local taxpayers alone to bear the brunt of
6186958 shes playing for russia right now so that makes her the enemy
6186959 i got an e mail from a father in saudi arabia searching for resources for his kids teacher
6186960 he had stumbled across hotchalk com and wanted to know if they could use it
6186961 its providing them with a lot of capital to build out their economies and build opportunities for their citizens domestically as well as foreign investors
6186962 a great deal of investment is going into major infrastructure projects
6186963 we expect the boom to continue for the next 10 to 20 years
6186964 when investing in emerging economies its best to invest in build out industries like telecom construction and banking

6186966 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion

6186971 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6186972 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6186973 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6186974 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6186975 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6186976 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6186977 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6186978 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6186979 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6186980 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6186981 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6186982 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6186983 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6186984 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6186985 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania

6186997 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6186998 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6186999 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6187000 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6187001 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6187002 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6187003 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6187004 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6187005 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6187006 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6187007 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6187008 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6187009 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6187010 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6187011 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6187012 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6187013 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6187014 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6187015 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6187036 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6187083 the trick lies in striking a fair balance encouraging new development and innovation without biasing the system toward one player
6187084 when the government steps in and says were going to replace gasoline with x or y it cuts out all those smart people and instead replaces them with a lobby thats only purpose is to keep the subsidies flowing

6187103 we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet
6187104 using the information provided by comcast pursuant to this order as well as information submitted by the public we will closely monitor the companys network management practices
6187105 current p2p management is triggered regardless of the level of overall network congestion and regardless of the time of day
6187106 entitled to run applications and use services of their choice
6187107 will not hesitate to take action to address their conduct
6187108 if cable companies such as comcast are barred from inhibiting consumer access to high definition on line video content
6187109 consumers with cable modem service will have available a source of video programming much of it free that could rapidly become an alternative to cable television
6187110 from discriminatory to nondiscriminatory network management practices by the end of the year
6187111 including the thresholds that will trigger any limits on customers access to bandwidth
6187112 our overriding aim here is to end comcasts use of unreasonable network practices
6187113 and our remedy sends the unmistakable message that comcasts conduct must stop
6187114 as you can imagine well need to review the order
6187115 so all we can say right now is we are examining the order and evaluating our options
6187116 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to unfettered internet access

6187156 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6187157 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6187158 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6187159 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6187160 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6187161 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6187162 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize

6187164 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6187185 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6187186 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6187192 quando um pa s importa produtos de outros pa ses importante ter consci ncia do impacto gerado sobre os recursos de gua nas regi es em que estes produtos foram produzidos
6187193 por exemplo uma camisa produzida com algod o cultivado no paquist o ou no uzbequist o requer 2 7 mil litros de gua numa regi o que j apresenta sinais de escassez
6187194 no caso do brasil importante que o governo as empresas e os consumidores tenham maior consci ncia deste impacto preciso saber onde e em que condi es estes produtos s o produzidos
6187195 se um produto produzido em uma regi o amea ada h duas alternativas ou discutir formas de melhorar o gerenciamento local da gua ou mudar de fornecedor o que n o podemos fazer exportar nossos problemas para outros pa ses e consumir gua de regi es amea adas
6187196 o que nos preocupa particularmente que enormes quantidades destes produtos s o cultivadas em regi es mais secas do mundo onde os recursos da gua ou j est o amea ados ou muito provavelmente estar o sob amea a no futuro pr ximo
6187197 progresso e perspectivas sobre a gua por um mundo limpo e saud vel com especial aten o ao saneamento

6187201 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6187202 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6187203 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6187204 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6187205 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6187206 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6187207 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6187208 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6187209 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6187210 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6187211 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6187212 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6187213 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6187214 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6187215 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6187216 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6187217 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake

6187312 the bank has an even higher burden around fraud detection
6187313 it would be incorrect to say that there is no potential for fraud our responsibility and i think we meet that is to be sure that we stay abreast of the security protocols and the security activities that will make the transactions as secure as absolutely possible

6187322 for the withdrawal of russian troops to happen two things are necessary the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again

6187419 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6187420 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6187421 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6187422 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6187423 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6187424 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6187425 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6187426 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6187453 this is where you have to keep your poise worthington comes into the game hes a guy who has no value to the australians except maybe to get one of the better american players thrown out
6187454 bryant shot 17 37 459 from three point range last summer when team usa went 10 0 en route to winning the gold medal in the fiba americas tournament and he shot 7 19 368 from three point range when team usa went 5 0 during their pre olympic exhibition tour that adds up to 24 56 429 three point shooting during his 15 fiba games prior to the olympics bryant shot 361 from the 23 9 nba three point distance last season and is a 340 career nba three point shooter in other words at some point he is going to have a 6 8 game from the three point line and by the end of the olympics his three point shooting percentage will be around its normal level
6187455 the three point line now in fiba play thats where i shoot fadeaways from

6187465 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6187466 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6187467 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6187468 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6187469 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6187470 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6187471 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6187472 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6187473 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6187474 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6187475 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6187476 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6187477 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6187478 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6187479 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6187480 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6187481 we apologise for any offense caused earlier today when bryony shaw swore live on air having just won an olympic bronze medal in the windsurfing event
6187482 our reporter on the spot rob walker apologised immediately and adrian chiles apologised again when the footage cut back to the studio
6187483 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6187484 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6187485 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6187486 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6187487 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6187488 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6187489 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6187490 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6187491 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6187492 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6187493 i looked up knee replacement in india on the internet and thats when i came across medical tourism corporation at that stage i had still not made up my mind though but the quick responses and extremely professional communication from medical tourism corporation helped me discuss the matter with my family members and arrive at a collective decision
6187494 all questions that i had were answered and even before i went there i got to see the resume of the doctor who would treat me dr sanjay pai and was very impressed he had 18 years of experience in his field that was very reassuring
6187495 it was very fulfilling to get the treatment in that hospital the quality of medical care was extremely high the nurses showed good training and high ethical values
6187496 the medical team was simply superb the anesthetists were good too and dr pai was an astounding team leader
6187497 i used to go for long walks with my husband and friends and havent been able to do that for some time now so i look forward to all that
6187498 i am very impressed with the highly professional way in which medical tourism corporation helped me throughout the time i was in india people from the corporation kept calling me from the us asking how i was doing and if there was anything i wanted i think that was very very fulfilling

6187501 basin electric and bsc have a longstanding relationship much of which is centered on the colleges highly reputable power plant technology program
6187502 with base load power plants in north dakota and wyoming many bsc graduates take root at basin electric facilities
6187503 we are offering up to five students an opportunity to complete their job shadowing requirements plus an 80 hour internship at each of our facilities
6187504 this program allows students and basin electric the opportunity to see if were a good fit for each other it also allows us access to top students and reduces training time and recruitment costs should we bring the interns on full time
6187505 we are excited that basin electric is offering this wonderful opportunity to our power plant program students
6187506 this is an excellent example of collaboration between industry and education to provide a direct benefit to students
6187507 during the past five years basin electric and dakota gasification company had 281 openings at our facilities with educational requirements of a two year degree or less of these 281 openings we hired 166 bsc grads thats 59 percent
6187508 basin electric has provided tremendous support to bismarck state college and continues to be a valued partner

6187515 we want to reach out to people who dont have a smartphone not people who already love rim
6187516 going forward for premium fully featured devices wi fi is a requirement
6187517 ill be more equipped to answer that as the season gets going but right now yeah hes a very powerful player he can change the line of scrimmage and hes a very smart football player too as a defensive lineman he kind of reminds me of and i shouldnt say it of dt warren sapp that way because warren was very smart as far as blocking combinations and things of that nature hes just learning its a different game in the pro game than college hes going to practice and play against a lot of good guards and hes playing against on every day in g brian waters so maybe thats helping him
6187518 we havent decided how were going to do that we wont decide maybe until tomorrow hopefully hell be okay to play into the third quarter thats the key to go into halftime and come back out and let those guys play most of those guys that we anticipate to start havent really done that yet
6187519 yeah it does but here again this is the third year in a row that ive been here that your offensive line has never been in practice together never put the pads on with each other its okay since it gives other guys opportunities but youd like them to all be there they were in the spring but its different in the spring its not pads hopefully he gets well and stays well and hopefully he doesnt get nicked and hopefully we get our other guy back too
6187520 i dont know whos starting over there yet well take some guys in and out of there for sure
6187521 i think hes going to be fine hes going to be a good player the thing you never lose sight of is mental toughness and you have to have mental toughness if youre going to play that position he has that hes playing against two pro bowl receivers thats a pretty good days work he did fairly well last time i checked he didnt give up a touchdown the first group has only given up nine points in two games that aint all bad right now if they can do that during the second half of the game it would be pretty good id like our odds at winning some of those games i just think hell keep growing along with the rest of these guys theres peaks and valleys for them thats part of football some weeks theyll look real good and some weeks they might have a bad day or two but theyll have to come out of it and continue to play were not going to change were not going to bring a boatload of veteran players in here at the final cut this is basically our football team there might be one or two guys that we bring in but i promise you it wont be that way its going to be these guys and theyre going to play and theyre going to be good players
6187522 its been okay last week i thought we hit the quarterback some which is good but you always can do it a couple ways if you have a really good front four then you rush that way if not then youve got to come from somewhere else if you have good linebackers that can rush you can bring five or even six now if you do that youre going to have to play man to man and youre going to have to have some corners that can cover well we drafted some guys and weve got some guys here that we think can do that so if we need pressure were going to have to blitz sometimes and let those guys play man to man
6187523 one thing you learn in this league whether youre a coach or a player especially on the coaching side is when you lose a very good player you never look at it as we have to replace this guy youre never going to replace him what you have to do is go okay we got rid of this guy now what do we do now you dont put the pressure on another player you just say okay we replaced this player we got some good players in return that made us better at a couple other positions and well go with it that way well find a way to get to the quarterback in a perfect world youd like to rush four every time but most teams cant do that you use a linebacker and safeties that are going to blitz you can even bring corners if you want
6187524 hes been doing well he started off slow with the new system a lot was put on him we found something out about him that he could rush the quarterback hes a good blitzer he and lb pat thomas both are good blitzers and dj lb derrick johnson is too hes starting to learn what to do in the system hes very athletic hes very fast and he can run plays down thats whats kind of unique about all three of those guys dj pat and demorrio they can run plays down
6187525 things come on you a lot faster at guard you dont have any room for error because things happen a lot faster at guard at tackle you have a little bit of a time period to adjust the pulling part is probably the biggest part for him tackles really dont pull a lot hes a very good pass protector and he can still play tackle hes a guy that can do both hes gotten better every week hes starting to adjust to playing in there
6187526 if something happens you never know weve got some guys that are versatile enough to go out there and play well just have to see
6187527 confidence i think all those guys that were rookies last year theyre a lot more confident i think thats the way this team is going to develop theres a lot of guys when you look at them now they have a lot more confidence in their ability and what in what were asking them to do thats what football is all about thats what lifes about being confident about what you do
6187528 i dont know that well wait and see theres not a lot of those guys around theyre hard to find they really are no one knew who jared allen was he was a fourth round pick it took him four years to develop that skill this guy is only in his second year youve got to give a guy a chance you cant expect these guys to come in here right away and just set the league on fire most guys dont do that theres a learning curve some learn faster than others but the thing that these guys have is the ability to get better they want to get better theyre good students in the classrooms and theyve got some god given talent they push themselves and that ends up being the difference between a guy thats a great player and a guy that is kind of up and down his whole career thats the players choice thats not coaching god gives you talent what you do with it is your choice the coach can coach you so much then eventually youve got to do something with it thats kind of how it works in life too last time i checked
6187529 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

6187570 mugabe is a bad person and bad leader tsvangirai is a good person but is not a good leader whilst some protest musicians have taken political sides it is very healthy and important for me to remain non partisan otherwise the people we sing for will be deprived of the truth since pro political party musicians tend to be biased and speak only good about the masters that they sing for in many known cases they exaggerate and give masses wrong impressions which is not good for socio political progress for example the mdc t mayor of chitungwiza israel marange was arrested for corruption and it is important that someone sings about it otherwise it will be water under the bridge i understand that this album will give birth to a new breed of haters since zimbabweans are generally truth haters but with time people will understand and appreciate my stance
6187571 i was shocked and frightened when one tsvangirai supporter said dying for tsvangirai is his choice which should be respected and its his democratic right when i queried his stupidity he said to me
6187572 this supporters statement is one of the many thuggish and irresponsible statements by many mdc supporters some of the supporters are so barbaric and violent minded and i wonder what will become of zimbabwe incase tsvangirai becomes president some mdc supporters treat tsvangirai like a god and use all sorts of foul language to verbally abuse those who speak against their president this is very wrong if such kind of fanaticism is not stopped it will become a deadly disease whose remedy is bloodshed rape corruption and all the bad things that we see in zanu pf now zimbabwe doesnt need this zanu pf mentality anymore moreso there is only one god and treating leaders like god should be despised at all costs if mdc is also fighting for the so called democracy then they should respect responsible freedom of speech and opinion by allowing us to free our voices and our minds sometime back some of the mdc supporters even threatened me saying i should stop singing protest songs because the genre was for mdc cadres only
6187573 how can human beings and inhuman beings work together its like mixing water with oil why would someone in their normal senses even think of talking with mugabe and hope to come up with a progressive move mugabe is a mad man whose language and actions are best understood by psychiatrics
6187574 the title track zimbabwe circus summarises the fact that zimbabwes mess is like a circus everything seems to be mixed up political parties are making a whole lot of errors stupid and selfish decisions a lot is going on so much that it is difficult to tell what will happen next to sum it up zanu pf remains a party of unrepentant crooks and evil doers but funny enough tsvangirai and mutambara agreed to talk with them by signing the mou agreement the signing of mou is a circus on its own why should people sign to agree to talk as if that is not enough the talks included negotiators who were not voted for by the people the fact that mdc mutambara is involved in the talks makes me wonder why there were votes in the first place if those who failed to qualify for the presidential run off are involved that said why did tsvangirai agree to be involved in the talks that included mutambara only for his supporters to cry foul after rumours that mutambara had signed a power sharing deal with mugabe started spreading its all their leaders fault who agreed to go ahead with the talks that allowed mutambara to be part of the deal when he was not supposed to be in it according to the logic behind it all so they should stop terrorizing and blaming mutambara but they should blame their leader for not querying mutambaras presence the fact that tsvangirai did not raise any concerns about it implies that all was good making mutambara eligible for any post granted to him by those involved its all mixed up and senseless

6187586 the event has attracted massive publicity and as such we anticipate that the local police and security bureau will have beijing well locked down so that general security risks are likely to be mitigated and therefore not a major concern for the general public attending the events
6187587 we have recently seen a large backlash against china from various factions protesting about chinas human rights record who may well attempt to use the mass media coverage of the games to publicise their cause and attempt to disrupt the event should any such incident occur it is possible that attendees may be caught up and as such should be on the look out for anything they instinctively feel is not right or suspicious
6187588 consider the fact that such large crowds of visitors unfamiliar with beijing will attract pickpockets fraudsters and other petty criminals some popular scams to be aware of are offers of taxi services not from authorised taxi pick up points or requests to have a drink with a friendly local in order to help him improve his english skills

6187596 another reason is that its simply more fun just watch children in a ready steady move lesson
6187597 in hungary like elsewhere children spend too much time watching television or sitting in front of a computer also because of the reduction in phys ed lessons in schools parents are enthused about enrolling their children in a fun all inclusive movement class that also helps them practice english

6187606 the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and keep it

6187611 when kris and i hired our first employee nearly five years ago i knew that we embarked on something big very big i just didnt know how big the irony of pepperjams success is that from those first days to the present day our team comes into the office everyday with the attitude that weve only just gotten started

6187629 raising some more angel investment now 25 100k investor up to 500k
6187630 several of our users have asked in the past if there was a way they could invest so decided to let my followers know on twitter that there might be an opportunity to invest
6187631 we care if the investor is an accredited investor or not we have strict requirements for investment all of our current investors and all investors in this round would be required to be qualified investors all potential investors would have to pass the standard suitability test for such an early stage investment
6187632 he made them redesign the battery panel on the back so it didnt squeak and he asked for fixes to the software so it would lock up less frequently
6187633 people act like its their right to drive whether theyre licensed or not
6187634 they dont care and they put other people at risk as a result
6187635 it seems as if we as a society have raised a white flag of surrender and are willing to accept that these losses are the price we have to pay for the mobility we enjoy in this country

6187637 theres two solar industries theres a solar industry of the individual and i dont want to invest in that at all first solar is an industrial company they are not one to one they use large available pieces of real estate and they put their film solar panels on top of those and then sell the electricity theyre going to win a series of very big contracts theres no future for that one to one market its going to be industrial and only first solar right now is playing it when i say only there are others coming on which is an other reason why first solars multiple could shrink eventually
6187638 the rising cost of materials and labor has the potential to put an end to the nuclear renaissance before it ever gets started

6187641 there is in the short term a recognition that there should be an area where russia can conduct some additional military activities but that is a temporary measure until the osce monitors are in place and can do the job that russian forces would otherwise have to do
6187642 and then that is to be followed in turn in principle by a peacekeeping force so this is not a carte blanche
6187643 a right to have a military and we should all be working on how we can help them rebuild after the damage that has been inflicted
6187644 what happens between now and then including russias actions will make a difference
6187645 to actually have a chance for my dream to come true is really something

6187651 our assessment shows that there are no fundamental flaws that would impede the rehabilitation of charity hospital into a state of the art modern facility
6187652 big charity is one of the premier examples of art deco architecture in new orleans and its rehabilitation would provide the most sustainable way to create a contemporary hospital while preserving a key part of the citys history the re use of this iconic historic landmark would be a symbol of new orleans rebirth
6187653 charity hospital has the potential to be a very good healthcare facility in its design floor space and close connection to a community with serious healthcare needs
6187654 i walked into this place for the first time on a wet july morning in 2005 and thought yes this is it
6187655 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6187656 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons
6187657 his injuries were the result of a lightning strike that hit the ground and travelled to where the worker was standing he was taken to kgh
6187658 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6187659 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6187660 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6187661 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6187662 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made
6187663 to the people that ive served with here for three years and we sure dont always agree i have enjoyed working with each and every one of you and disagreeing with each and every one of you
6187664 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age
6187665 we are taking the necessary steps to understand exactly which repairs are needed so that the building can be enjoyed for many years to come
6187666 in addition the mechanical electrical and sprinkler systems are nearing the end of their service life the building also needs upgrades to meet current codes for accessibility
6187667 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6187668 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
6187669 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials go to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone

6187672 we kept the ball really well in the first half played the ball about well and deservedly went in a goal in front
6187673 good football became impossible in the second half because of the state of the pitch and the heavy rain completely spoiled the game
6187674 we can take plenty of positives into our first qualifier against georgia
6187675 we created some good chances in the first period but the conditions ruined the game in the second half as there was no fluidity to the play and it became a lottery
6187676 things are looking good for our first world cup qualifier in georgia and i am confident that we can do well
6187677 our initial experience in working with omnicomm was very favorable and as a result we chose to use them in our next trial we were impressed with their responsiveness and professionalism throughout the entire negotiation and study build process

6187682 the lesson plans are fun adventure stories designed to complement the meals that are served daily
6187683 the goal is to educate children about a balanced diet and the value of all the food groups in a way that they can relate to the plans are designed to encourage healthful choices not only now but also throughout their lives
6187684 the meals really are now part of the early education program
6187685 our hope is that this will make it easy for kids and parents to learn sound nutrition via the stories and the homework
6187686 good nutrition is extremely important for young children but existing lunch programs often dont provide the essentials
6187687 and sack lunches from home also usually lack the nutrition a child needs for lunch
6187688 we see the lessons plans as added value to the lunches
6187689 its a good addition to the service and the children really enjoy the lessons and the take home worksheets its going over very well
6187690 quality nutritious food choices are the gift a caregiver provides to encourage optimal growth and development of a child
6187691 were doing this at no cost to the childcare centers because we believe so strongly in the need for proper nutrition
6187692 i know of no other meal provider that offers a nutrition education along with the meal service

6187706 now that that stage of growth is absorbed we have also focused on identifying and redefining past business strategies to improve cost controls while increasing marketing and most importantly our profitability we are excited to now implement more cost effective methods to distribute socko in the u s and internationally product acceptance has been very encouraging and socko is already becoming one of the fastest growing independent energy brand beverages in the u s

6187734 theres probably more complexity on the chip than they expected
6187735 generally whenever you have an extended schedule it usually means theres some challenges in the design or with the supporting chipsets amd learned that lesson with barcelona when youre trying to put four cores or more on a chip you tend to run into some kind of trouble
6187736 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6187737 we want to be on location there are many questions
6187738 save the males why men matter why women should care
6187739 a culture that is hostile toward males contemptuous of masculinity and cynical about the delightful differences that make men irresistible
6187740 in film and music men are variously portrayed as dolts bullies brutes deadbeats rapists sexual predators and wife beaters
6187741 are invariably cast at best as bumbling dim witted fools
6187742 by elevating single motherhood from an unfortunate consequence of poor planning to a sophisticated act of self fulfillment we have helped to fashion a world in which fathers are not just scarce but in which men are superfluous
6187743 its absolutely necessary that i find out who he is to have a normal existence in any way it would be nice if he wanted to meet me but that would be something i want rather than something needed
6187744 by indulging every appetite instead of recognizing the importance of self control and commitment young men encounter little resistance against continuing to celebrate juvenile pursuits losing themselves in video games and mindless guy oriented tv fare and casual sex
6187745 as long as men feel marginalized by the women whose favors and approval they seek as long as they are alienated from their children and treated as criminals by family courts as long as they are disrespected by a culture that no longer values masculinity tied to honor and as long as boys are bereft of strong fathers and our young men and women wage sexual war then we risk cultural suicide
6187746 whether women are better than men i cannot say but i can say they are certainly no worse
6187747 if the baseballs have psa or jsa certs ebay is ok any other certs and i would be very cautious said brian marren vice president of acquisitions for www mastroauctions com auctions in chicago
6187748 if an inexperienced collector turns to ebay to start his collection he should stick with pieces that originated with reputable firms said mike breeden an autograph expert and editor of tuff stuffs autograph guide
6187749 id buy only pieces that carried a hologram from one of the companies you mention psa jsa and perhaps a few others the coa itself in this day and age isnt enough it should have a hologram from the manufacturer or a reputable third party the third party holograms arent infallible but sticking with psa and jsa will certainly dramatically lessen the chances of buying a forgery
6187750 assuming the richter signed stick is real it is worth around 1 500 said mike heffner president of www
6187751 can such a belligerent state be trusted as the guarantor of europes energy supply
6187752 we already have more than half of doctors not taking medi cal patients because of low reimbursement rates so the additional rate cut was going to further reduce access to care for millions of children parents seniors and people with disabilities
6187753 weve always said these are difficult but necessary cuts in order for the state to close its 15 billion budget deficit
6187754 i think all the way along many of us have thought this was not a good idea because reimbursement rates already are very low and a cut could be the straw that breaks the camels back in physicians and nursing homes deciding not to cover medi cal patients
6187755 right now we have such a big budget hole that we are at loggerheads in resolving that its always difficult when somebody makes the hole bigger
6187756 it looks like the judge recognized that these people have no access and certainly not equal access to services at least not the way the federal program was envisioned
6187757 its kind of a pathetic way of doing things but i did make the talk
6187758 and when youre in a tight race you want to present your candidate as a well packaged well controlled image that has been constructed based on careful poll taking and focus groups now thats just the way it is if you dont play that game maybe you dont win
6187759 at the very least there could be a debate about something
6187760 they didnt call me moonbeam for nothing i worked hard to get that
6187761 taking money from the very forces that will make it impossible to carry through programs
6187762 hes like the dinner guest you wished you never invited
6187763 i want everyone to know this campaign is about real change were not here to get along and go along
6187764 an obscure governor with a lot of insider contacts who has been propelled by money
6187765 so this reform which started out as oh these bad party bosses now actually goes to the financial leadership
6187766 those with money and the organizations that can spend money they dominate so its becoming dysfunctional based on the reform going to excess
6187767 union busting wage depressing scab inviting environmental disaster of a governor
6187768 the way these conventions and primary nomination processes work very early on the leading candidate wants to put it to bed over and everything else becomes scripted
6187769 and i felt that i had a message a message of reform and i wanted to speak at the convention but before doing that you had to pledge your fealty your loyalty to the winner i didnt feel like doing that
6187770 the irritated clinton camp is barely able to find mr brown much less negotiate the terms of his surrender
6187771 on saturday night mr brown phoned mr clinton but immediately put him on hold while answering another call after five minutes on hold even the eager to please mr clinton hung up only to discover that neither his staff nor the party chief ron brown knew how to reach the elusive mr jerry brown
6187772 i was told that casey was not to be on the platform was not to give a speech and that was the end of it
6187773 everything is reviewed by a team of people who are sitting in the bowels of the convention center speechwriters
6187774 and they review every speech before it goes up on the tele prompter they also write some speeches for people
6187775 oh the democrats or republicans dont know what theyre doing theyve got this fight going on
6187776 and its a show that you dont want too much disruption because that looks a little unruly and we want our candidates controlled and if theres any unruliness its supposed to be packaged not spontaneous or unpredicted or unscripted so there we are its a great american tradition but it sure isnt what it was a few years ago
6187777 having the federal recognition restored will allow us that government to government status
6187778 california has sent a clear message today our state stands in solidarity with the winnemem wintu tribe to correct a terrible injustice by the federal government
6187779 if we were seeking a casino we would have one already
6187780 this result is a crushing defeat for randy dorn and his out of state war chest
6187781 a less vocal population is satisfied with the high standards and accountability
6187782 unfortunately we had to abandon the rest of the meeting as the track is waterlogged in places and there is no prospect of it drying out
6187783 it is obviously disappointing both for the connections of the horses and the whole team so i am so sorry about that
6187784 its hugely frustrating and to be beaten by the elements is a very humbling experience
6187785 we have had an unbelievable amount of rainfall and the course could just not take any more
6187786 we are very sorry for everybody but i feel especially sorry for william and his team as they have worked incredibly hard
6187787 it is also very disappointing to hear suggestions about our motives for racing to be abandoned
6187788 there is no financial incentive for us to abandon we are here to race and we want to race and in the sense that we are a not for profit organisation then the whole committee does want to race
6187789 we are all here as we love racing and we love racing at york the decision we had today was if the track was raceable on thursday and whether it was worth going through the agonises of prolonging it for another day and the possibility of racing friday and saturday
6187790 you only have to look at the level of the river and the water table and the further severe weather warning we have just received for more rain
6187791 in life you always have difficult decisions but this one was quite straightforward
6187792 totesport are delighted to sponsor the replacement race for the totesport ebor now scheduled to be run at newbury
6187793 of course there is only one ebor and that race can only ever be run at york but the totesport newburgh handicap the original norman name for newbury will give the owners and trainers another opportunity to win a valuable staying handicap over the same trip
6187794 we are obviously disappointed to lose this weeks ebor meeting at york but look forward to renewing our association with this prestigious and historic race again next season
6187795 ruth quinn director of racing has performed minor miracles in getting this done at such short notice
6187796 a lot of the sponsors have been fantastic and the owners and trainers she has spoken to have in the main been incredibly helpful
6187797 out of the loss of a four day meeting like this there are some wonderful positives to racing in terms of what people can do in a crisis and this is a crisis
6187798 our technology and product pipeline are strong throughout our broad portfolio and we are seeing good competitive momentum
6187799 even at a time of increased customer caution around spending synopsys continues to perform well
6187800 you are living on rickys land and you must go
6187801 doesnt a couple more hours of sleep eat into my personal time
6187802 it will not be a problem to get this legislature to come back and deal with it weve crossed that threshold
6187803 i think the governors approach to share the pain if you will to cut a little bit across the board is the right approach
6187804 its surprising because of all the media attention on some of the big falls but there has actually been a reduction in falls
6187805 but then again i was surprised last year at how little media attention we received because it was one of the worst years on record in terms of construction accidents
6187806 un internaute sur trois achetant en donnant suite un spam
6187807 so we are in the process of planning our sons adulthood which likely means leaving the state unless things dramatically improve

6187815 wir haben zwei kriege eine energiekrise und eine konjunktur die am rand einer ernsthaften krise taumelt ist das etwa der wahlkampf den john mccain f hren will
6187816 go out and practice and then after that more practice
6187817 the principal goal of the legislation which we are totally supportive of is transparency
6187818 people dont buy textbooks for the rest of their lives
6187819 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
6187820 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
6187821 health care costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6187822 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
6187823 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6187824 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6187825 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6187826 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6187827 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
6187828 if the monitoring isnt good enough the whole system falls apart
6187829 affects every major stationary air pollution source in the country this is a very important case just in terms of the publics right to know and guarding the publics opportunity to keep tabs
6187830 determine the appropriate course of action once the review is complete we are still assessing the implications of the decision
6187831 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution
6187832 by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards
6187833 if you have a 10 percent cut at a place like dulles the typical passenger doesnt feel it
6187834 if you have a 10 percent cut at a smaller airport all of a sudden boom it might mean one of their five flights is going or two of their five flights is gone
6187835 after labor day its no secret that we will be looking at another set of capacity reductions
6187836 by entering new markets especially alt a and subprime and guaranteeing more of our customers products at market prices we met our goal of increasing market share from 22 to 25 percent
6187837 he has had access to british tv in his hotel and knows that if he does come back to the uk he might never be able to leave again
6187838 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6187839 women did not create the glass ceiling the invisible barrier blamed for limiting their ability to earn what theyre worth but they help maintain it
6187840 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
6187841 they believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them on salary and status par with their male counterparts
6187842 good work is important but good work alone does not as the myth says speak for itself you have to give it a voice
6187843 this led many women in the study to actually prefer male managers to female managers claiming men are more consistent and fair minded than women
6187844 they are the largest group of african american male instructors who not only serve as male role models for the cadets but other african kids in the schools
6187845 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under marc anthony who also became parents of twins this year

6187852 experts are telling us that the profile of fans that follow pete doherty and babyshambles is volatile and they can easily be whipped up into a frenzy whereas the profile of someone that would follow around cliff richard or bucks fizz for example is completely different

6187856 lomba makan pizza saia mau banget tapi ga ada d
6187857 i think he brings to the system not only background as an educator but also his financial background and the fact that he was with the bureau of budget management amp research
6187858 this bill would rally be in conflict with the jurisdiction of the public utilities commission in

6187864 is a very tough way to begin the new school year
6187865 we just know that god would want us to press on to carry on and do the best we can under these tragic conditions
6187866 a very tough time for us this evening as we learned about the accident the prayers of the entire university community are with kelly roggensacks parents and sisters tonight
6187867 we are now making plans for a memorial mass for kelly when all of our students return to the campus she was a sophomore and returning student and we want to give all of our students the chance to come together to grieve
6187868 the accident remains under investigation at this point we have experts coming in to assist the troopers in their investigation
6187869 i was deeply saddened to learn of kellys tragic death
6187870 the entire university family mourns her loss and is praying for the repose of her soul and for the consolation of her family and friends
6187871 she was highly thought of by everyone who knew her the cross country team members had nothing but kind words for her it is hard to measure how deep this loss is to all of us
6187872 from here we mourn together as a university and we mourn together as the city of steubenville
6187873 mijn vrouw luistert naar de telefoon maar ze denkt erover na wat ik schrijf ik schrijf snel ze vroeg me wat ik schreef ik deed mijn schrift voor haar dicht want ze wil graag lezen wat ik schrijf ze is bezorgd om mij en daarom wil ze niet dat ik schrijf ik wil schrijven want ik houd van schrijven ik wil vandaag veel schrijven want ik wil veel zeggen ik kan niet snel schrijven maar mijn hand schrijft snel ik schrijf al beter want ik word niet gauw moe mijn handschrift is duidelijk ik schrijf goed leesbaar ik wil nog meer schrijven maar ik wil dat mijn vrouw slaapt ze kan niet in slaap komen ze is nerveus ze heeft zin om te slapen omdat ze denkt ze heeft geen zin om te slapen omdat ze niet slaapt
6187874 ik heb veel meegemaakt en daarom wil ik het opschrijven alles wat ik heb meegemaakt was een en al verschrikking ik ben bang voor de mensen want ze voelen me niet aan maar ze begrijpen me ik ben bang voor de mensen want ze willen dat ik net zon leven leid als zij leiden ze willen dat ik vrolijke dingen dans ik houd niet van vrolijkheid ik houd van het leven mijn vrouw ligt naast me te slapen en ik schrijf mijn vrouw slaapt niet want haar ogen zijn open ik streelde haar ze voelt mij goed aan ik schrijf slecht omdat ik het moeilijk heb mijn vrouw zucht want zij voelt mij aan
6187875 ik rook plotseling een stank de stank kwam uit de kamer ik keek naar binnen en zag het een smerige wc was ik barstte bijna in tranen uit want ik dacht dat ik in een smerige wc moest slapen ik ging de straat op de straat was verlaten ik liep verder plotseling voelde ik een beweging naar links en ik volgde die ik liep langs een slechte weg een eindje verder zag ik een laag witgekalkt huisje ik liep in die richting ik ging bij het huisje langs en vond de eigenares het was een eenvoudige vrouw haar kleren waren gescheurd
6187876 de mens is natuur de aap is niet de natuur van de mens ik ben geen aap in een mens de aap is god in de natuur want hij heeft gevoel voor bewegingen ik heb gevoel voor bewegingen mijn bewegingen zijn eenvoudig de bewegingen van een aap zijn ingewikkeld een aap is dom ik ben dom maar ik bezit rede ik ben een redelijk wezen en een aap is niet redelijk ik denk dat de aap afstamt van de boom en de mens van god god is geen aap de mens is god de mens heeft armen en de aap ook
6187877 we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet
6187878 using the information provided by comcast pursuant to this order as well as information submitted by the public we will closely monitor the companys network management practices
6187879 current p2p management is triggered regardless of the level of overall network congestion and regardless of the time of day
6187880 entitled to run applications and use services of their choice
6187881 will not hesitate to take action to address their conduct
6187882 if cable companies such as comcast are barred from inhibiting consumer access to high definition on line video content
6187883 consumers with cable modem service will have available a source of video programming much of it free that could rapidly become an alternative to cable television
6187884 from discriminatory to nondiscriminatory network management practices by the end of the year
6187885 including the thresholds that will trigger any limits on customers access to bandwidth
6187886 our overriding aim here is to end comcasts use of unreasonable network practices
6187887 and our remedy sends the unmistakable message that comcasts conduct must stop
6187888 as you can imagine well need to review the order
6187889 so all we can say right now is we are examining the order and evaluating our options
6187890 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to unfettered internet access
6187891 he wanted to have some type of animal not a dog
6187892 i kind of had a problem with that because it didnt seem like i could hide a dog

6187896 u s military and civilian personnel are credibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees
6187897 in every state governed by rule of law a victim of governmental abuse should have a remedy to bring a claim of reparation against the government thats a basic requirement of the rule of law
6187898 the rasul case was brought to establish a principle of accountability
6187899 we know that theres been an enormous amount of abuse its systemic not just a few rotten applies at abu ghraib but no one of any importance has ever been held accountable
6187900 these legal doctrines of immunity have no place where theres a clear military prohibition on this kind of conduct
6187901 mistreatment of prisoners is forbidden by the uniform code of military justice and its been outlawed going all the way back to george washington after the battle of trenton when he forbid the mistreatment of prussian mercenaries
6187902 intentional infliction of any suffering or disgrace by cruel imprisonment want of food by mutilation death or any other barbarity
6187903 violence to life and person mutilation cruel treatment and torture and outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment
6187904 a court may be more comfortable protecting someones interests to be free from unlawful imprisonment yet more reluctant to hold government officials liable
6187905 the most frustrating situation is where victims dont even get their day in court
6187906 claim of privilege a mysterious plane crash a landmark supreme court case and the rise of state secrets
6187907 victims of violations of common article 3 must have some remedy that compensates them and deters future violations
6187908 these people are having trouble moving ahead with their lives
6187909 if the government officials that were involved in drafting the torture memos that played a role in the policies in abu ghraib and elsewhere were not very cautious about their foreign travel
6187910 i cant imagine that john yoo for example would not be thinking about that and consulting with his own counsel before he travels anywhere
6187911 with a computer our customers can load the bread the night before program a finish time and get a perfect slice of toast when they awaken
6187912 we need some horsepower if were gonna program this puppy in c
6187913 time to market you know delivery is due in three months well just pop this cool new 8 bitter i found into it whip up some code and ship to the end user

6187916 this sucker has more computer power than the entire world did 20 years ago
6187917 toasting experience that can only come from a cisc based 32 bit multitasking machine running the latest multiplatform software
6187918 ja ets prou gran per saber ho lentrada obscena la sortida macabra lentrada gratis la sortida a garrotades creu me val la pena de llan ar un gargall ben esp s i amb tota la f ria mentre encara hi som a temps
6187919 a tu tagrada dir estirabots no tadones del mal que unes paraules poden fer unes paraules que sens escapen que deixem caure a la impensada poden obrir un pou als peus dun altre un pou sense fons i potser laltre pateix de vertigen
6187920 una vegada em deia que si aquesta guerra dur s prou temps al capdavall ens trobar em que tots els soldats republicans shavien passat als feixistes i viceversa
6187921 fugiu ben lluny de mentida negra per tamb de mentida roja la mentida s la reina daquest m n i ens sotja pertot sota els colors m s impensats la veritat s amor i en aix la coneixereu sempre no vulgueu res amb lodi que s el pare de la mentida

6187924 in the long history of humankind and animal kind too those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed
6187925 meetings are indispensable when you dont want to do anything
6187926 he who rejects change is the architect of decay the only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery
6187927 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6187928 its not just the housing picture that one has to fathom but its also public policy what is the government going to do
6187929 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6187930 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6187931 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6187932 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6187933 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6187934 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6187935 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6187936 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6187937 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6187938 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6187939 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6187940 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6187941 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6187942 i think justice was served for the boy and for his mother
6187943 and the family is relieved that its come to a conclusion and they can move forward the boy is in a safe environment and i hope the best for him
6187944 every time she tried to get away he beat her
6187945 she had the same type of burns her child had
6187946 we thought that was appropriate under the circumstances and was sufficient to hold him accountable and to punish him for the horrible acts against the child and the mother
6187947 in a horribly abusive relationship with a man who turned out to be a monster
6187948 all the people that have stepped into his life really appreciate all the donations
6187949 it will enrich his life and assist him in his life he is pretty much left with nothing but this trust fund
6187950 we have had people with nocturnal eating disorder who were put on ambien and they converted to nocturnal sleep disorder there may be a continuum
6187951 he wanted to have some type of animal not a dog
6187952 i kind of had a problem with that because it didnt seem like i could hide a dog
6187953 the boys did enough to win the game and we did not take our chances
6187954 we have proved we can score goals prior to this game its a golden opportunity that has passed us by tonight
6187955 we have got another chance out in romania which will be very difficult
6187956 romania have only conceded one goal in the competition and are a difficult team to play against and they showed us that respect and you have to take your chances at this level
6187957 the positive thing to take from the game is that we have shown romania that we are capable of beating them
6187958 hes quite the escape artist every time i open a door he tries to go through it
6187959 nous avons eu un temps assez bon et prosp re avec un faible taux de ch mage
6187960 le prix du gaz est en hausse le prix du lait est en hausse

6187966 they really looked like good pals he seemed happy to see her
6187967 shes the most discerning person ive ever met shell read a script 100 times shes relentless
6187968 a girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me
6187969 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6187970 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6187971 the addition of probiotics to our prebiotic multi grain crust will not effect taste and will enhance the nutritional profile of our great tasting immune boosting pizza this is a big deal for our business and consistent with our mission to demonstrate that pizza can be part of a healthy lifestyle

6187977 im not worried ive lived 62 years and never come close to dying of thirst

6187979 maam my body has a remarkably effective way of telling me when i need to drink i get thirsty
6187980 in the medical profession and i know what im talking about
6187981 the notion that there is widespread dehydration has no basis in medical fact
6187982 the current infatuation with water as an all purpose health potion tonic for the skin the key to weight loss etc is a blend of fashion and fiction but very little science
6187983 after catching two or three bluegill alyssa turns to me and says papa ive got to go to the bathroom hold my fishing rod
6187984 a few minutes later the float went under and i saw the water start boiling up i knew right then that i had my hands full with that fishing rod
6187985 which rookie back is the best one coming into the season
6187986 with mcfadden on the team do you think the raiders are a playoff team
6187987 well mcfadden well most certainly help their offense and russells going to be a big factor to oaklands success this year their defense is been very consistent the last few years they did have some drop off in sack production and overall production from the d line but oakland spent a ton of money this offseason on their defense with people like deangelo among others coming in they look to be even better this year well have to see how they do in september and if they come out of september 500 the skys the limit

6188203 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6188204 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6188205 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6188206 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

6188223 has a better understanding of the issues and concerns important to your generation
6188224 john mccain really is the senior guy in more terms than just his chronological age
6188225 the important thing is not that obama is underperforming with seniors its that hes doing so extraordinarily well with this young generation of women voters
6188226 in a moment when half of this electorate says im worried and uncertain for the future
6188227 john mccain has a bigger vision problem than senator obama has

6188294 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6188295 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6188296 some people may argue that the forum is unnecessary because of perception in some quarters that votes from third world do not really count in the u s a politics we are dismissing this with the wave of hand and urging our brothers and sisters in diaspora to vote it is heartwarming to note that five million of the africans in diaspora fall within voting age
6188297 t he event was a private thing and i used my own money to put it together some people like to sit in front of the television and watch history in the making but we chose to mobilise people to vote for someone we believe in
6188298 i am a very intelligent person i have a phd that i did not buy we were careful with our advertisements and we were transparent in all we did i dont understand why nigerians like to be negative people have been mobilising support for obama all over the world and they are not being castigated

6188340 i love shooting in toronto anyway but filmport makes it easier to convince producers and studios that this is a viable place to shoot because im never making a movie just on my own obviously im doing it with a lot of people so you need some weaponry when youre trying to convince people to shoot here instead of someplace else
6188341 the low dollar that we used to have was a big argument we dont have that at the moment so we need something else this filmport is that something else
6188342 weve had to stop shooting when it rained because the noise was too loud because the buildings werent sound proofed it would be much too hot in the summer much too cold in the winter

6188404 were not saying that production is going to be cut yet
6188405 those decisions with suppliers are going to be made at the conference next week
6188406 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6188407 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6188408 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6188409 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6188410 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6188411 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannie and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages

6188413 mccain did well because he understands the issues close to the hearts of the people at saddleback obama did poorly because he does not understand those issues and only built up the im a man of faith narrative to hide that fact
6188414 that as long as we do not all share the same religious beliefs the government has no business forcing one person to live by another persons faith it speaks to religious freedom and government intrusion two themes usually associated with narratives on the right but that should be central to a progressive narrative on abortion

6188421 weve got some inner city schools in this country that are almost as bad off as rwanda or guatemala if its such a powerful tool for engaging the interest of young kids in other countries why wouldnt it be equally effective for our own kids
6188422 the whole premise of the xo computer is to de emphasize the role of the teacher
6188423 in the u s a teacher tells you when to learn and how to learn the xo is set up to explore to use inquisitiveness to learn and then to teach other kids
6188424 there are a lot of people that will be interested in the results of these tests and experiments
6188425 we had to close it out early because of the high demand
6188426 even if we turn frisbee back to the town that process will take two to three years and these improvements would have already paid for themselves

6188431 my inquiry a couple of hours ago to an old college friend who works for one of the interested parties has indicated that there is more at play here than meets the eye and definitely more than just a kernel of truth to this rumor
6188432 for me to write i need certain conditions one of quiet isolation not a city
6188433 i was born not far from here so this weather is familiar i like the weather i like the growing season its a good place to work its really pleasant when im not here i think about it

6188435 i realized how much was revealed everything is revealed its political realities economic realities its human condition how i felt about a place in the past and how i feel now
6188436 with that trip i felt such a continuous sense of discovery self discovery and discovery i thought maybe the ultimate in this would be to take the same trip again a trip that had meant a lot to me in 1973
6188437 the sort of place that gives rise to the notion that the earth is flat
6188438 a great meal a binge a visit from card players an intrigue a good nights sleep and strangers monologues framed like russian short stories

6188440 and theroux happened to be there at the start saying im opening up the door to this wanderlust in the american soul
6188441 i never saw myself as someone like faulkner who was writing about his home the people he knew at home his patch of landscape
6188442 i never really felt that writing about medford massachusetts had a future
6188443 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates
6188444 the longer i stayed in bangalore the less i liked it
6188445 the place had not evolved it had been crudely transformed less city planning than the urban equivalent of botched cosmetic surgery
6188446 likeliest solution to survival in an overcrowded world an almost robotic obedience decorum rigidity order with no frills
6188447 it didnt look like this it didnt smell like this it wasnt as crowded as this at night the roads were totally empty it was like the twilight zone going through the darkness
6188448 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them
6188449 in a way you cant be a writer unless you have sort of a personality problem balanced people dont become writers obviously balanced people become gardeners they raise happy families they go to work every day they smile they have noodle salad

6188468 this campaign is like 1988 and obama will continue to be buried a pile of sleaze but not fight back
6188469 this campaign is like 2000 and 2004 where the dem nominee will make a variety of mistakes and struggle in a tight campaign all the way to the end
6188470 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6188471 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6188472 it elicited all the weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth that id hoped it would

6188484 ele n o me ligou n o tive contato com ele para ser justo e coerente com a verdade eu nos quatro anos e oito meses de pol cia federal e mais agora quase um ano de abin jamais o secret rio gilberto carvalho fez qualquer contato comigo eu s tive contato com o secret rio eventualmente quando fui ao pal cio e apenas de cumprimentos seria uma leviandade da minha parte se afirmasse qualquer coisa em contr rio

6188486 evidente que alguns procuraram politizar as reuni es h um jogo de grupos pol ticos natural que ocorra o jogo mas h o local para isso ser feito
6188487 what we havent had is the political will to raise the taxes necessary to make these high payoff public investments
6188488 the idea that every dollar collected in taxes is a dollar lost from the economy is nothing but political propaganda
6188489 but because of the recent rains that rainfall deficit wont cause any new problems unless we turn dry again for a while
6188490 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

6188499 i think homeowners increasingly recognize that its in their best interest to have energy efficient products
6188500 people come in and their first question is should i switch to a front loader
6188501 they like the technology and when you sweeten it by saying theyll be using less water and energy then it closes the deal in their mind
6188502 this was the first time anyone has measured the properties of these hypothetical foods to see if they match what weve been inferring from the fossil record
6188503 our data for bulbs and corms fit most researchers expectations for the physical properties of hominin foods what we found in some ways merely confirmed the obvious
6188504 mechanical properties of plant underground storage organs and implications for dietary models of early hominins

6188512 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6188513 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6188514 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6188515 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6188516 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy

6188518 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6188519 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6188520 obviously it is frustrating when guns injure or kill people but when a young person is hurt it is a deeper blow
6188521 we are making strides but at times your success is punctuated by incidents like this that show how much more work there is to be done

6188555 die verwaltung ergreift einseitig position f r volkswagen und tut so als handele es sich bei der guntherstra e um ein gewerbegebiet
6188556 wenn die bewohner der siegfriedstra e erfahren dass neben den 34 stra enbahnen zus tzlich 80 lastwagen t glich ber ihre stra e rollen sollen dann werden wir schnell mehr
6188557 es gab keine abstimmung die verwaltung hat alles allein entschieden

6188570 can i share a personal conviction i think vision is the cure for sin one reason many of us get entangled in sin is because we dont have enough god ordained vision to keep us busy
6188571 the more vision you have the less you will sin and the less vision you have the more you will sin it is a vision that keeps us playing offense spiritually
6188572 too often we try to stop sinning by not sinning that is what psychologists call a double bind its sort of like saying be spontaneous you cant be spontaneous now that ive told you to be the way to stop sinning is not by focusing on not sinning the way to stop sinning is by getting a god sized vision that consumes all your time and energy
6188573 it is crucial we stop these men from hurting anyone else
6188574 this couple have not only been injured by these vicious men but have been attacked in the one place that they should always feel safe

6188784 8 likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities 9 yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee

6188837 i needed a director who could take a potentially silly premise and make it real for actors and audience without losing the humor and heart of the script
6188838 shaw was the obvious choice to direct this piece and his involvement in the process has been a wish come true and has made this process and this show something very special for all involved

6188841 yo habl con pedja mijatovic y con ram n calder n y me han dicho que robinho se tiene que quedar que no se puede marchar entonces no podemos hacer nada porque tiene dos a os de contrato con el real madrid
6188842 robinho nunca dijo que no disfruta en el madrid pero el hecho es que tiene una oferta econ mica m s interesante es solamente eso
6188843 even within families with the best intentions race can intrude in ugly ways we cant escape this historical legacy that this countrys created
6188844 ich glaube auch nicht dass das in jugoslawien wirklich ein ethnischer konflikt gewesen ist sondern dass die ethnischen differenzen nur von politikern instrumentalisiert worden sind sowohl auf serbischer wie auf kroatischer seite also von milosevic und tudjman
6188845 creo que cada uno a nivel particular debe hacer una autocr tica muy fuerte
6188846 no s lo por el resultado sino por el juego y la imagen lamentable que se dio
6188847 creo que cada uno a nivel particular debe hacer una autocr tica muy fuerte y pensar que lo que hicimos el a o pasado nos cost mucho trabajo y no podemos tirarlo de esa manera
6188848 ya contra el sevilla se vio al equipo muy carente de juego y de chispa ya fuimos inferiores ayer martes ante el valladolid hicimos una primera parte decente pero en la segunda parte cometimos errores que no pueden cometer un equipo de primera divisi n
6188849 si jugamos andando en vez de jugar como el a o pasado no ganaremos a nadie el cansancio es algo normal pero para todos los equipos
6188850 es un gran equipo lo ha demostrado durante a os
6188851 no me conf o pienso que pachuca es un gran equipo lo ha demostrado durante a os lleg a ser el equipo que m s le gustaba a la gente cuando gan la sudamericana cuando fue campe n todo esto no me conf o he visto los partidos de pachuca y ha jugado bastante bien nosotros tenemos que estar atentos
6188852 tal vez por los puntos s estamos mejor pero a la hora del enfrentamiento no cuenta esto no pasa nada tenemos que enfrentar a nuestros rivales con mucho respeto queremos seguir sumando ojal sea de tres ellos tambi n piensan en esto
6188853 incluso el hecho de que pumas no gane en cu a los tuzos desde el torneo invierno 99 sigue siendo eso n meros estad sticas pero lo cierto es que el conjunto del pedregal buscar vencer a los dirigidos por enrique meza
6188854 los n meros son fr os cu ntos partidos tenemos sin ganarles nueve son n meros esperemos que ahora en la oportunidad que se presenta revertir la situaci n as son los n meros muy fr os 1 1 2 no hay vuelta de hoja
6188855 toda derrota causa una molestia una irritaci n y naturalmente que yo creo que los errores que se tienen principalmente a la defensiva causan esta situaci n de que en un partido muy cerrado te anoten un gol se fueron conjuntando desatenciones hasta que cay el gol naturalmente tenemos que sobreponernos a esto volver a tener la tranquilidad trabajar para que esto no suceda
6188856 est la situaci n en fifa ya y estamos esperando de un momento a otro una respuesta

6188864 no por el momento es bastante negativa tenemos que esperar que es lo que dice ma ana rafael ortega la verdad que no hay que anticiparnos a nada pero si por el momento hoy me sacaron dos jeringas de sangre de la rodilla y el doctor gerardo aguilar dice que el pron stico es que puede haber una ruptura parcial del ligamento cruzado
6188865 el doctor es la persona m s indicada para responderte eso lo mejor es que esto no hubiese pasado pero lo mejor ahorita ya es que no entre a cirug a si no entro a cirug a o si la lesi n no requiere cirug a la recuperaci n es m s r pida
6188866 s porque yo quiero vivir esto con veracruz y es un poquito dif cil para m porque quedar afuera as es frustrante y se siente una impotencia muy grande yo s que vamos a lograr grandes cosas y yo voy a estar pronto sea cual sea el resultado yo voy a estar muy pronto y voy a estar aqu para pelear y para hacer y para lograr que veracruz regrese a la primera divisi n no voy a descansar hasta que eso no pase
6188867 por el momento s el doctor dice que al l encontrar tanta sangre en mi rodilla es indicio de que hay una ruptura y de que hay una lesi n entonces el pron stico ahorita es muy negativo
6188868 s ma ana tengo la valoraci n con el doctor rafael ortega y a partir de eso vamos a ver qu es lo que l dice y qu es lo que sucede nosotros tenemos que mantenernos positivos y con fuerzas para creer que las cosas van a salir bien y que bueno en el peor de los casos tendr que hacer una rehabilitaci n muy r pida y muy fuerte y muy buena para estar de regreso

6188876 you do not achieve peace by creating a situation where you can not defend your borders and therefore protect your citizens having a temporary cessation of hostility is not peace if while that cessation of hostility is going on just across the border arms are being built up for the purpose of eventually pushing that border down

6188935 i would already think that just what weve accomplished already theyre pretty happy with what were doing because were playing our hearts out for them you know what i mean when you play your hearts out for someone else and yourself it seems like its a lot but we have a lot to give
6188936 theres a tendency when things are a little bit tight that you want to make a great play
6188937 we dont need great we just need lots and lots of good so we just had to settle down and get back into it
6188938 when you spend a couple of hours trying to contain that and finally get the result you want it kind of explodes a little bit

6188940 since november 2002 apec leaders agreed to take measures to promote secure trade in the region four months later in february 2003 they discussed the fight against terrorism and agreed that apec should intensify efforts in this regard
6188941 this requires a commitment of all shareholders and private and public sector participants
6188942 the public private cooperation should take an active and proactive participation and commitment in this goal and hence the private sector should be seen as a partner and not just as a financing entity for these coordinations

6188978 obviously you have to find a way to bowl some dots against him and build a bit of pressure because he is one of the worlds best if not the best at the moment botha said
6188979 he has got all the shots and new ones i see it as a challenge because no one else out there does it so i would like to see what i do if he does it
6188980 we have had a few chats and some of the senior guys have an idea what i should do
6188981 if he moves late you cannot do anything if the ball has already left your hand
6188982 if he does move early you maybe could pull out but i suppose it is also a good opportunity for a wicket if you get it right
6188983 if he is totally turning around then his head is moving but you have to acknowledge he has done it well so far i have seen him five to 10 times and he has never failed
6188984 the first two games are going to be important botha said

6188988 scientists have been working on the possibilities for decades nanotechnology today is an emerging set of tools techniques and unique applications involving the structure and co mposition of materials on a nanoscale that is billionths of a metre

6188991 many women dont set their sights high enough and need to be convinced they can do something before doing it they are more risk averse
6188992 one piece of research compared 85 women and 255 men at the director or vice president level and found that the only competency on which the women consistently scored lower than men is self esteem
6188993 this is not to say that men dont also suffer from a lack of confidence at times but it is certainly less widespread
6188994 there is no quicker way to lose touch with an organisation than to close your door to write memos and send email
6188995 sometimes we solve problems faster face to face when we dont have to deal with repetitive memos and email
6188996 most projects involved software development which is notorious for coming in late and over budget to solve this problem we developed a standardised deal sheet that had to be completed and approved by the appropriate organisations including finance in advance of contract approval
6188997 this change allowed us to conduct accurate post project audits to ensure the approved roi was actually achieved
6188998 lately some international hotel groups have been trying to regain control over online markets one marketing strategy used by these hotel groups is the introduction of lowest rate guaranteed programmes

6189006 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
6189007 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings
6189008 the incorporation of our nansulate coating into these medical devices represents a brand new market segment opportunity edward moore design is an expert in their field and we look forward to our technology offering unique benefits to their company for this medical equipment and other designs energy savings is something that is important to every industry and we are pleased to offer a solution that can be used in a variety of diverse applications

6189014 these world class scientists will be sharing their recent research results here which our students and lecturers can benefit from this face to face meeting enables us to get the information faster than waiting for their work to be published which may take two or three more years
6189015 the project will infuse nanotechnology into the sri lankan industrial sector and make sri lankan products world leading and competitive nanotechnology can be used to enhance most of the industrials products such as rubber products apparels and energy
6189016 nanotechnology will be critical to solving global problems facing the environment and its inhabitants however the broad scope of the health and safety research as well as the pace at which data are needed to protect human health and the environment exceed current research efforts

6189324 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6189325 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6189326 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6189327 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
6189328 there are drugs on the market for oa treatment but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
6189329 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
6189330 im pretty confident in saying that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health
6189331 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
6189332 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis of this prevalent disease
6189333 we found a different profile of chemicals above tumor sites relative to healthy skin
6189334 the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6189335 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6189336 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6189337 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6189338 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians
6189339 despite media coverage of alcohol related problems at sporting events there has been surprisingly little published research addressing alcohol use sales or problems at professional sport stadiums in the u s
6189340 this is the first study that we know of that looked systematically at the likelihood of illegal alcohol sales at professional sport stadiums across a larger number of stadiums
6189341 alcohol problems at sports stadiums received considerable press attention in the early 1980s as there were several incidents involving violence in the stadiums and drinking driving incidents stemming from intoxicated fans leaving sporting events
6189342 as a result the national highway traffic safety administration developed a responsible beverage service rbs training program for alcohol servers in stadium venues
6189343 many sports stadiums are known to condone alcohol related rowdy behavior that can easily lead to violence as well as a likely location to begin drinking driving incidents
6189344 nearly one out of five youth who appeared under age 21 could purchase alcohol without age identification at the 16 professional hockey football basketball and baseball stadiums in the u s that we assessed
6189345 approximately three out of four fans who appeared obviously intoxicated could easily purchase alcohol at these professional sporting events what this indicates to me is that we have had some success in emphasizing the importance of not selling alcohol to underage people the likelihood of alcohol establishments selling alcohol to underage youth was 50 to 99 percent across communities during the early 1990s however we still need to get the likelihood of sales to underage youth even lower across all venues and we have significantly more work to do to address sales to obviously intoxicated patrons
6189346 a 74 percent violation rate is simply unacceptable and demonstrates that even basic steps to insure compliance with the law are not being taken second the study confirms what prevention specialists have long suspected that alcohol sales in the stands as opposed to the concessions create high risk for illegal sales
6189347 one reason may be that when alcohol is sold in the stands it may be more difficult for the servers to hear or to see the customer to assess their age and level of intoxication
6189348 the servers may feel pressure to make the sale quickly in the stands to get to all of the customers and to get out of the way of fans who are trying to watch the game giving the server less time to do the proper assessment also we have found that alcohol sales are less likely when managers are present the servers in the stands may feel that they are not being watched as closely by managers compared to the servers located in the booths
6189349 we have found here in california that banning alcohol at beaches has had very positive effects not only in terms of reducing alcohol related violence and rowdiness at the beaches but also for local businesses that initially opposed the bans
6189350 instead of reducing the number of beachgoers as was feared it actually increased use of the beaches and increased sales in nearby businesses with the reduction in intoxicated beachgoers people put off by the disruption started coming in greater numbers particularly families i believe the same phenomenon will occur at sports stadiums
6189351 illegal alcohol sales affect more people than just those who are served the alcohol
6189352 as youth and adults become more intoxicated they may cause disruptions get into arguments or injure other fans attending the games after leaving the events they may damage property surrounding the stadiums or get behind the wheel and crash into other fans or individuals in the community this really is a larger problem that needs to be addressed by every community that houses a professional sport stadium
6189353 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
6189354 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
6189355 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
6189356 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
6189357 given the results of this study stadium management and local and state elected officials may want to consider banning or restricting alcohol sales in the stands at sporting events as some stadiums have already done
6189358 however if such a policy is not politically feasible in a particular stadium vendors in the stands may need to receive additional training regarding responsible service of alcohol training that could include how to check age identification and more clearly recognize signs of obvious intoxication
6189359 in addition law enforcement and community groups need to actively monitor and work with stadiums to promote responsible alcohol service at these events

6189366 the coach was coming from the driveway down into the garden and turning onto its side and then crash landing into the garden
6189367 you just dont expect the coach to land in the garden
6189368 there was lots of screaming and shouting and crying and lots of blood
6189369 as soon as the coach had landed i had got on the phone to 999 and got my son to grab loads of towels
6189370 then after i finished on the phone i just told him to go and watch cartoons and close the curtains and then i came outside and helped out the best i could

6189381 the key phrase used twice in the times story is all but and it provides obamas advisers the vast wiggle room in which they can simultaneously assert that he has made up his mind and that he hasnt made up his mind in other words the times has no news to report only a higher octane of speculation it expects its readers to swallow until obama does make his announcement

6189400 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent
6189401 your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6189402 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6189403 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6189404 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries
6189405 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6189406 obviously what we had wasnt working might as well try something else

6189410 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly
6189411 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul

6189422 a precursor to the sims which i love and secretly play now in oregon trail you had control over the characters on the occasion of a particularly bad day i would run down to the lab and load up my wagon with people that had pissed me off and purposely lose the game oh no lil billy has two broken limbs and was carried away by indians oh no poor sarah died of dysentery but thats not the end to my evil ways it got better after poor billy or sarah bit the dust you are asked to write a dear sweet epitaph on you fellow wagoneers tombstone and when the game asked are you sure you want to forge the river i always replied yes i was

6189426 the illinois senator mentions his brother in his autobiography describing him in just one passing paragraph as a
6189427 you can choose your friends but you cant choose your family
6189428 the producers wanted to connect the stories a little more so i added a connective tissue but very little
6189429 as little as possible because i didnt want to interfere with the original scripts which were all great
6189430 i thought it would be nice to see a prism of peoples views on batman or each writers particular take on batman so i didnt want to insert myself and i didnt
6189431 i actually liked the idea of doing stories without the connective tissue i liked the idea of doing six different batmans and seeing what everybody came up with i like shorts that stand on their own
6189432 whats really fun is deadshot is very much a loner
6189433 he works by himself and talks to himself and he kills from a distance i think he takes great pride in what he does because he does it so well hes a pretty vicious character but in some ways hes a bit of a coward because hes killing from a distance
6189434 its got a lot of eye candy and all six stories are very different they all have different palettes and a different use of lines that being said they all work extremely well together
6189435 the producers gave me an overview and i sat down and hammered at it and turned in a script
6189436 they said they liked it and then i went away you write something for animation and once you script it at least this is how i was involved in it you have no input and no say it goes off to japan and they hand it to the director of the animation studio and these guys make of it what they will i got to see it a little while ago and its not what i pictured in my mind at every turn but you know its very hard for me to judge because you try not to come to these things with preconceived notions but a lot of what i was after got there
6189437 kevin conroy is doing the voice of batman and thats just so cool
6189438 conroys batman is perfect and i love the alan burnett paul dini and bruce timm animated batman im working on a thing where alan burnett is on it and bruce timm is on it holy mackerel its that same thrill i got the first time i read a comic and all of sudden there was an artist and he drew batman and batman was saying the stuff i wrote now there are a bunch of guys who animated this thing and kevin conroy is saying the stuff that i wrote wow its really hard to look at any part of that gift horse and any part of its anatomy and not be happy
6189439 i got no complaints trust me i am very happy im just hoping hes doesnt wind up dead in anything
6189440 here was a young man who had killed himself remarkably to deliver a message to a woman he wanted to remember him no doubt she does i certainly do but the message itself seemed inconsequential purposefully vague did he want to be dead forever or only absent from the pain i wanted to die is all it seemed to say clearly oh is what the rest of us say
6189441 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of
6189442 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6189443 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6189444 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6189445 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6189446 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6189447 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6189448 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6189449 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6189450 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities
6189451 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

6189463 i set myself on fire and people come to watch me burn
6189464 the dignitaries on the platform cringed and shrank away like troops before a strafing attack

6189469 norway has noted that russia has decided for the time being to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6189470 nato has not received any notification from the russians saying they are going to cut military cooperation activities
6189471 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6189472 military naval exercises in the far east the mediterranean in the baltic
6189473 this is not going to happen if afghanistan is the new vietnam for the americans then it will be a problem for russia itself we are not interested in the alliances failure in afghanistan
6189474 we wish to continue the cooperation with russia as far as possible but now the conflict with russia has escalated further its a quite demanding security policy landscape thats developing

6189476 saying that one neighborhood has 300 burglaries and another 400 when one has twice the population of the other does not present a fair comparison it creates prejudices against neighborhoods which already suffer from bad reputations and more importantly against poor persons who live in those neighborhoods

6189482 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6189483 of course a draw with one of the worlds best football teams is a positive result but theres no reason for euphoria its only a draw we still need to work hard to achieve something serious
6189484 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6189485 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6189486 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience

6189490 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain
6189491 as far as were concerned shes still here until further notice and until the lord says its her time to go
6189492 with this acquisition we have considerably strengthened our position in the maritimes
6189493 since 1989 alans diverse background as an insurance broker claims adjuster and independent adjuster arms him with the common sense and skills necessary to ensure good communications between insurers insureds and everyone in between in the related service industry
6189494 he had a pretty strong race in the jim dandy
6189495 and trying to get two good races out of a horse here can be pretty tricky
6189496 he has gotten bigger and stronger as a three year old the biggest change in him is that hes become much more of a work horse hes a good looking horse i dont think weve seen the full potential of him yet the travers will be interesting
6189497 he beat him convincingly going a mile i think that race stamped his quality because of j be ks accomplishments he won the woody stephens at belmont park i think the interesting thing about the travers will be the 1 1 4 miles he has never gone that far but he did run well at a 1 3 16 miles and he acted like he had more to give that day

6189499 its not just the housing picture that one has to fathom but its also public policy what is the government going to do
6189500 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6189501 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6189502 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6189503 what may be safe for many may be life threatening for a few
6189504 they should talk to their physicians about this for sure i think thats the most immediate advice talk about other alternatives or whether you need such a high dose or what to do
6189505 if you feel groggy and sedated you have to assume the baby is experiencing the same
6189506 we realize that codeine is very useful for many women the point here is to be much more sensitive and not assume that it is safe
6189507 i think now that this is out there we need to
6189508 com pen di um a simple collection of many thoughts
6189509 the power of the word is what makes anything possible
6189510 simply know how to express your idea or concept in words and you create something new and wonderful
6189511 if you can imagine it you can achieve it if you can dream it you can become it
6189512 i want to see those excess dollars spent on patient care
6189513 i wouldnt be surprised if you show up here next year with a 70 million positive bottom line
6189514 we dont intend to come to you next year with our tail between our legs with all this money we are hiding
6189515 weve got projects that need funding we dont want to overextend or undershoot
6189516 i think its prudent we maintain a positive financial position
6189517 if we are putting dollars into improving access for our patients then we are fulfilling our mission
6189518 we want to get another years worth of data to help demonstrate the value of the demonstration protocols for possible use on a broader scale
6189519 out of this hopefully were going to have some real changes in how medicare pays
6189520 id like to have them say weve pretty much proven if you follow heart failure patients with this method it saves lives and saves money

6189542 i dont know that were ever going to figure out what the source was but we might
6189543 some of the practices that we know have gone on at the affected property really would be prime to transmit the organism
6189544 certainly theyre going to be in long term quarantine depending on what the owner elects to do
6189545 euthanasias an option i dont think at this point were going to require that but treatment is difficult its expensive and it can be hard on the horse and theres no guarantee that it would even work im not sure what the owners going to elect to do but no matter what its certainly going to be a long term quarantine
6189546 were going to really do a thorough job of tick trappings and tick drags and tick checks
6189547 weve asked practitioners to report any clinical signs and to submit any ticks they find on horses itll be interesting to see what we get here in the next few weeks
6189548 the positive news out of this is that so far we havent found any exotic ticks or any ticks known to transmit the disease
6189549 so far theres only one premises with positives or clinical signs
6189550 he gave up a very nice job in korea to come here for us mainly for our education
6189551 we drove the back alleys of chicago and picked up couches people threw away
6189552 the mattress i remember smelling that thing and my mom cleaning it taking it outside banging the dust off it was horrible thats how we started our lives
6189553 i said actually i dont have anything to pay back because its not a loan its grants and scholarship he goes no son of mine is gonna mooch off the government you pay back somehow so i signed up with the illinois national guard my dad was really happy my mother on the other hand goes we left korea so we dont have to do mandatory military service and here you go and volunteer for military what is wrong with you guys so thats how my military career started
6189554 after september 11 my brother actually was the impetus for me to join back up
6189555 i remember being scared but also excited that i was going to participate in something i felt very strongly about that we would go over there as a medical company and kind of save the world
6189556 im a rehab physician so i deal with secondary issues of an injury
6189557 but over there trauma medicine we were really into it it gets the adrenaline going
6189558 because to me i was meeting the adolf hitler of my day he had that aura about him that he thought he was still in charge like at some point he would be back out and maybe leading his people again
6189559 i took care of chemical ali tariq aziz saddams half brother was there
6189560 they were cordial but had an air of entitlement about them i actually had tea with them on occasion through the course of doing my rounds camp cropper was kind of like being at a nursing home for the rich and infamous
6189561 i found him to be very professional it was almost like wow youre the person who was such a tyrant he spoke english very well and i think he understood more than he let on the same with the others they thought we had the power to let them out they were offering us all kinds of things i have money stashed here if you let me out ill give you this cash it was hilarious they were very crafty very smart people i think they used it in the wrong way
6189562 we downloaded all the regulations and revamped the prisoner care system
6189563 we werent far from baghdad and you could see smoke billowing in multiple places
6189564 for anybody who has ever seen the movie saving private ryan the beach scene when the bomb goes off next to him and everythings muffled it was 1 million percent exactly like that
6189565 he was just splattered with blood and white as a ghost
6189566 he looked at me and said cookie you look pretty fucked up and im like can you help me and he said i cant move he was just frozen
6189567 but the tech they had doing it was really nervous being a nurse for 17 years i remember helping him do it i was in so much pain it didnt matter
6189568 you know how people say my life flashed in front of me oh my god how true that was
6189569 as soon as i saw the orange flash my thoughts were oh shoot here it goes
6189570 when i woke up a medic was working on me and all i remember was the pain i touched a part of my head and i saw a lot of blood all i know is being very scared
6189571 getting further away from my unit i knew the chance of getting back was less and less when i got to germany i fought with that surgeon too it was very depressing to accept i wanted to go back to iraq so bad to my soldiers
6189572 youre deployed and you think about going over there and doing a good job or you think about getting killed you dont think about what it would be like if you didnt die you never think about getting wounded
6189573 i was seen by a trauma surgeon and an orthopedic surgeon every day
6189574 and then about a week into my stay they had a psychiatrist come around and do a mental health evaluation i was obviously a candidate for post traumatic stress
6189575 with percocet you can take two pills every four to six hours
6189576 and i watched the clock i tried desperately not to allow the pain to spike i probably took those pain pills eight or nine months there definitely was an addiction
6189577 they had to bring me a urinal and they had to dump the urinal out they had to help me onto the toilet they had to wipe my backside they had to get me into the bathtub they had to help me fix my pillow when i rolled over at night help me get out of bed and back into the wheelchair i was almost like an infant in an adult body
6189578 whether it was conscious or subconscious i made an effort that if i was gonna feel like shit everybody else was gonna feel like shit too
6189579 pulling the trigger was the easiest part of that whole day
6189580 i dont have any remorse for that but i felt guilty for living because of the sheer violence of the explosion the amount of damage that occurred all around me i shouldve died i couldnt process why i lived
6189581 i envisioned shooting myself in the head in the wheelchair
6189582 i could even tell you which gun cause i had it all planned out
6189583 when i found out about it i blew a gasket because it screwed up my plan when the guns were gone it kind of deflated me
6189584 am i going to stay this way or am i going to wake up
6189585 if the brain injury is severe its pretty obvious youve got a big gash and youre not talking right but if i get angry is it a brain injury component or is it ptsd you have to treat both in a sense
6189586 it didnt feel right to go talk to somebody about these issues and i really thought i had no problems
6189587 but for about two years my colleagues were telling me ken somethings not right
6189588 i was drinking a lot before one beer and i couldnt handle it i rarely drank but now taking six seven eight cocktails wasnt an issue
6189589 i was always mad at my kids and my wife to the point where my son was afraid when he dropped something on the floor i would look and he would cringe every time i got mad i would grab a toy and then out the window you pissed me off this toys gone pretty soon there were no toys left
6189590 my daughter said to me daddy you dont smile anymore thats when it really hit me i was not the father she remembered so i sought help there were two psychiatrists from the medical college who really helped me
6189591 my wife continued to have issues until and i had never heard this before she brought up the word divorce that really scared me then i realized an entire person in me changed i was not ken lee anymore
6189592 she really got the rotten end of the whole deal
6189593 my dad basically took the pills away from me and i had no choice but to stop taking them
6189594 i was like an addict physically withdrawing body sweats constantly shaking
6189595 when i first was having the night terrors i was living that movie now when i think about it and dream about it i see myself watching it so i dont necessarily put myself in the position of the guy that got blown up
6189596 once you have the diagnosis i think you always have it
6189597 i have a little bit more of a chicken little the sky is falling attitude
6189598 i see the picture and i was there but i cannot remember that we were there it absolutely drives me nuts little pieces are gone
6189599 but im no longer afraid of that im very functional very capable ive learned to move on and when the symptoms come back ill deal with it again ptsd has a trigger and youve got to identify that trigger and learn how to cope with it bring your blood pressure down calm yourself down tell yourself its not a potential bomb on the road its just a garbage bag
6189600 i gave 14 and a half years to the military and then all of a sudden im no good to them i got visits from the vfw and the american legion and that was it anything i needed from the state national guard i had to call for
6189601 i felt like i was useful to them when i was a soldier who had four good appendages
6189602 but then when youre wounded and youre basically bedridden i felt as though i was not needed anymore
6189603 the va was all over me when i came back
6189604 there was help available but i just didnt want it i refused to listen
6189605 you left this family here at home to join a new family
6189606 but you left that new family a little earlier than you should
6189607 his dad actually thanked me for saving his sons life
6189608 man he was mad at me so was every soldier i know the commanders job is a lonely job but the fact is chris almost lost his leg he loves being in the military but now he cant anymore every time i see chris i feel guilty i caused that
6189609 he said to me you know i have to live with the decisions i make i think about the decision i made all the time and i never thought about that from a commanders perspective i only looked at it from my perspective and at that point it made him human
6189610 you have to be able to forget i shouldnt say that you never forget but you learn how to forgive ive come to realize that ken lee has his own demons to deal with just like i do
6189611 its kind of a way of working on the battlefront at home
6189612 pulling out would be seen as a sign of weakness and then our country would become targets of opportunity on our own soil
6189613 even though im officially retired ill always be a member of the army i still look at it as an absolute obligation and a pleasure that i was able to serve id do it again i have no regrets other than the fact that i couldnt stay in
6189614 i try to cope with it the best i can with my kids letting them know that life goes on
6189615 my thumbs are a problem a lot of times i cant turn a doorknob or turn keys in the car so my kids turn the key for me
6189616 and if i get the call ive got to go my wife says shell call the general and make a big stink but you know i cant stay in the guard and then when my time comes up again not go i think thats wrong
6189617 one thing i wont give up is my military life
6189618 if theres a challenge between my family and the military i tend to take the military
6189619 military life is easier it is very structured you get up you got things to do you just follow your structured life every day once you come home youve got a whole slew of things to deal with life is a lot more hectic
6189620 over there all youve got to worry about is am i gonna get killed today or maimed today but thats a fact of life in a war zone so you accept it
6189621 i dont think therell be any problem for me to be out there again
6189622 i would attribute our growth to clients being unhappy in terms of the broker theyre dealing with
6189623 maybe they were invested too aggressively or theyre not getting the level of service they want and there is turnover
6189624 they will be making more profits so who cares what ones profit margin percentage is
6189625 suddenly you have all this new money and you become slightly understaffed so you go out and hire people and during the year you do the hiring your margins usually drop a little bit
6189626 importante assinalar que tal situa o contrasta com o que ocorre nas esferas federal e estadual os crimes de responsabilidade de ministros e de secret rios de estado j s o previstos por lei
6189627 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
6189628 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
6189629 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
6189630 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
6189631 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
6189632 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6189633 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
6189634 this was a systems problem that resulted in something we call a near miss
6189635 the baby is completely normal but it was a serious thing
6189636 we responded to this allegation by engaging law enforcement and swiftly implementing corrective actions including distribution of an in depth patient care policy as well as staff training and education
6189637 moreover the employee in question was cleared of all charges and our corrective actions were accepted by the state public health department
6189638 i cannot stop one human being even a presidential candidate from admiring the courage and sacrifice of peaceful protesters on the edmund pettus bridge or making comments about it
6189639 sen mccain and i are colleagues in the us congress not confidantes he does not consult me and i do not consult him
6189640 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
6189641 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response

6189647 i would view the power i would inherit from president bush as a ceiling not a floor

6189654 merial is excited to be a corporate sponsor of the 2008 world rabies day and is proud to offer experience and expertise as a world leader in rabies prevention
6189655 we want to help protect horses livestock and their owners from the devastating effects of rabies by providing educational materials prevention tips and information about rabies to veterinarians and their clients
6189656 what may be safe for many may be life threatening for a few
6189657 they should talk to their physicians about this for sure i think thats the most immediate advice talk about other alternatives or whether you need such a high dose or what to do
6189658 if you feel groggy and sedated you have to assume the baby is experiencing the same
6189659 we realize that codeine is very useful for many women the point here is to be much more sensitive and not assume that it is safe
6189660 i think now that this is out there we need to
6189661 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6189662 he is great too great hes strong character can make the world go round
6189663 i am small too small tired and can not walk without my stick as see i am sitting down here under the shade of this old oak and can not look high up to the sky i am staring at the ground watching the ants carrying twice as big things as their bodies

6189665 oh im not pregnant i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch

6189902 all h hat f r die menschen die ihn lieben zwei zeichen gegeben das befolgen des propheten frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn und dem dschihad f r all hs sache und das ist weil der dschihad in wirklichkeit eine bem hung f r das ist was all h liebt wie der imaan glauben und die guten taten und das zur ckweisen was ihn z rnt wie den unglauben und bel und ungehorsam
6189903 handle du darum aufrichtig wie dir befohlen worden ist und die sich mit dir bekehrt haben und seid nicht aufs ssig wahrlich er ist dessen ansichtig was ihr tut
6189904 und folge dem was dir offenbart wurde und sei geduldig bis all h richtet denn er ist der beste richter
6189905 und du sollst zwischen ihnen nach dem richten was von all h herabgesandt wurde und folge nicht ihren neigungen und sei vor ihnen auf der hut damit sie dich nicht bedr ngen und von einem teil dessen was all h zu dir herabgesandt hat wegtreiben
6189906 also halte denn an dem fest was dir offenbart worden ist denn du bist auf dem geraden weg
6189907 folgt dem was zu euch von eurem herrn herabgesandt wurde und folgt keinen anderen awliya besch tzern au er ihm wie wenig seid ihr dessen eingedenk
6189908 und dies ist mein gerader weg so folgt ihm und folgt nicht den verschiedenen wegen damit sie euch nicht weitab von seinem weg f hren
6189909 wer in unserer angelegenheit religion etwas erneuert was nicht dazugeh rt so ist es zur ckgewiesen
6189910 wer von euch leben wird der wird viele uneinigkeiten sehen deswegen haltet an meiner sunna tradition fest und an der sunna der rechtgeleiteten kalifen nach mir bei t an ihr mit eurem backenzahn fest und gibt acht vor den erneuerungen in den angelegenheiten religion denn jede erneuerung ist eine irreleitung
6189911 die entscheidung liegt einzig bei all h er hat geboten ihn allein zu dienen das ist der richtige glaube
6189912 und ber was immer ihr uneins seid die entscheidung dar ber ruht bei all h
6189913 w nschen sie etwa das urteil der ghahiliya ignoranz und wer ist ein besserer richter als all h f r ein volk das fest im glauben ist
6189914 soll ich denn einen anderen richter suchen als all h und er ist es der euch das buch klar gemacht und herabgesandt hat
6189915 oder haben sie etwa partner die ihnen eine glaubenslehre vorgeschrieben haben die all h nicht verordnet hat
6189916 und du sollst zwischen ihnen nach dem richten was von all h herabgesandt wurde und folge nicht ihren neigungen und sei vor ihnen auf der hut damit sie dich nicht bedr ngen und von einem teil dessen was all h zu dir herabgesandt hat wegtreiben
6189917 sie haben sich ihre schriftgelehrten und m nche zu herren genommen au er all h
6189918 wir dienen sie nicht in sachen der opferung und in der anrufung und niederwerfung und niederknien
6189919 verbieten sie euch denn nicht das was all h erlaubt hat und ihr erkl rt es somit f r verboten und erlauben sie euch nicht das was all h verboten hat und ihr erkl rt es somit f r erlaubt
6189920 wahrlich die menschen in allen systemen auf der ganzen welt nehmen sich gegenseitig zu herren neben all h und das geschieht sowohl in den h chsten stufen der demokratien als auch in den niedrigsten stufen der diktaturen
6189921 die offensichtlichste und einzigartigste g ttliche eigenschaft in bezug auf die gesch pfe ist die unterwerfung der diener und das erlassen von gesetzen f r ihr leben und das aufstellen von waagen f r sie wer also etwas davon sich zuschreibt der hat sich damit die einzigartigste g ttliche eigenschaft zugeschrieben und er hat sich dadurch zu einem gott neben all h gemacht
6189922 wahrlich derjenige der das recht hat etwas f r erlaubt und verboten zu erkl ren ist all h allein und sonst f r keinen unter den menschen weder f r einen individum noch f r einen level und auch nicht f r eine nation oder f r die menscheit insgesamt au er mit der erlaubnis all hs und im einklang mit den gesetzen all hs
6189923 und ber was immer ihr uneins seid die entscheidung dar ber ruht bei all h
6189924 o ihr die ihr glaubt gehorcht all h und gehorcht dem gesandten und denen die unter euch befehlsgewalt besitzen und wenn ihr ber etwas streitet so bringt es vor all h und den gesandten wenn ihr an all h glaubt und an den j ngsten tag
6189925 dieses zur ckverweisen wurde zu einer notwendigkeit und verpflichtung f r den iman glauben gemacht wenn dieses zur ckverweisen nun ausbleibt so ist auch der iman glaube ausgeblieben da das ausbleiben dieser verpflichtung zu dem ausbleiben des anderen f hrt
6189926 hast du nicht jene gesehen die behaupteten an das zu glauben was zu dir und was vor dir hinabgesandt worden ist sie wollen eine rechtswirksame entscheidung beim taghut falsche g tter suchen wo ihnen doch befohlen worden ist nicht daran zu glauben
6189927 all h liebt nicht dass b se worte laut vernehmbar gebraucht werden au er wenn einem unrecht geschieht
6189928 und wenn du sie fragst so werden sie gewiss sagen
6189929 galt euer spott etwa all h und seinen zeichen und seinem gesandten
6189930 was f r all h ist ist f r all h
6189931 glaubt ihr denn an einen teil des buches und leugnet einen anderen teil f r diejenigen unter euch die solches tun gibt es aber keine andere vergeltung au er schande in diesem leben und am tage der auferstehung werden sie der strengsten bestrafung zugef hrt werden
6189932 und k mpft gegen sie bis es keine fitna polytheismus mehr gibt und bis die religion komplett all hs ist
6189933 jede gruppe die sich weigert an einer regel der regeln des islams die klar und g ltig sind festzuhalten muss bek mpft werden bis die religion komplett all hs ist und das ist der konsensus der gelehrten
6189934 und er hat euch schon in dem buch herabgesandt dass wenn ihr h rt dass die zeichen all hs geleugnet und verspottet werden ihr nicht bei ihnen sitzt bis sie zu einem anderen gespr ch bergehen ihr w ret sonst wie sie wahrlich all h wird die heuchler und die ungl ubigen allesamt in ghahannam h lle versammeln
6189935 und die meisten von ihnen glauben nicht an all h ohne ihm g tter zur seite zu stellen
6189936 und wenn du den meisten derer auf der erde gehorchst werden sie dich von all hs weg irref hren sie folgen nur vermutungen und sie raten nur
6189937 die mehrheit der gemeinschaft haben die gemeinschaft verlassen und die gemeinschaft ist auf der wahrheit selbst wenn du alleine bist
6189938 die ahlu sunnah waren die minderheit in der vergangenen zeit und sie sind die minderheit in der heutigen zeit sie geh ren zu denen die nicht mit den reichen mit ihrem reichtum gingen noch mit den leuten der erneuerung im glauben mit ihren erneuerungen und sie blieben standhaft auf ihrer sunna bis sie auf ihren herr trafen so seid wie sie
6189939 ich diene nicht dem dem ihr dient und ihr dient nicht dem dem ich diene
6189940 alle berreste der verschwundenen ba th partei zu beseitigen und den zerst renden ein ende zu bereiten wie den selbstm rdern saddams und den terroristen
6189941 es ist nicht erlaubt auf einen boden zu sitzen wo abu bakr und umar verflucht werden
