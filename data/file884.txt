8840000 ich hoffe dass dann in einer woche alle formalit ten erledigt sind und die kinder wieder zur ck k nnen
8840001 vor vier jahren stand ich vor euch und habe euch meine geschichte erz hlt von der kurzen verbindung zwischen einem jungen mann aus kenia und einer jungen frau aus kansas die nicht wohlhabend oder bekannt waren aber den glauben teilten dass ihr sohn in amerika alles erreichen kann was immer er auch vorhat
8840002 the last time we came here for some reason i played a weakened team
8840003 we had a lot of reserves in our line up as we had a game against newcastle on the following monday
8840004 when i saw lazio celebrating as if they had won the world cup i thought that wont happen again i will play a much stronger team this time and although there will be some changes we will represent the club in the right way
8840005 he is not just the top manager in europe he is the top of the world
8840006 you cannot work at that level for 22 years at a club like manchester united with all the pressures that they bring without having an exceptional quality and ferguson has that
8840007 global trends show that food prices will decline next year leaving south africas farmers little room to pass on increased costs to the consumer said abdolreza abbassian secretary of the intergovernmental group on grains trade and markets division at the food and agriculture organisation fao in rome
8840008 mulu calculated that she could afford to care for one more child back in addis ababa but which to choose
8840009 they were all so skinny they were all the same
8840010 in the united states as much as 30 percent of food products worth some 48 3 billion dollars is thrown away annually just by households alone
8840011 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
8840012 this month an indian official said eating rats was a way to beat rising global food prices
8840013 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
8840014 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
8840015 you know whats great about what i do you dont have to be against anybody just for whoever you think should be the next president
8840016 im not here to speak against mccain but tell you why i support barak obama as the next presidents of the united states

8840024 gli usa hanno orchestrato la guerra in georgia hanno spinto il paese ad attaccare lossezia del sud
8840025 di incrementare al pi presto la qualit dei loro prodotti altrimenti andranno incontro allo stesso provvedimento
8840026 la russia non ha avuto altra scelta che invadere la georgia dopo che alcuni peacekeepers erano stati uccisi in ossezia del sud
8840027 deluso dal fatto che gli stati uniti non abbiano fatto di pi per fermare lattacco georgiano
8840028 il fatto ha aggiunto putin alla cnn che cittadini americani si trovavano nella zona del conflitto durante le ostilit
8840029 bisogna ammettere ha proseguito che avrebbero fatto questo solo sotto il diretto comando dei loro leader
8840030 orchestrato il conflito in georgia a beneficio di uno dei candidati alla casa bianca
8840031 eh ini dah teruk aliya kena rujuk ke doktor pakar di hospital kalau tidak keadaan kesihatan awak akan semakin buruk nanti saya tulis reference letter
8840032 awak ada fibroid yang agak besar yang menyebabkan awak menjadi anaemic kalau tak bedah ia akan membesar dan menganggu kehidupan awak
8840033 tapi saya tak rasa sakit pun doktor hanya lemah badan kerana itulah
8840034 awak bernasib baik kerana kedudukannya yang strategik itu tidak memberi kesakitan
8840035 sementara menunggu tarikh pembedahan saya akan beri awak 3 dos ubat untuk menahannya dari terus membesar mungkin boleh mengecutkannya supaya lebih mudah dibedah nanti
8840036 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8840037 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8840038 at this point the future is so cloudy in terms of the development of the market when its going to pick up again
8840039 then i see a very good opportunity that basically i would hope that everything could be break even to profitable
8840040 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8840041 we are selling every hhr and cobalt we can make with either minimal or zero incentives whereas three years ago even the hhr you had to put 3 000 bucks on it to move it so i think in practice the price of small cars has gone up three or four thousand dollars
8840042 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8840043 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8840044 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8840045 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8840046 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission
8840047 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8840048 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8840049 john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8840050 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8840051 to see him as an african american standing in front of this crowd it means that anybody can do anything
8840052 it helped define who we are and what we stand for who our candidate is and what the last eight years have been like
8840053 theres a perception that democrats dont care about the military and are weak on defence and i think weve definitely helped with that
8840054 what the other party has done to us over the last two terms is reason enough
8840055 i think a lot of people had their minds made up this week
8840056 hasta el ltimo de nuestros conflictos mundiales los estados unidos no ten an industria armament stica los fabricantes norteamericanos de arados pod an con tiempo y seg n necesidad fabricar tambi n espadas pero ahora ya no nos podemos arriesgar a una improvisaci n de emergencia de la defensa nacional nos hemos visto obligados a crear una industria de armamentos permanente de grandes proporciones a adido a esto tres millones y medio de hombres y mujeres est n directamente implicados en el sistema de defensa gastamos anualmente en seguridad militar m s que los ingresos netos de todas las empresas de estados unidos esta conjunci n de un inmenso sistema miltar y una gran industria armament stica es algo nuevo para la experiencia norteamericana su influencia total econ mica pol

estar bien seguros de que comprendemos sus graves consecuencias nuestros esfuerzos nuestros recursos y nuestros trabajos est n implicados en ella tambi n la estructura misma de nuestra sociedad en los consejos de gobierno debemos estar alerta contra el desarrollo de influencias indebidas sean buscadas o no del complejo militar industrial existe y existir n circunstancias que har n posible que surjan poderes en lugares indebidos con efectos desastrosos nunca debemos permitir que el peso de esta combinaci n ponga en peligro nuestras libertades ni nuestros procesos democr ticos no deber amos dar nada por supuesto s lo una ciudadan a entendida y alerta puede obligar a que se produzca una correcta imbricaci n entre la inmensa maquinaria defensiva industrial y militar y nuestros m todos y objetivos pac ficos de modo que la seguridad y la libertad puedan prosperar juntas similar y en gran medida responsable por los profundos cambios de nuestra situaci n industrial y militar ha sido la revoluci n tecnol gica durante las d cadas recientes en esta revoluci n la investigaci n ha tenido un papel central tambi n se vuelve m s formalizada compleja y cara una proporci n creciente de la misma se lleva a cabo bajo la direcci n o para los fines del gobierno federal hoy el inventor solitario trasteando en su taller ha sido desplazado por ej rcitos de cientr ficos en laboratorios y campos de pruebas de la misma manera la universidad libre la fuente hist rica de las ideas libres y del descubrimiento cient fico ha experimentado una revoluci n en la manera de llevar a cabo la investigaci n en parte por las enormes cantidades que conlleva un contrato con el gobierno se vuelve virtualmente el sustituto de la curiosidad intelectual por cada antigua pizarra hay ahora cientos de nuevos ordenadores electr nicos la perspectiva de que los acad micos de la nacion puedan llegar a estar dominados por el gobierno federal por la concesi n de proyectos y por el poder del dinero est m s que nunca ante nosotros y es un riesgo que debe considerarse muy seriamente aun teniendo el respeto debido a la investigaci n y los descubrimientos cient ficos tambi n debemos estar alerta ante el peligro contrario e igualmente serio de que la pol tica que ha de velar por el inter s p blico se vuelva cautiva de una lite cient fico tecnol gica es tarea de los hombres de estado dar forma equilibrar e integrar a estas y otras fuerzas nuevas y viejas en el seno de los principios de nuestro sistema democr tico persiguiendo siempre los fines supremos de nuestra sociedad libre v otro factor en el mantenimiento del equilibrio tiene que ver con el factor tiempo al atisbar el futuro de nuestra sociedad debemos vosotros y yo y nuestro gobierno evitar la tendencia a vivir nicamente

protegidos como estamos por nuestra fuerza moral econ mica y militar esa mesa aunque marcada por las cicatrices de muchas frustraciones pasadas no puede abandonarse en favor de la agon a segura del campo de batalla el desarme con honor y confianza mutuos sigue siendo un imperativo juntos debemos aprender c mo solucionar nuestras diferencias no con las armas sino con el intelecto y las

que ha sido testigo del horror y la tristeza que deja la guerra como alguien que sabe que otra guerra podr a destruir totalmente esta civilizaci n que se ha construido tan lentamente y con tantos

8840076 we feel like the first step in trying to get our starters into the mind set that they can throw more pitches and pitch more innings is that they have to get the foundation of conditioning with them
8840077 i dont think you come in and ask them to extend themselves of what theyre accustomed to doing without starting there
8840078 establishment and development of new container terminals at the harbours of burgas and varna
8840079 as were beginning to move forward in recruiting were beginning to build classes
8840080 were stronger at every position from offensive line to defensive line to quarterbacks
8840081 were not throwing people in there just because we have to
8840082 the exciting part of the new offense is that it gives you more freedom to do what you see
8840083 well throw the ball more and well still have the no 1 running back in the meac
8840084 weve got to go out there and get it done

8840100 the difference between this show and the previous ones is that now obama is in the mix
8840101 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8840102 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8840103 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8840104 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8840105 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8840106 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8840107 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8840108 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8840109 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8840110 my son took a web class in school he can do it
8840111 it would be no problem at all said fiszman the clubs second largest shareholder
8840112 its not our decision who he spends money on nor will it ever be our decision
8840113 theres a dual problem for him if we were to buy star names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way arsene plays they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters whove been brought through
8840114 there were great expectations and hopes that we would buy heavily this summer added fiszman
8840115 weve bought well if arsene could find the right player he would buy that player but at the moment he hasnt theres still a little bit of time
8840116 there is this constant thing that the emirates is bleeding the club that weve got these repayments its total crap stressed fiszman
8840117 look at our accounts and you will see our net payments are 20m and the revenue increase from the new stadium is close to 50m
8840118 he doesnt call me and tell me anything said fiszman
8840119 could he buy more well theres not too many shares available it doesnt matter that much to us what he does we have the lock down agreement till 2012 with breaks theres stability in the club we dont believe we need extra investment from him or anywhere else
8840120 im deeply disappointed that this very small family of football and in the premier league we are 20 clubs who rely totally on each other within europe there are 10 clubs going for top players is unable to live and run our businesses decently and properly
8840121 guardate che luca ha bisogno di soldi posso metterli anche io
8840122 pode se ainda recorrer pol cia se um fumante n o quiser apagar o cigarro e tiver de ser retirado do estabelecimento

8840125 a proibi o limita as possibilidades que a pessoa tem para fumar

8840127 fumar n o afeta a moral afeta a sa de
8840128 nunca se recuper despu s de ese hecho andaba derrotado deca do con fiebre
8840129 naturally we can play much better and our aim now is to get into the group stage
8840130 my worst enemy has been myself i can see that my perspective right now i can look back and see clearly that i was sabotaging myself
8840131 that was fear i had some issues that plagued me which resulted in always questioning and questioning again the act of working on music was always the most rewarding but also the most terrifying
8840132 touring was the reward but the act of creating and self examination and looking in the mirror clearly at yourself that was something i dreaded so id put it off thats why there were so many gaps between records and turning to drugs and alcohol getting in control at the forefront of life and getting older too i realized i do like doing this it doesnt have to be terrifying and going easier on myself doesnt mean the results drop to zero
8840133 getting off interscope at first it was great i was finally rid of these guys im not singling out interscope but they dont know what theyre doing but then it was great but now what do we do
8840134 these are the cards ive been dealt this is the climate right now and theres nobody to tell me no that combined with feeling generally good about my art and feeling excited again has left me reinvigorated theres not this giant obstacle of bureaucracy in the way
8840135 rob estes character actually grew up in beverly hills he was the next door neighbor to one of our previous characters
8840136 theyve moved back and its how they handle this new world well be using people from the previous show in the new one and they will organically work with our characters
8840137 i was the one major fan of the cast i was 1 when the show came out but my mom raised me on it basically i am very shell shocked every time i meet one of the old cast members and see the old high school and stuff like that its been quite a trip
8840138 the drama was something that you hadnt really seen on television before and the issues were real you felt like you could finally relate to people that you were seeing on tv it was serious issues and it showed the serious consequences and it wasnt just a glamorous package put together for everyones eyes
8840139 she is also moving to beverly hills for the first time so its an adjustment for her because shes never lived outside of kansas
8840140 i think that shes a contemporary mom shes got a career shes grounded she has a good relationship with her husband i think its all based in shes based in reality
8840141 one of the differences from the original show is that we are really having a strong adult story line
8840142 we also want to have this point of view that there are these other families in beverly hills who weve seen in this generation of baby booming parents who just think theyre parenting by giving their kids money and excess and clothing and no rules and we have a strong point of view that kids need boundaries need rules and thats one of the things thats going to influence the show
8840143 were just trying to tell the best stories we can were trying to ground it we grew up sort of in the producer judd apatow family
8840144 best not to tangle with the police in china or in russia especially in russia
8840145 kill off all my demons roy and my angels might die too
8840146 in russia we have expression with lies you can go forward but you cannot go back
8840147 we are no longer astonished at the activity shown by some butterflies such as the sphinx when they rifle the flowers of our gardens they flit from one to the other with the speed of an arrow and like the hummingbirds they hang motionless before the corolla plunging their long tongues to the bottom in order to sip the nectar whilst their wings are agitated by movements which the eye cannot follow the delicacy of these aerial oars is no less remarkable than their movements however gently we take hold of the wing of a butterfly our fingers never leave it without having some particles adhering which seem only fine dust the source of the magnificent coloring of the insect but when this dust is submitted to microscopic examination the observer is surprised to see that each of these grains represents a little flattened plate lengthened out and of a delicate and complicated structure which reflects the most magical colors one of its extremities is generally toothed more or less deeply whilst the other displays only a little pedicle by which each imperceptible scale is attached to the transparent membrane of the wing
8840148 if i tried to ride in on a motorcycle id probably kill myself
8840149 performing stand up at such a massive venue is rare for comedians
8840150 ive always been interested in language and humor in general
8840151 we were having a good time and would collect until we each had three or four
8840152 it broke up the work day when we were doing it we were all more or less local we started batting these back and forth mostly by fax and i started a file it waxed and waned and they went on to more adult pursuits i couldnt get it out of my head
8840153 im better at explaining where and how it should be sold rather than to whom
8840154 its small in size so its inherently gift oriented an impulse buy

8840160 its going to be the speech of obamas life and that guy can make a speech
8840161 people will be talking about tonight for many many years
8840162 and it just seems to get nastier but obama has somehow created this personality thats above the fray pleasant natural graceful
8840163 the people in denver are wonderful but the police theyre over the top theyre wearing riot gear i mean really
8840164 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time
8840165 if you were flying over this in an airplane you would never believe this is a political rally
8840166 there is a place for talking about all this ephemera
8840167 the most serious financial crisis since the depression global warming high costs a more competitive world
8840168 the last time i was here i watched a television crew shooting baywatch
8840169 of course the producer was correct i was confused i had confabulated the experience of seeing something in a movie with real life
8840170 obviously were not trying to prevent the hospital from providing care
8840171 strikes are always a difficult situation for everyone involved but we are comfortable the proposals we have offered to the union so far have been very fair and equitable
8840172 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8840173 were looking to be sure we dont fall behind in making mexico a strategic logistics platform for trade and global investment
8840174 wotdefokyouwan yeah im busy man im out im out cuz i go out sometimes cuz my dad sed i could fuck well i cant i cant fuk you bitch fuk cuz i got stuff to do stuff fuk
8840175 but then i realized that he couldnt have gotten any further on the bus if he tried
8840176 and the strain on his knees was too much for him to ride standing anyway but still i didnt care for the way he spoke to his friends or whoever called him
8840177 he probably gets treated like that himself i cant imagine its easy for a kid that big
8840178 the kids with him didnt treat him badly ive known some pretty big people some of them were full of bitterness and some of them werent i cant help but think that some of his anger is expressing itself in fat and and some of that fat is expressing itself in anger
8840179 im aware that we havent always met your expectations and id like to talk about how we could improve our performance
8840180 give it to a slut and shell screw for a night bring a slut home and shell screw for a lifetime
8840181 nutrition accomplished your recipe guide to the last 100 days of the bush presidency
8840182 its one of those events that you love to hate
8840183 its huge for the restaurant on friday and saturday but the following two or three weeks are massive as far as a return
8840184 and they might not come in right away but during the slow months december january and february we get people from the taste
8840185 i hate to toot my own horn but our food is good there at the taste
8840186 if you dont love what you do then why do it
8840187 gisela no ten a la cifra real de votos cuando anunci los ganadores de su reality
8840188 womens gold tapestry and the gallery of presidents a collection of oil portraits donated by a colorado couple
8840189 for these guys particularly mimi and dolly the elephants its kind of business as usual for them
8840190 they know its evening so thats different but their keepers are still around i think they think its weird but its fine
8840191 its kind of always been the focus of this event highlighting local folks
8840192 were spreading it out this year so people can get all the food and beer they need
8840193 the brew is the largest fundraiser we have for that
8840194 this one actually goes into the foundation while others go to capital projects
8840195 were very careful about sound levels so we always have extra keepers around in case it seems like anyones getting uncomfortable
8840196 we have to be careful where we hang things with that trunk she can get ahold of anything
8840197 i hope that the justice department will raise some strenuous objections to this deal but the zero hour is upon us
8840198 when we announced our deal with yahoo we agreed to give the department of justice several months to review the deal before we began implementing it and we continue to cooperate with regulators as that process continues
8840199 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward
8840200 it could have the potential to hurt the company long term
8840201 some investors would be likely to think that no ceo could come in and match the performance that jobs has done
8840202 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8840203 once content has been identified as infringing veohs digital fingerprint technology also prevents the same infringing content from ever being uploaded again
8840204 all of this indicates that veoh has taken steps to reduce not foster the incidence of copyright infringement on its web site
8840205 after an accident like that people are a lot more cautious
8840206 that particular accident is very unlikely to happen again either because of improvements or the fact that substandard platforms arent here anymore
8840207 i think this is overdone because youre going to have shut ins at the very least and then well talk about what kind of damage we have
8840208 we have some extremely high bandwidth users that consume a disproportionate amount of data and that can degrade service for others
8840209 to maintain a high quality of service for users weve gone with this
8840210 this wouldnt be necessary if comcast had chosen to expand its capacity
8840211 unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve
8840212 every service provider has to do something to make sure data is flowing as efficiently as possible
8840213 we have been going at top speed up to now
8840214 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8840215 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese with us
8840216 massenvernichtungswaffen haben sie die jetzt im irak gefunden oder suchen sie noch danach
8840217 ich bin kein psychologe und wei nicht wie botschafter tschurkin zu den freien assoziationen kommt die wir von ihm geh rt haben
8840218 dass jemand in den vereinigten staaten diesen konflikt absichtlich mit dem ziel erzeugt hat die situation zu verschlechtern und einem der kandidaten im kampf um das amt des us pr sidenten einen vorteil zu verschaffen
8840219 nat rlich h tte ich mir gew nscht dass sie mir da gefolgt w ren dass sie sich zumindest enthalten h tten
8840220 da werden wir drauf achten dass sie diese dinge einhalten
8840221 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8840222 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8840223 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8840224 as far as julys data is concerned the situation for industrial output doesnt look so bad as it showed relatively firm shipments while the inventory ratio declined
8840225 but for the outlook while domestic demand is already weak there is a strong possibility a slowdown in external demand will have a full impact later on so we cant be optimistic
8840226 at first glance cpis rise above 2 may be seen as a factor to prompt the boj to raise rates soon but as it has been saying the impact of high oil prices will come off in the future
8840227 forty seconds goes by a lot faster up there than it does for a fan on the sideline
8840228 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
8840229 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
8840230 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
8840231 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
8840232 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
8840233 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for he added
8840234 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted
8840235 im just going to try to score because i know those guys dont want to run
8840236 if they need to have bigger boobies then i can just stuff the bra i have definitely lost work over the years because my chest isnt bigger than it is and because i dont have platinum blond hair
8840237 were afraid of poverty like its something to be ashamed of
8840238 nobody ever says that but im always having to scream about it
8840239 if you find somebody who loves the world and people vote em into office look just a little deeper
8840240 i cant remember if it was upstate new york or minnesota but wherever the hell i was i saw it on the tv screen and the eye of that hurricane was so humongous
8840241 i was calling everybody i could get the hell out of there
8840242 you could tell it was going to be bad news man
8840243 got everything i could get my hands on to read
8840244 if you find somebody who loves the world and people vote em into office look just a little deeper
8840245 i feel like weve been lied to weve been hustled were still being hustled i did this little sippiana hericane thing in a rush after the storms but that didnt say anything about the issues going down so i tried to start making some statements and bring out points and stuff
8840246 under a hoodoo moon the life of the night tripper
8840247 theres so much music that came out of new orleans and spread itself around the world its not hard for me to find a way to play in just about anything you know
8840248 everybody thats on this record is connected to the thing
8840249 ani difranco offered to do it before wed even started recording and i think she did a gorgeous job on what she did willie came in and put a vocal on promises promises bobby charles has been trying to get me to record that one for a long time so it was easy to get willie to do that one
8840250 and then eric he came in there and really did just what i was hoping for
8840251 i thought he might do one track or two tracks and he did three
8840252 and thats what i liked with everybody i dont like people to feel handcuffed to anything i just want them to play what they feel like if music feels handcuffed then somethings drastically wrong
8840253 i think fortune magazine said it better than i could where did all the money go
8840254 says dr john who recalls getting cellphone calls during the hurricane from friends who eventually drowned when the levees broke and their homes flooded
8840255 the 80 billion sent to help new orleans from all over the world i dont think anybody i know got any of that
8840256 its not a new orleans thing to not ask what happened to it in new orleans we ask the questions
8840257 i see little things coming from places every now and then thank you for writing that stuff like that
8840258 i took the term the meaning that new orleans is the city people go to to forget their cares to the city that care actually forgot i thought that was a good title for the record
8840259 to get some of the songs that we didnt use to other artists they dont have to do what i did but maybe they can make statements about what they see whatever applies to them
8840260 when he was spoken to by the police mr nemer conceded his speeding was stupid
8840261 its out of my control and when thats the case its not something to waste time worrying about but im sure theres something to it and they have plans for it
8840262 if they didnt he wouldnt have been taking ground balls over there
8840263 i think its a situation where sometimes guys get labeled
8840264 its a big part of this game where they dont let guys go out there and play if youre not out there within four five years thats what you just sort of become
8840265 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8840266 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8840267 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8840268 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8840269 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8840270 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8840271 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8840272 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8840273 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8840274 they want to speed the game up make the call
8840275 the way they are building them now with all the angles its tougher to see what is going on
8840276 it doesnt really matter either way for me i hope it doesnt distract anything i hope they get the calls right
8840277 this government will not be bidding for the 2018 commonwealth games
8840278 the main reason is that we have got a critical need for infrastructure in this state over the next decade or two
8840279 there is a lot better ways to spend 2 billion than on on a bunch of sporting stadiums that will offer us a b grade sporting event for 10 days when australia can beat itself in the swimming pool
8840280 i am not going to see this state with the 2 billion of expenditure on sporting stadiums when the most pressing need for our state is economic infrastructure social infrastructure to underpin a significant economic boom which will put enormous pressure on housing education hospitals road and rail infrastructure
8840281 i think the remarks reveal an acting premier with no vision no ideas and nothing exciting to offer south australia for the future
8840282 elevate myself more in terms of my profession to tap into the international market
8840283 twelve years ago there were 1 2 million wildebeests last year we had only 300 000 if nothing is done it could put pay to the migration forever
8840284 we could be looking at a repetition of the bison and buffalo disappearance in north america
8840285 the maasai had to make a choice because the pastoralist lifestyle was no longer sustainable
8840286 the new arrangement is that having wildlife earns you money whether there are tourists or not
8840287 wheat and maize you can grow anywhere in the world but these people dont have the efficiency per acre that others have and when prices drop theyll be the first to lose out
8840288 in any business the more exotic a product the higher price it commands with this wildlife they have one of the best exotic products in the world
8840289 maasai mara is a brand just like coca cola theres no reason it cant generate its own income
8840290 we used to take predators as our enemies but maasais are natural conservationists
8840291 but now we see animals as very precious they are a life support to many
8840292 this directive was very much needed for the mara but it should have been targeted only at the protected area because a blanket freeze is going to put into question the development of responsible conservancies
8840293 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8840294 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as
8840295 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8840296 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8840297 never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8840298 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8840299 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8840300 im just so proud were standing here cheering for a black man
8840301 sal teen mnr van der sandt sy maatskappy en moontlik ook brikor uitgereik word
8840302 we all were involved in the doe matter it should not be blamed on one person
8840303 they had signed doe off the book because they were interested in sawyers interim leadership
8840304 a government can not hold into account a truce signed with rebels
8840305 we carried him on the base while ecomog took care of his soldiers whether they died or escaped i do not know
8840306 if the death of the thirteen men the death of tolbert the death of journalist charles gbenyon general thomas quiwonkpa and many others were televised i too decided to televise does death so that people would see it
8840307 men were put in a combat against the regime that murdered their children i said sorry to doe family am i a coward to continue to say sorry have you heard with your ears that the krahn people have come to tell the nimba people sorry
8840308 does regime did not favor my people they killed them like chickens and created sleepless nights for them what do you expect me to do to a man reflecting my mind on atrocities most of does children were born by women from nimba county yet he treated our people cruelly should i have given room to human rights to stall the things that i wanted done
8840309 sawyer was extraordinarily wicked after we had vowed to have him serve as the interim leader and brought him to monrovia as a leader on a platter of gold he called us thieves when he changed the liberian bank notes
8840310 sawyer is ungrateful he siphoned some the money and allegedly built his home in the us when sawyer was interim leader he stole money which he did nothing with neither did he account for it now he is made chairperson of the countrys governance commission what will happen to the country sawyer is corrupt
8840311 i tied journalist isaac bantu for suppressing my release i tied him seriously and had him in my living room at my base for seven hours
8840312 michael doe died of misinformation from former miss liberia annie broaderick that angered me annie said that michael brought the npfl to attack us and that he was collaborating with doe soldiers so he was shot in the chest his death was not intentional
8840313 this is our national dress you dont see them much now in the summer but in the winter everyone wears them because it keeps the cold out
8840314 today the customers especially the foreigners prefer the imports god only knows why
8840315 they should buy from us and support the local industry
8840316 in italy you see women wearing keffiyehs around their necks are those people terrorists
8840317 we buy from hirbawi because he makes all these colours the foreigners love them
8840318 it is a symbol of palestine and of chairman arafat but not of terrorism the israelis came here and made problems for us and all we are doing is defending our rights
8840319 elle tait peut tre nerveuse plus que moi en tout cas a poursuivi la fran aise elle avait la pression de se battre pour garder sa place de n 1 mondiale elle a t bless e r cemment un pouce cest difficile pour les joueurs de sa stature alors que pour nous tout est du bonus

8840323 jai vu un spectacle de tango tokyo au d but des ann es 90 et cette danse ma tellement mu que jai d cid de lui consacrer mon existence
8840324 when you look at hockey on the tv its always the red wings or pittsburgh playing
8840325 youre always going to pay attention because its attractive hockey its a lot of offense and a lot of great players i want to play that way i liked playing like that in pittsburgh and
8840326 across a range of sports we found that wearing red is consistently associated with a higher probability of winning
8840327 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
8840328 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room
8840329 we know what the issues are we can google the problem
8840330 to learn about the solutions of how to fight against voter apathy how to get people registered to vote and how to get people to vote come election day
8840331 number one hes the most authentic person youll ever meet
8840332 hes a complete truth teller and hes very authentic and hes extremely genuine
8840333 it seems that theyre always talking about extremely serious issues
8840334 but hes an extremely extremely witty and funny guy and i just appreciate him so much
8840335 i just feel blessed to be a part of it
8840336 every major historic event in history needs a devoted and excited audience and i get to be one of those people
8840337 a diplomat always remembers a womans birthday but never remembers her age
8840338 how come whenever they come in the house shes never awake
8840339 shes only a couple of days old pretty much all she does is eat poop and sleep
8840340 siamo ancora nella fase in cui occorre ridurre i costi di produzione si tratta di una fase molto lunga
8840341 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
8840342 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
8840343 you are so focused on your possessions that you dont notice anything else
8840344 you didnt even notice that your left arm is missing from the elbow down it must have been torn off when the truck hit you
8840345 because when you were born a petal fell on your head
8840346 because when you were born a rose fell on your head
8840347 honey could you fix the light in the hallway its been flickering for weeks now
8840348 fix the light now does it look like i have a g e logo printed on my forehead i dont think so
8840349 well then could you fix the fridge door it wont close properly
8840350 fix the fridge door does it look like i have westinghouse written on my forehead i dont think so
8840351 could you please fix the steps to the front door then theyre about to break
8840352 im not a damn carpenter and i dont want to fix steps
8840353 does it look like i have ace hardware written on my forehead i dont think so ive had enough of this im going to the bar
8840354 well when you left i sat outside and cried just then a nice young man asked me what was wrong and i told him he offered to do all the repairs and all i had to do was either go to bed with him or bake him a cake
8840355 instead of turning my lights off i littered and beat kittens same thing right
8840356 depends on what you beat them with was it recyclable
8840357 why are you here on this beautiful day getting drunk
8840358 well i took her left leg and tied it to the post on the left with some rope then i sat down and continued to milk her just as the bucket was about full she took her right leg and kicked it over
8840359 i took her right leg and tied it to the post on the right then i sat back down and continued to milk her then just as i had got the bucket about full the stupid cow knocked the bucket over with her tail
8840360 well i didnt have any rope left so i took off my belt and tied her tail to the rafter
8840361 a genie in the back hell grant you one wish

8840367 jamie and i have done the research and figured that the only way to end the debate about the myth of the apollo moon landing is to go there
8840368 the thing that ive found over the years is that there is always a certain segment of people out there who will refuse to believe despite overwhelming evidence those diehards will never be convinced while everyone else will have fun watching us take on the hoax
8840369 in my experience you cant convince a conspiracy theorist that the sky is blue even if he is looking up
8840370 i have confidence that most of our audience will be satisfied
8840371 i dont think the diehard believers will ever be convinced that the moon landing happened no matter what evidence is shown
8840372 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8840373 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8840374 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8840375 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8840376 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8840377 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8840378 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time im not ready to take a 10 chance on change

8840384 i said last year that the greens were awful and something needed to be done
8840385 im not a bad putter and i cant remember the last time i three putted from 18 inches
8840386 at the end of the week unfortunately the tournament could be won or lost by luck on the greens
8840387 the guys going for the ryder cup are the people i feel really sorry for there is a lot riding on that
8840388 they are going to be feeling pressure as it is and you dont want to be standing over a three footer with so much doubt in your mind not knowing if the ball is going to run straight
8840389 the greens are not overly smooth but i felt i was a little bit unlucky every time i hit it in the rough i got a bad lie
8840390 i dont think ive blown myself out of it i could have done but i didnt
8840391 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday and ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself
8840392 we didnt think lets help this person we just did it and hope someone would do the same for us
8840393 um because i know what you like and i listen to you

8840396 they told me they know they want to get rid of samak thaksin and all their cronies but the problem is they dont seem to know what will happen if they do
8840397 the leader of the pad sondhi limthongkul has told me that the entire political system needs to be changed and says that perhaps thailand isnt ready for full democracy because of the endemic corruption
8840398 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
8840399 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
8840400 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
8840401 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
8840402 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
8840403 ser complicado sabemos que esta eliminatoria es de 180 minutos hicimos 90 buenos al conseguir el gol de visita y ahora hay que replantearnos para hacerles da o en casa

8840412 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8840413 afortunadamente se empez bien es un buen resultado m s no definitivo estos torneos son muy cerrados y no te garantiza nada un 3 1 todav a hay que jugar el partido y no hablar
8840414 despu s de perder un partido no quieres repetirlo pero tambi n es cierto que nosotros queremos seguir as el equipo est bien el s bado el encuentro ser dif cil pero estamos mentalizados para sacar un buen resultado y seguir arriba
8840415 todo est permitido creo que mientras m s se piense de esa manera se va a mantener el invicto pero no es algo que nos quite el sue o hay que ocuparnos en mejorar d a con d a el funcionamiento hacerlo mejor y los resultados se dar n por s solos
8840416 la competencia interna es muy importante claro que a uno le gustar a jugar le gustar a participar pero hay veces que las molestias tienen que ser bien encausadas no se deben de malinterpretar hay que trabajar hay que entrenar cuando nos toca jugar uno siempre quiere recibir el apoyo del compa ero cuando no se juega hay que manifestarlo y esperar su oportunidad de trabajar para ello
8840417 el estilo de este equipo es el l der es lo que nos a mantenido entre quien entre hace bien la cosas y hay que tratar de aprovechar las oportunidades que se tienen

8840421 yeah i think we could make that work put mikes name in for the press pass
8840422 millions of low earners are set to lose out as a result of the governments failure to listen to concerns on this issue
8840423 this is not a surprise but its a worry a number of companies are considering similar moves and there will be a steady flow of these announcements unless the government tackles the issue
8840424 it is the legislative framework which we need to provide us with a regime in which we have greater ability and freedom to develop our business more profitably over the long term
8840425 this is a valid question for boards to ask are we domiciled in the best place tax is a really important part of financial management
8840426 this is not good news for the uk it puts pressure on the treasury to come up with a robust package to convince businesses that having their headquarters here is a benefit
8840427 the uk continues to offer one of the most competitive business tax regimes of any major economy including the lowest headline rate of corporation tax in the g7

8840431 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8840432 it is not going to get any better for 18 months
8840433 there has been a bit of a spike in fashion sales in the last two to three weeks but that has been driven by very aggressive discounting so very little has flowed through to margins
8840434 the board is likely to request administration under the new rules at this meeting
8840435 if it doesnt happen alitalia will be dead in a couple of weeks
8840436 the government is essentially creating chapter 11 law from scratch
8840437 next year will see fuel prices up by probably a further 15 17 per cent which would increase the loss to close to a sum in the three figure millions
8840438 at best in the next couple of years we will be seeking to minimise our losses
8840439 there are no current issues over our banking covenants that are keeping me awake at night
8840440 the uk motor retail sector has faced a challenging six months through weak demand and rising vehicle ownership costs we have reacted quickly to the market changes improving our competitiveness in used cars cutting our cost base and reducing borrowings
8840441 large executive and off road vehicles were the hardest hit
8840442 we expect that the current price correction in the used car market has some way to go although we anticipate that it will have run its course by the end of the year
8840443 were switching our tax base out of the uk because it will save us a shed load of cash

8840447 check whether window is obscured return t if window is fully obscured by some other window otherwise a list of windows partially obscuring window in particular return nil if window is unobscured note that if a list of partially obscuring windows is returned taken together they may or may not fully obscure window
8840448 compute the visibility of window from the stacking order this should work even with the composite extension which appears to disable visibilitynotify events note that deciding between fully and partially obscured may require quite a bit of computation if you do not need that distinction window obscured should be faster
8840449 if the window is at its highest possible position then lower it to its lowest possible position otherwise raise it as far as allowed

8840453 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8840454 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8840455 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8840456 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8840457 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8840458 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8840459 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8840460 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8840461 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8840462 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the world trade organization
8840463 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8840464 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8840465 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8840466 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
8840467 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8840468 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8840469 fighting and confronting saddams regime despite the risks that surrounded him
8840470 the americans know very well that such people were brought up and trained in iranian intelligence system
8840471 the detention of al lami is part of a chain of events that will lead to the uncovering of others
8840472 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8840473 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8840474 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8840475 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8840476 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8840477 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8840478 im acting based on what my obligations are under that law and based upon what city council has asked me to do
8840479 the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8840480 youll have to do the best you can we dont have subpoena power theres no argument about that
8840481 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8840482 some of them were decapitated some did not have a hand each body was photographed
8840483 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8840484 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life
8840485 is not recalling a product that it did not make and sell
8840486 they wouldnt be able to be in business if they did that
8840487 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8840488 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8840489 i was very nervous about his arrival saturday about how i looked about how we were going to feel when we got home

8840491 at times there were close to 250 people i was responsible for
8840492 everybody here and there was very supportive were very thankful it was a positive experience as much as it can be
8840493 my son its his second time deployed and my brother its his third tour there i wanted to do my part to help them out
8840494 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith

8840497 son cosas que siempre pasan estoy tranquilo es una l stima porque estuve esperando esta oportunidad de poder alinear desde el inicio y me pasa esto pero por algo suceden las cosas estoy seguro de que vendr algo mejor
8840498 hemos trabajado en corregir los errores ofensivos y aunque carecemos de gol no importa qui n sea el que anote sino que el equipo gane ya que esto es un deporte colectivo y no de un solo individuo

8840500 hillary is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes 2 of us
8840501 i want all of you that supported hillary to support barack obama
8840502 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation
8840503 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8840504 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8840505 in this case the 3rd time is not the charm
8840506 you are defined by your sense of honor and youre redeemed by your loyalty
8840507 we dont have to accept the situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8840508 with the standard residential rate currently standing at 9 43 per cent this may prove costly
8840509 if you used one to get over a one off blip and youve got yourself back on track over the last two or three years you should be able to approach the standard mortgage market as long as you have the equity on your house
8840510 however there are people who have used sub prime mortgages to just continually recycle their debt for these people this could be the end of the line and they could be facing repossession
8840511 were switching our tax base out of the uk because it will save us a shed load of cash
8840512 well be domiciled in dublin before you can say wheres my tax return
8840513 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff

8840517 failure to pay any amounts provided for under this article may result in the filing of a lien against the property of the registered owner
8840518 such lien shall be subject to foreclosure as provided by law
8840519 so the city of sarasota and i guess a lot of other cities if you get a bunch of parking tickets they lock up your car they dont put a lien on your home
8840520 if theres no real property to put a lien on theres the potential of personal property
8840521 i think theres a cost benefit analysis as to how much effort you put into that
8840522 legal opinions indicate that automated enforcement in the state of florida remains illegal
8840523 were investing in companies that are expected to growth significantly on the back of this strong economic growth
8840524 at a lot of our games wed have the team a few moms and dads and a handful of students
8840525 about the only time it was easy for our fans to see us was when we played at st davids in raleigh
8840526 the congregation at the church all the students and staff at the school and the day care parents all know about the game
8840527 having a home game is an encouragement to our players
8840528 i think we are going to have more school pride and that the school is going to come together more
8840529 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming but also more people involved in exercising
8840530 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8840531 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
8840532 you dont ever want to get swept especially in the situation were in
8840533 we had to really fight to win that last one
8840534 weve been stale we havent been able to get the big hit we havent been able to make a big pitch
8840535 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8840536 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8840537 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8840538 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8840539 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8840540 forty seconds goes by a lot faster up there than it does for a fan on the sideline
8840541 the incident in charlotte really forged a bond between the entire team it really welded those guys together very tightly
8840542 they felt very strongly they had some injustice done to them at charlotte and i felt it really motivated them
8840543 a second win is very important especially in the same season there are a lot of drivers who can say they won a race but theres not a lot that can say they won two
8840544 it puts your foot not just in the door but it gets you all the way in
8840545 it doesnt seem like it but weve been racing like 17 straight weeks now and nashville was almost 10 races ago we were on a mini drought
8840546 we saw a lot of development in him last year after we made the driver change we put him in the car and he did exactly what dale jr thought he would do
8840547 some of the race tracks weve been to this year hes been a rookie at and he hasnt performed like a rookie were working hard for this championship were going to give clint a run for it
8840548 i think working with tony sr hes a great mentor and ive experienced that myself
8840549 tony sr has been a good leader he gets people under to work hard in any situation and put forth the effort
8840550 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his tires is what he did
8840551 i feel like i was extremely justified to do what i did
8840552 i needed to do it and thats the way it went lets make it real clear i am not apologizing for it and thats that
8840553 i dont think there is a right or a wrong i dont think there are any rules
8840554 the way this works is the way a real smart racer explained it to me after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8840555 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me
8840556 afterwards he busch said sorry man my car was just faster so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made
8840557 you just have to know at the end of the day the way you race people thats how they are going to race you back
8840558 if you can live with that and respect other people on the track you wont have a lot of problems
8840559 verblijdt u te allen tijde bidt zonder ophouden dankt onder alles want dat is de wil gods in christus jezus ten opzichte van u dooft de geest niet uit veracht de profetie n niet maar toetst alles en behoudt het goede onthoudt u van alle soort van kwaad
8840560 dat hij ook mij gegeven is om mij door waar geloof aan christus en al zijn weldaden deel te geven mij te troosten en eeuwig bij mij te blijven
8840561 god is licht en in hem is in het geheel geen duisternis
8840562 is er soms een vader onder u die als zijn zoon hem om een vis vraagt hem voor een vis een slang zal geven of als hij om een ei vraagt hem een schorpioen zal geven indien dan gij hoewel gij slecht zijt goede gaven weet te geven aan uw kinderen hoeveel te meer zal uw vader uit de hemel de heilige geest geven aan hen die hem daarom bidden
8840563 maar gij geliefden bewaart uzelf in de liefde gods door uzelf op te bouwen in uw allerheiligst geloof en door te bidden in de heilige geest verwachtende de ontferming van onze here jezus christus ten eeuwigen leven
8840564 een gebed dat door de heilige geest gewekt en gedragen wordt en in diepe afhankelijkheid van de heilige geest gebeden wordt
8840565 en hij de god des vredes heilige u geheel en al en geheel uw geest ziel en lichaam moge bij de komst van onze here jezus christus blijken in allen dele onberispelijk bewaard te zijn die u roept is getrouw hij zal het ook doen

8840567 for me the running is not as tiresome but i didnt think standing was going to be so exhausting
8840568 it was something we didnt decide until we were in warm ups
8840569 it wasnt like they were jumping for joy or anything but i think they respected the decision
8840570 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8840571 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8840572 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8840573 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8840574 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8840575 its a big step to actually put it out there
8840576 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me
8840577 if you shoot under 70 everybody will understand you if you dont they wont want to talk to you anyway
8840578 well have to watch the tape and evaluate it and see what in the world happened with tommy
8840579 i know this he threw the ball better in practice than he did out there
8840580 a mining convention will be drawn up for the exploration and exploitation stages of the project
8840581 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8840582 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8840583 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
8840584 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
8840585 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
8840586 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
8840587 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
8840588 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for he added
8840589 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted
8840590 im just going to try to score because i know those guys dont want to run
8840591 i told him to take his time and shoot it low so we could get a chance for a reflection
8840592 it was well struck and hard to hang onto for sure
8840593 i thought during the first half we controlled the game
8840594 but i told our kids at halftime to play like were down 1 0 i knew theyd be dangerous
8840595 ive got a lot of kids who can play a lot of different positions

8840597 judged on community benefits environmental impact and cost rehabilitation and refurbishment is clearly the way forward
8840598 it is less destructive helps preserve the existing community saves money and offers revitalisation without losing the enduring qualities of these characterful and much loved terraced streets
8840599 with good imaginative design these houses can be easily adapted to offer the variety of housing which the pathfinder agencies say is required for the area
8840600 shown that by extending the houses in various ways and creating new private or shared space around them you can create a wide variety of different accommodation
8840601 i think its vital as a concept that they will retain the things which already exist and enhance them
8840602 so the houses will become much more attractive than they already are
8840603 our plans for the regeneration of the toxteth street area in openshaw have been drawn up following consultation with local residents
8840604 these plans will transform an area of poor quality housing a poor environment and significant crime and anti social behaviour into a sustainable family focused residential area where once again existing residents will choose to stay and new families will choose to come to live providing significant long term benefit to the wider openshaw area
8840605 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights

8840608 the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this

8840619 it was sort of a nuts and bolts how to win an election for women young people
8840620 we started with a ghost writer but then he ran away for good
8840621 but in recalling events we realized that even though we grew up in the same family we perceived things a little differently so we decided to arrange it thematically
8840622 sometimes the three of us would be in the same room other times i would write something up and then richard would call and ask questions

8840664 there is an adage that the best sermons are not preached they are lived if you look at the life of senator mccain you see a life of courage of dedication of duty of honor of character of strength of patriotism in a measure that is epic
8840665 on the question of iraq john mccain has had the guts to stand out on his own arguing for what he thought was right and it turned out that he was right about the surge working to improve conditions in iraq
8840666 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8840667 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8840668 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8840669 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8840670 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8840671 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8840672 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion

8840676 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush estuvo en lo cierto el 90 por ciento de las veces
8840677 no s qu clase de vida piensa john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero sta es la que he tenido yo

8840680 i immediately feel compelled to just apologize to all of you
8840681 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore
8840682 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident

8840684 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8840685 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor

8840689 good judgement comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgement
8840690 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8840691 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8840692 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8840693 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8840694 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8840695 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8840696 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8840697 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8840698 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8840699 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8840700 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8840701 the story is very pessimistic it has a dark and gloomy texture that japanese movie fans do not find appealing in a comic hero film japanese movie fans expect such films to be fun and action packed for the hero to be attractive for the villain to be loud and outrageous and for the movie itself to be easy to understand and light
8840702 he no grow 5 000 feet or have smaller batman join him to form megabatman stupid round eyes we not intellested
8840703 the current of history meeting this new tide of hope
8840704 i was remembering the people who died to get where we are right now
8840705 people who gave their lives to be able to vote to be able to own a home to be able to live where they wanted to live all of that just came back and it brought tears to my eyes its a new day its a new day and im just so pleased
8840706 i always said whatever job you do do the best you can so i was good at picking cotton
8840707 but when i saw the white man weighing the cotton i said i got to get that position i was always looking to change things
8840708 the scene up there then was mostly blues rock and folk

8840718 i have witnessed incidents where he has used profanity at colleagues and exploded at colleagues he would disagree about something and then explode it was incidents of irrational behavior weve all had incidents where we have gotten angry but ive never seen anyone act like that
8840719 i think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president
8840720 slutsatsen av datan r att utrikeshandeln r livlinan f r ekonomin just nu

8840722 wir werden ende 2008 rund 96 prozent aller haushalte mit dsl versorgen und das in ber achtzig prozent aller anschl sse mit mehr als zwei megabit pro sekunde
8840723 die deutsche telekom ist sich ihrer verantwortung f r deutschland bewusst und erschlie t das land nahezu fl chendeckend mit schnellen internetanschl ssen

8840729 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8840730 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
8840731 i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million per year
8840732 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8840733 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8840734 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8840735 america is sinking and hes going to be the one that lifts us back up
8840736 and were worth that ultimately this isnt about barack it is so much about our future and what were going to do im so impassioned right now he really is for the people and thats why people are feeling so excited ive never been so excited about a candidate before
8840737 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to hope that we confess
8840738 from martin luther kings speech to where we are now who would have ever thought that a person of color would be sitting at the doorsteps of the white house to become president of the united states
8840739 can the administration seriously believe that if there were a comprehensive test ban our north atlantic treaty organization and asian allies would decide to abandon the nonproliferation treaty and develop their own nuclear weapons as a consequence
8840740 no one seriously versed in the field believes that they would respond in that way
8840741 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well
8840742 anyone could play against andorra but croatia is different you need players who are 100
8840743 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now
8840744 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8840745 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch
8840746 this is something very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8840747 i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8840748 since i came to united theyve always been the team everyone wants to beat so were all used to that
8840749 and winning the double was a great achievement but were not satisfied with that
8840750 its something we all spoke about when we came back in pre season we want more trophies
8840751 we dont want to be known as a team which won the double and that was it we want to make history
8840752 hopefully in the next few years we will too i think we can do great things because weve got experienced players and young lads who can only get better
8840753 hopefully we will all keep learning keep playing well and keep winning trophies
8840754 in five or six years i hope people are saying what a great team we became
8840755 after that game the dressing room was a horrible place to be
8840756 no words were said and club wise its the worst ive ever been in
8840757 we realised that with the other teams who were left in the competition we would have had a great chance to win the fa cup it was really disappointing
8840758 the important thing was to keep that feeling at the back of your mind and make sure we went on to win the premier league and champions league
8840759 if arsene said he needed 30 million for a striker he would get it no problem at all
8840760 it is not our decision who he spends money on and nor will it ever be we totally back arsene but there is a dual problem for him
8840761 if we were to buy the sort of big names that people talk about we would be looking at relatively mature players who then need to be integrated into the way we play
8840762 secondly it impacts on the youngsters and in many cases arsene thinks it is quicker for us to bring a player through our system but that does not mean all we are interested in is the artistic achievement award
8840763 we are not settling for second best we want to win trophies and i think it is time we did but arsene also believes in creating teams with a certain style
8840764 there were great hopes that we would buy heavily this summer but i would refute that we have not bought well nasri has two goals in two games at the emirates stadium and if ars ne could find the right player he would buy again but he hasnt
8840765 i hear all the time that we have no money but i just wish someone would take the time to look at our accounts this is a proper business which produces its own cash and lives or dies by its performances
8840766 our net payments are 20 million and the revenue increase from the new stadium is close to 50 million explain to me how that stadium is a drain on the club when it produces an extra 30 million a year
8840767 this constant suggestion that the stadium is bleeding us dry is crap the reality is our wage bill is very similar to manchester united substantially above liverpool and substantially below chelsea but that is to be expected

8840831 its only because we see the same people every day
8840832 youre new here and everyone wants to talk to you we love tourists
8840833 to me they really typify what it is to be a leader its about being a great person being a great student and being a great football player its about balancing all that stuff and taking all that stuff seriously
8840834 you have to have enough guts to say something have enough compassion to hug somebody and have enough concern to reach out to somebody
8840835 you have to be able to evaluate take the pulse of and be responsible for everybody and have the courage fortitude and insight to go out and do all those things those guys can do that
8840836 i bleed with these guys i sweat with these guys and we overcome adversity together so for it to come from them means a lot to all of us
8840837 ive had a lot of playing experience and all the guys feel that im somebody they can come and talk to about any matter in their life
8840838 right now were looking real good this is by far the best camp ive been in since ive been here these guys are real headstrong right now and are keeping their nose to the grindstone
8840839 in the first week of camp i came out to a few of the sessions for the younger guys and i told coach hagan that i was really excited about the backfield
8840840 just seeing the young guys practice out here and watching them improve has been exactly what i expected plus more
8840841 in the new offense there are more opportunities for me to be on the field be a part of the routes and be a part of the explosive plays rather than just lead blocking
8840842 that was one of my main focuses i didnt want anything to change
8840843 ive always been a person that leads by example ive never been a big rah rah speech kind of guy i speak from my heart and i leave it at that if the team needs some motivation i can help provide that but im just the person that i am and they chose me to be a captain for a reason im just going to be that person
8840844 is this the year oh my lord i think this is the year
8840845 as long as ron zook is there it will be hard for me to support the university of illinois football team
8840846 we selected jermyn consulting after competitive tender jermyns ability to take a strategic view of requirements and their knowledge of the education sector were key factors in our decision
8840847 we are delighted to be working with soas the college is clearly taking this issue very seriously as it begins to understand its vulnerabilities and appreciates the need to maintain continuity of operations we have the skills experience and process to analyse any organisations business continuity and it disaster recovery needs very effectively
8840848 the way that the business continuity management system is being developed has generated full buy in and engagement from the executive board and all levels of management business continuity will become part of our thinking at soas
8840849 jermyn consulting provides business continuity and it disaster recovery advice for organisations in the public and private sectors our aim is to help our clients become as ready as they can be we have the skills and experience to support business continuity management systems from their inception through to implementation testing and ongoing management
8840850 our next challenge is to embed business continuity practises into our thinking so we can do it ourselves in the future if anything goes wrong everyone in the organisation will know what to do
8840851 new businesses are the economic lifeblood of a community we value the role they play in building a towns prosperity through the generator business centre we want to offer a helping hand to local entrepreneurs many new enterprises fail in the early days our aim is to give them a head start with their business development so that they will be able to move on after three years to become fully fledged successful companies standing on their own two feet
8840852 the generator is an innovative and forward thinking initiative from merton council not many facilities offer the same level of flexibility support and cost certainty and these advantages will translate into greater small business success in the borough advanced communications are at the heart of the generator providing the scalable infrastructure to help mertons businesses achieve their potential we look forward to working with the generator and supporting its tenants success
8840853 getting everett over there is going to be a lot of help because we need some depth there
8840854 hes still got a lot to learn but hes got good feet and good hands im looking forward to watching him play
8840855 they are going to learn what its like to play in a game and they need that experience
8840856 so later on in the season if someone gets hurt or something its nothing new to them they are just going to be able to jump in and play football
8840857 all this experience its my time to step up ive been here and ive paid my dues so now its time for me to step up
8840858 they can say what they want were going to go out there and play football and were going to do it the way we want to do it
8840859 theyre used to winning these guys are going to come in here and play and theyre going to play their rear ends off anybody we play right now gets our hands full but especially a team like james madison that knows how to win
8840860 theyre going to run the option they are a very multiple offensive football team that can power you or finesse you either one
8840861 saturdays game has got a little flavor of an afc east matchup here
8840862 he had a real clear thought that he wanted to be in college coaching im sure the jets didnt want him to leave so that was unlike my situation
8840863 college football is different than the nfl football college football is kind of stand on the edge of the pool and jump right in and see what the temperature is once you get in it
8840864 thats why it seems to take a while for things to level out to see what the landscape really looks like in college football
8840865 i dont know if theres a trend to that or if thats enough for a trend but college football is a fun place to work and i think some of our guys are finding that out
8840866 when ive been asked about our style or our team in the past
8840867 ive just usually said look we just coach the team the way that we think it needs to be coached
8840868 we have some more days of practice and well get them ready we have a lot more learning to do and we need to familiarize ourselves more with the process
8840869 were ready for a game in the sense that were just anxious to play someone else
8840870 i feel our offense is game ready we know theres going to be mistakes but i think were ready to play that game with us knowing the assignments and were ready mentally
8840871 it was very frustrating to see that and im sure it was frustrating for fans i just want us to play hard no matter the situation we just need to get after it
8840872 i dont want to let anyone down i know the excitement is there and theres no one more excited than me i cant let that affect me and i have to look at the reality and see what i can do to get this football team ready
8840873 i think weve got a good corps to work with potentially
8840874 at least from the place kicking standpoint im a lot more optimistic than maybe i would have been a couple weeks ago and i think the same thing about our returners
8840875 if we dont start getting a lot of injuries that type of thing i think we have the potential to be better there
8840876 ryan last year as a freshman had his ups and downs especially early
8840877 but i think he kind of grew and matured as the season went on and were hoping that he picks up from where he left off last year
8840878 you know ryan has a tremendous leg but with a lot of young players you need to see them be more consistent
8840879 she was really hated and that was weird and sad
8840880 i thought theater would be the end of the road
8840881 it was a terrifying role to take on it encompassed so many taboos
8840882 im very excited about coming down here its a great town and i love being involved with football schools
8840883 the people here in college station make the transition very easy because everyone has such a positive approach to everything so its been easy for my wife and i to fit in
8840884 i grew up in norman went to school in nebraska and now i am here so i have been fortunate enough to be around some fan bases who love football as much as i do
8840885 we have several people on the staff here that coached me while i was at nebraska
8840886 ive known coach sherman for a few years now so i have a lot of confidence in what we are trying to get done
8840887 intensely loyal fans that have very strong opinions about their sports teams
8840888 i strive for playing in front of the big crowds
8840889 hes showing a lot of confidence now and hes making the big throws and big plays that we all believe he can make in the game
8840890 i guess you could say i have underachieved since ive been here
8840891 so im ready to get on the upswing and show gamecock nation what i can do
8840892 i practice against some of the best corners in the nation
8840893 im pretty confident that i can handle anybody as far as a corner one on one lets go at it
8840894 thats one thing i like about this football team is weve got good leadership we have good senior leadership the unity council is stepping to the forefront its a good thing from my standpoint i feel good theyve taken great ownership of the program
8840895 unfortunately you get to the opening week of the season and theres a lot of high school coaches and teams that are just starting
8840896 you come off of the summer and a lot of these guys have been taking unofficial trips and been traveling around and their coaches really want them to concentrate on what they have
8840897 its so ing cute its the quintessential little bungalow home
8840898 hes real laid back from the standpoint that he wants to let his players play
8840899 he had chris paul and jason kidd as point guards who are very intelligent since im a point guard watching them they were running the show out there and coach k was just kind of pointing at them they looked like they had fun playing with him and i cant wait for him get back
8840900 they definitely ran a lot of our transition sets and its fun what the pro guys do with it because you get a different look on how they read stuff and what they do in certain situations
8840901 a lot of the plays that they did run we do run so it definitely helps us as a team
8840902 i cant be no more confident than i am right now
8840903 i had to have something special about me to make it back from this injury
8840904 that delone had played football for so long and hadnt got injured
8840905 its so simple but it just slapped us all in the face and it was like from then on i knew he would do what he needed to do to get back to where he wanted to be
8840906 i mean i already know everything about myself i dont question nothing about myself
8840907 there were times when i didnt want to be around nobody really didnt want to talk really didnt want to open up
8840908 and im not a person that opens up a lot so i was pretty much just being around but in the background with a fake smile so nobody could talk to me
8840909 finally i just told them like i am depressed i do wish i could help watching that season was the hardest thing i could ever do but talking to them and letting them know that made it better
8840910 i wasnt holding everything in and depression wasnt on me as much as i thought it would be
8840911 i think just to show that with hard work and dedication and faith you can get through anything
8840912 i can do all things through christ which strengthens me
8840913 the thing i like about wisconsin right now is were unique
8840914 five years ago when the spread first started coming into the league you needed preparation versus those teams
8840915 for us now wisconsin is unique you line up with a fullback and tailback and have some big ugly guys in front who come downhill its a different preparation
8840916 my mother always told me the ones who are the most patient are the ones who benefit the most
8840917 i dont feel like i beat him but i feel like ive earned the chance to play
8840918 i dont think hes gonna concentrate on being an african american quarterback out there
8840919 it was anything he wanted to get an opinion on
8840920 you dont have to be a genius to figure out clark was the guy that should have been developed into being the guy that would be the one
8840921 and i think devlin and cianciolo give them credit that they have really fought him
8840922 right now ive been so consumed with this fighting for the job so as of right now im just going to continue to work hard and keep doing my thing
8840923 i talked to my mom last night about all of it that was really hard ive talked to my dad a lot too its not like going to work in another u s city its halfway around the world in an entirely different culture without access to the people i love that have been such a huge part of my life
8840924 this isnt the first time this has ever happened to anybody
8840925 but that doesnt mean i cant miss him im going to of course im going to
8840926 weve been so used to driving 90 miles and see him play not only in champaign but at different places across the country
8840927 weve been able to attend 90 95 percent of the games before now after the nba draft we knew it might be an uphill struggle for him to prove himself to make a team and show he has the ability to be an elite player
8840928 but hes having an opportunity to play in a major league in israel and potentially prove to himself more than anyone else that hes deserving of playing at the next level
8840929 nba teams say they really like me my athleticism my feel for the game
8840930 one knock theyve had is from last year if my body can hold up the other is they want me to be aggressive and be a scorer teams would like to see that this year in israel will be good for me when they bring americans over they expect them to put points on the board maybe ive shied away from some of that in the past
8840931 from what ive heard the european fans and the fans in that town are wonderful
8840932 very rowdy obviously not as much as soccer but with the same loyalty to their team
8840933 theyd probably be sorely disappointed if they wanted to see me play right away
8840934 if you can win the sec championship odds are you can play for the national championship and that says a lot about the league
8840935 when people look at the pre season magazines there are a lot of people who say that a two loss sec team depending on what happens elsewhere in the country can compete for a national championship again
8840936 weve got more national championships we got more players in the pros so our talent level in this conference in the best in the country the quality of our coaches is the best in the country
8840937 most of the players want to play in the sec just because of the exposure and the level of competition each week
8840938 for the most part if a school from the sec does recruit a player heavily nine out of 10 times theyre going to get the guy because there is so much the sec has to offer its undeniable how many guys from the sec go on to the pros and that sparks interest in young players minds
8840939 the coaches in this league are one reason that makes the conference great
8840940 its been that way for years the great coaches want to coach at places where football is important where its a priority and fans are going to be supportive
8840941 its not only a three to four month passion for the fans its a 12 month process and thats the biggest thing there is nothing like going on the road and the enthusiasm and the way the teams get behind their teams on game day ive coached some other places in the country and there are a lot of great programs and conferences out there but there is just something special about southeastern conference football
8840942 were waiting to see what these guys can do to find out what were good at
8840943 were much improved but we still have to go out and play
8840944 there are two seniors and three sophomores out there and another sophomore thats going to play in the game as well tackle jonathan meldrum theyve come up through the ranks theyre determined im not afraid to say that
8840945 its a complete difference because at the beginning of the spring we didnt know what we were doing
8840946 for me its like going against four years of what ive been taught before but at the same time i cant make an excuse for myself
8840947 you gotta manage your time more you really gotta map your day out
8840948 i have study hours practice eat what i can go home its just about time management thats really it
8840949 the greatest rewards are waking up and not seeing your kids all day and coming home and its that smile and that does it for me
8840950 theyre happy to see me thats the biggest joy for me i aint seen them all day and i come home and its like they drawn in to me i cant live without them
8840951 my girls are older so they are more likely to watch tv and dora and hannah montana on the disney channel
8840952 when junior gets old enough me and him will go out into the field and throw the football around and play basketball but the girls theyre like their mama
8840953 during the offseason really you start getting them around the coaches and this and that meeting all the doctors and stuff in case we need a doctor for our kids they come around every now and then
8840954 man playing at kyle field man you be so pumped up my moment is say we playing at 2 30 pregame warm up be about 11 30 12 we can hear the drums beating outside getting ready to lead us out and you walk out and the first thing we see is the visitor side and the student section with their towels and we can see the top section over the zone and we walk out past the score board and see the fans and once you get to the bleachers all we can see right now is the corps and we run outta there and once you hit that and turn to your left man you be wired up out there
8840955 we go to other schools and their fans dont do nothing till they make a play
8840956 for example fresno state we had people dropping we were dropping the fans were dropping but they hung in there and we fought on together and we recuperated and everybody met at north gate it was a big deal
8840957 when we beat texas two years ago man you cant even explain it it was just like it was an early game too we beat them man when we got back when we got back to kyle field outside it was about five to ten thousand people out there it was crazy man hell yeah we gonna beat them again we gonna beat everyone this year
8840958 its gonna be a almost a tear dropping moment really being on top of it its a big accomplishment for me
8840959 its a god willing thing to score one touchdown you know i get the first touchdown i still have nine ten games left im gonna demolish the record and put it where nobody gets to it its a god willing thing to have 44 touchdowns coming into the season without god it wouldnt be possible
8840960 when a guys on the football field on the ground you hope he gets up
8840961 i think it goes back to the days of browns cornerback terry cousin
8840962 he doesnt get the respect that he deserves and when i was recruited i saw him play he passed the torch to me and i passed the torch to dunta robinson and he passed the torch to jonathan joseph and fred bennett
8840963 lito was their first round draft pick so the marketing department has to promote him as the guy
8840964 my first year i was really questioning myself it was very hard but every year gets easier
8840965 you dont know what to expect and you expend so much energy not knowing what to do or where to be the mental aspect is half the battle the players that play long prepare themselves week in week out
8840966 troy was a guy i tried to mold myself to play like him and steal from his technique and fundamentals and i think he deserves a lot of credit for why im so successful
8840967 ill go home and ill go to the games when i came into the league i stayed up with dunta robinson more but now im getting old and funky
8840968 those guys are from my area and if guys are coming from that area obviously im going to stay focused and make sure they do well
8840969 i was born and raised in south carolina and i never realized the dallas rivalry until i came to philly then some of your teammates may leave the eagles to play for dallas
8840970 its not weird because you understand the business i think ive been very fortunate to be with the same team for seven years
8840971 and i tell him that i learned from troy and i tell him to watch what i do and ask if he has questions
8840972 its tough but basically we tell him every time you play in a football game youre auditioning for 31 teams
8840973 if a guy has it and you see it you just keep encouraging him because hell play somewhere
8840974 ive always considered myself a passing quarterback and had to take on the label of an option quarterback
8840975 but at the end of the day i want to be a winning quarterback if i have to run the ball ill do it and if i have to throw the ball ill do that
8840976 nothings set in stone except that hes the starter in the first game
8840977 its going to help a lot i can definitely feel the difference
8840978 i feel like i can really cut on a dime and im a lot more precise with my movements now im not necessarily more flexible but it has definitely helped with my hip movements ive also been doing a lot more swimming trying to get my shoulders stronger i want to be a lot tougher to bring down this season
8840979 still has a long way to go hes a little too anxious and put too many balls on the ground the guy hasnt practiced but five times we just gotta get him reps and get him ready to go as the plan is to use him early and often
8840980 one or two runs i saw a lot of potential of the pressley i know
8840981 hes nowhere close to where i need him or where he should be he needs to be like someone who just got hired he needs to go over and beyond whats necessary to get where i want him he has every tool in his possession to do everything hes had those tools in reality he shouldnt be as far off as he is
8840982 weve had some very good practices weve had some that werent so good were making progress
8840983 i think weve made a lot of progress in this camp and hopefully we will continue to make progress in the season we are not a finished product we are a work in progress and will continue to be as we grow this football team
8840984 my whole thing is weve got to get better every day we prepare well and practice well and we take the game and win the game
8840985 i want to find out why they made the mistake
8840986 the biggest thing with me is just fixing mistakes in football thats all you do all game is fixing things
8840987 i want to make sure whats broke is fixed so we can move forward on things
8840988 we have a word for the day every day synergy was two days ago symbiotic was the other day coalesce was yesterday i try to put it in a sentence that goes with the team and its words that are on the grad board exam so i try to teach them something
8840989 i think if all you deal with is the football side of the player and they think thats all you care about thats not enough i want them to know i care about them every aspect of their lives every day we will have another word up there on the monitors theres always a quote of a day and a word of the day its educational thats part of the teacher in me i guess some guys use them and try to give me a hard time and ill use them again the synergy of us coming together and our whole being greater than the individual parts
8840990 im ready for thursday to come ive been waiting a long time for this
8840991 im excited ive had a lot of time to think about this and im just ready for it to come
8840992 but i didnt want to play tight end i think they had signed the quarterback they wanted in the 2005 class
8840993 i grew up in north carolina and was a big duke fan
8840994 my mom and all of my uncles went to duke
8840995 former duke coach roof and i became close as soon as i decided to sign my letter of intent to come here he gave me a call and told me congratulations
8840996 hes been very supportive ever since ive been down here
8840997 its been well documented what type of young man tommy is
8840998 i think that will help our team i hope it rubs off on the other players he certainly does have a chance to be a quarterback thats a leader because of the way he handles himself
8840999 tommys going to get a chance to go the distance
8841000 tommys earned the right to be the quarterback and hes going to have every opportunity to hang in there a long time i think hes ready to play and hes put in a lot of time to know our offense very well
8841001 he has the whole team behind him this summer when he stepped into the huddle and talked to the guys everybody listened beecher is the man and were rallying around him 100 percent i have no doubt he will show everybody what he can do
8841002 its a good feeling knowing that an all american like mckinley would say that about you
8841003 ive got complete confidence in them that theyll make plays for me and i hope that they have complete confidence that ill get the ball to them
8841004 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful and won a lot people expect you to be perfect
8841005 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we havent won a national championship its very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot and so part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8841006 at the end of the spain game where most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be and thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career at duke
8841007 so whatever you want to do whether it be the student newspaper local national media you can throw all that stuff out it aint going to work
8841008 but our team is going to have fun its going to be represented and were going to have an opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did
8841009 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8841010 for duke for me for our country for the kids i a better coach for them and a better person as a result and was while i was coaching
8841011 hus case is typical of the pattern of arrests and abuse in custody weve seen in the run up to the olympics
8841012 while the world was preparing to watch the opening ceremonies this man who was healthy in march was dying in his bed because of vicious treatment meted out by chinese police
8841013 this is a good development and has vindicated isans position share buy back has many benefits of giving investors more value for their investments we are willing to assist the government on its implementation because we have adequate information on how it can be done successfully given the experiences from other countries experts who came from all the world during that conference exposed us to how share buy back can be handled isan is willing to assist because the market must not be left to fall
8841014 as an emerging market we had quietly intervened by assisting some of the companies which accepted our calls shared their problems with us and today are doing fine
8841015 council was requested to note that in order to meet the gas requirement of the domestic economy particularly that of the power sector it is necessary for the nigerian gas company to embark on the project to expand the escravos lagos pipeline
8841016 we will not allow anyone to enter tatas plant on friday
8841017 it was a suicide attack the bomber rammed his vehicle into a security camp outside the tunnel
8841018 abie nathan loved life loved mankind and loved peace he painted israeli society with a unique shade of humanism and compassion
8841019 he held everybody accountable so there was no funny business
8841020 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8841021 its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8841022 a loud bang was heard by passengers and crew followed by the rapid depressurisation of the cabin
8841023 we will continue to assist the atsb to ensure that factors that may have contributed to the incident are understood and that any ultimately identified are implemented
8841024 he is not in the he is in a reserved room
8841025 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8841026 a farmer and a boy were killed in a claymore attack by the in olumadhu in nedunkerni on thursday
8841027 focusing on legislation in areas previously unexplored by the african american community including his call that a person of color be appointed to the icc
8841028 is broken and needs to unite for the common good of the african american community
8841029 the problem right now is that we dont have a unified agenda thats enforced back in the community and is clearly articulated everybody tends to be lone agents in these situations
8841030 the black caucus is from different tribes different walks of life i dont expect all of the whites to vote alike why is it that all of us should walk alike talk alike and vote alike i was chosen by my constituents to represent them and that is what i try to do
8841031 while everyone agrees that the hispanic population has grown they cannot expand by taking african american seats
8841032 an incumbent african american legislator with a 90 percent district may feel good about his reelection chances but we as a community would probably be better off if we had two african american legislators with 60 percent each
8841033 there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian the united states of america
8841034 w ere all on the liberal wing of the democratic party
8841035 a s you combine a strong african american base with progressive white and latino voters i think it is a recipe for success in the primary and in the general election
8841036 when you combine an energized african american voter base and effective coalition building with other progressive sectors of the population we think we have a recipe for victory
8841037 would you call shooting someone eight times at close range eager to please
8841038 working to block proposed legislation that would throw more juvenile offenders into the adult system
8841039 when white club owners along with israelis and russians dominated the ecstasy trade thats whom the cops were arresting
8841040 racial profiling may explain why incarceration rates are so high among young african americans law enforcement officials may be targeting blacks and other minorities as potential criminals and are using the vehicle code as a tool to stop and search them
8841041 it appears that official and public scrutiny of profiling behavior by police can lead to substantial reductions in arrests of minorities although this enforcement reduction may carry the unintended consequence of encouraging crime in minority areas

8841051 its odd if you look at vehicles and parts which have seen gains in both orders and production given the weak underlying sales number
8841052 it is conservatism that has been relatively consistent for the last six months or so but it is somewhat spreading
8841053 the thing that is making the stock go down is theyre starting to talk about demand destruction in western europe and in asia
8841054 up until this point the large tech companies like the ibms of the world have done pretty well in holding up their earnings because theyve had strong and consistent international demand
8841055 this shows international economies are slowing down and dell cited that specifically
8841056 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8841057 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin

8841065 for all its flaws gdp is relatively easy to define and verify
8841066 the first regular reporting of now popular statistics such as gross national domestic product gnp gdp unemployment and the consumer price index cpi began in the decade following world war ii modern political manipulation of the governments economic data began as soon as practicable thereafter with revisions to methodology often incorporating positive reporting biases
8841067 as for the bollard report all i can find are people citing it not the original got a link
8841068 sleepy thanks for the links i think that this might be the pces report from 2006
8841069 the bullying message to newspapers was unless we get favourable coverage we pull millions of dollars of advertising
8841070 i just think its silly and unsophisticated work by the institute
8841071 the statement made was that the national party that may well win the election would probably make changes that better suited the institute
8841072 its like measuring your income from a business without measuring your expenses wholly and entirely meaningless in the contexts that it is used these days

8841078 stefan marolachakis delivers each line as though it were part of a speech thats going to take a while to finish when he pauses you can almost hear him reaching for a glass of water and when marolachakis weaves his woozy croon through the beat youre making it come alive frequently lives up to its title on songs like the hustling partys over the end of the world creates an electric racket thats similar to pavements early singles its like someone accidentally recorded an expectedly intense performance in some basement in the middle of nowhere
8841079 given the over saturation of the brooklyn scene its as easy to overlook one fledging band as it is to over hype another hopefully this foursome will land somewhere in between as their debut album warrants a spot on those ones to watch for lists
8841080 and for a good three minutes the end of the world has us holding last cast slightly aloft taking it for a few well timed dips and across a steady bridge marolachakis elongated vowels gluing the whole thing together
8841081 youre making it come alive on chicagos flameshovel which continues to be the most exciting label in the city these days intrigues from the start when it becomes abundantly clear that the band is dedicated to being true to its instruments without much flash or layered overdubbing the sixties garage rock the group produces sounds precisely like a band playing in a garage

8841091 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8841092 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8841093 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8841094 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran by talking tough in washington

8841140 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8841141 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement

8841152 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio

8841168 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said

8841419 does anyone know where theres a bar around here you people are killing me youre killing me its all the same its all a bunch of boring crap
8841420 they will have to turn a crank or spin a wheel to get the pieces moving
8841421 ill be up there until the last minute putting things up
8841422 these events tend to make your inner feelings come to the surface whether you want them to or not
8841423 i feel they have an imprint of the individual who used it the memory is embedded in the object
8841424 i have to rely on found objects the object generally tells me what to do with it
8841425 when you get inside his work his boxes it is like crawling into another world
8841426 what has happened to me over the last couple of years is that ive become tired of doing the same old same old
8841427 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8841428 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8841429 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8841430 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8841431 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8841432 dans cette comp tition presque aussi f roce quentre hillary clinton et barack obama
8841433 this is a moment like when man first landed on the moon everyone who sees this will remember this their entire life
8841434 we have had eight years of going backwards president bush has been digging us into a hole and the challenge we face in 2008 is whether were going to continue to dig that hole whether were going to waddle in mediocrity or whether were going to go forward
8841435 he hit on everything the public needed to hear about his history many local republicans say he missed the target entirely
8841436 i dont think he made that great of a case today
8841437 take their leave of the saints far west on the building site of the lords house on the 26 th of april
8841438 gentlemen i presume there are men here who have heard corrill say that mormonism was true that joseph smith was a prophet and inspired of god i now call upon you john whitmer you say corrill is a moral and good man do you believe him when he says the book of mormon is true or when he says it is not true there are many things published that they say are true and again turn around and they are false
8841439 if the cap fits you wear it all i know is that you have published to the world that an angel did present those plates to joseph smith
8841440 i now say i handled those plates there were fine engravings on both sides
8841441 i could not read it in the original and i do not know either it i e the translation is true or not
8841442 yeah turley you should deny your faith and get out of the mormon church just like john corrill did hey you can write a book against the church like he is doing
8841443 one of the problems was that people were unable to pay their fines
8841444 it means that over the past two financial years we have spent r40 million here
8841445 the main effect will be felt tomorrow night and sunday when strong winds are expected
8841446 these winds will also co incide with a very high spring tide which peaks on sunday at 4pm and a sea swell in excess of seven metres which will be sitting offshore
8841447 could become a little water logged so motorists travelling in this area should take care
8841448 there is a deep low pressure system and strong westerly winds have already begun blowing west of cape town
8841449 the fetch the area stretching back to the source of the wind is very large also it looks like the direction and strength of the wind will be sustained
8841450 its only logical that the increase of exports in the motor and components industry sector have meant more production which obviously resulted in the creation of more jobs
8841451 large parts of this province are rural and depend on social services the government has to employ people to deliver these which also creates jobs
8841452 we should recognise it as a positive step especially when we measure it against the fact that the provincial economy has been growing without meaningful job creation
8841453 i had a bad feeling before going to bed at about midnight i heard a noise as if someone was jumping over the boundary wall i was surprised but i didnt go and check as the dog was not barking
8841454 if you dont make a noise we wont hurt you just do as we ask
8841455 i was so afraid i said to them they mustnt hurt my family
8841456 they asked me for the safe i told them i dont have one they took r1800 from my wallet then they searched for a safe when they realised that there was no safe they started taking other goods the computers jewellery camera video camera cellphones and our wedding rings
8841457 they heard my cellphone alerting me they took the phone and made a call within seconds a car came and they were gone
8841458 my daughter woke up during the robbery they tied her up with my wife before leaving
8841459 four men were involved they forced open a back security door the couple were watching television when the robbers broke in
8841460 i am excited linos and paulus will definitely strengthen our team
8841461 this is a very important start for the team and we are ready for the challenge bay united is a good side it wont be an easy match for us but we are hoping to play well
8841462 its worrying when someone makes a statement about something he doesnt understand
8841463 lobola is about building a relationship between two families its not only the husband that has to pay but the wife too has to contribute something to the husbands family
8841464 it is unfortunate that the contemporary arrangement is done by way of monetary value which has a tendency to distort the fundamental value that underpins this age old customary practice
8841465 we are open to any submissions that may be forwarded to the house of traditional leaders for consideration
8841466 i think lobola should be based on family circumstances if one of the families is poor there should be an adjustment made
8841467 if a man cannot afford to pay lobola then it means he cannot take care of his family
8841468 alhamdulillah akhirnya kebenaran itu terkuak juga doakan ya semoga masalahnya lekas selesai dan saya bisa bebas
8841469 ayo guk melu aku nang polsek ayo mas ikut saya ke polsek
8841470 saya enggak tahu apa apa mas katanya saya bawa sepeda motor asrori itu juga tidak benar
8841471 wis tenang ae engko nek wis metu tak kancani sampek elek sudah tenang saja kamu nanti kalau sudah bebas akan kuajak main main sampai puas
8841472 ya alhamdulillah kalau sekarang ada bukti anak saya tidak bersalah tapi kalau untuk menjenguk ke penjara belum bisa ongkosnya dari mana
8841473 polisi tentu mudah menangkap karena saat itu idul fitri dan yang dikunjungi pasti kakeknya yang di tuban atau di surabaya
8841474 yang jelas dia bukan asrori karena sesuai dna asrori dikubur di belakang rumah orangtua ryan
8841475 saya yakin itu asrori karena ada bekas luka kena knalpot kukunya rapi dan giginya juga jelas milik asrori
8841476 dia ngakunya tidak pernah membunuh sampai bersumpah jadi keluarga mempercayainya
8841477 terhadap hewan saja dia itu tidak tega memukul apalagi terhadap manusia membunuh lagi lebih lebih lagi asrori itu tetangganya sendiri
8841478 kalau keluar rumah misalnya ke tetangga pada malam hari selewat pukul 10 00 malam saja dia pasti akan minta diantar orang penakutnya seperti itu kok dituduh membunuh jelas kami tidak percaya
8841479 dia mengaku kepada kami saat di kepolisian tubuhnya dipukuli polisi sehingga terpaksa mengakui perbuatan yang sebenarnya tidak dilakukannya kasihan sekali dia
8841480 kalau mengingat kejadian dia ditangkap saya dan istri saya pasti menangis karena sedih saat itu sedang enak enak santai habis makan sahur menunggu datangnya imsak tiba tiba rumah kami didatangi beberapa polisi mereka membawa anak saya pergi
8841481 26 families lived here and at one point sent 225 children to the local school
8841482 four grist mills three cemeteries two churches two stores and two blacksmith shops
8841483 this is not one of gods creations intended for the eyes of our country men
8841484 i have stepped out upon this platform that i may see you and that you may see me and in the arrangement
8841485 george municipality has held indigent awareness campaigns throughout the community since the tariffs came into effect in july
8841486 many people with pre paid meters made contingency plans before the increase by buying electricity in bulk
8841487 we are making a plan with our bulk consumers allowing some payment flexibility
8841488 if the cost keeps on rising like that it can close businesses down
8841489 ran from a bullet in somalia only to find it here
8841490 abdul maalim who has been confined to a wheelchair has no recourse to state disability funding he has applied to move to canada as he fears for his life here at least abdul and abdirahaman maalim still have their lives the deceased who feared for his life in somalia lost his
8841491 the courts have made it clear that such offences will not be tolerated many people are from disadvantaged backgrounds but they do not turn to violent crime
8841492 i have to ask the question whats going to make it worthwhile for me to make a very good example of another cop corruption movie
8841493 we started saying to each other that the institutional lying at the center of
8841494 yet he reaches a moment where he says im going to distribute a disc with the pictures because they show a corruption of the things were supposed to be standing for for an actor thats an incredibly interesting tension
8841495 my dad retired from the nypd as a detective sergeant
8841496 my uncle was a cop my mothers father was a cop there are a lot of things we got right in the script including having cops talk as cops talk
8841497 but when edward got on board he was great about challenging me pushing me
8841498 edwards very involved in a positive way most actors are just concerned with the role he needs to know how his work fits into the piece as a whole he needs to understand the whole puzzle and how his character tentacles out into the other pieces
8841499 theyre all by sidney lumet for me the lumet movie that stands out from that bunch is serpico because that was the police corruption film for its generation frank serpico was the hippie cop who spoke to the counterculture
8841500 how words like pride and glory and patriotism are used to co opt my generation into participating in things that it knows are not right and when you frame something that way to me it starts to rise above genre
8841501 edward works like an investigative journalist or an archaeologist when he digs into a role he doesnt play ray as a cliche but as a compassionate troubled internally struggling guy
8841502 that was more the fun of seeing whether you could make a film that makes you feel the way those comics did when you were a kid as if youre entering a slightly illicit fantasy world
8841503 whenever i hear an actor say his character wouldnt do something i have to laugh
8841504 because for me when im working on a character and he starts to do contradictory things thats when i know were in the zone of truth
8841505 in the early days of the absa cape epic it was important to give context to the event by saying it was an eight day mountain bike race from knysna to cape town
8841506 but if we considered the race to start in a different location to knysna we could introduce even more exciting stages and routes to the race
8841507 we could ride in areas that had never been possible before due to the constraint of starting in knysna and getting to lourensford in eight days of riding since 2004 we have ridden a different route from knysna every year and most riders would say that it has got better every year albeit tougher but there are only so many different routes between knysna and lourensford
8841508 we believe that for the event to earn and live up to its title of truly being an epic race the route from knysna to cape town was most fitting
8841509 the stadium will have an eye catching unique roof structure and a spectacular view overlooking north end lake
8841510 but surely the most striking features were the images of the chinese performers moving as one drumming as one dancing as one sprinting in precise formations without ever stumbling or colliding
8841511 if asias success reopens the debate between individualism and collectivism
8841512 then its unlikely that the forces of individualism will sweep the field or even gain an edge the ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the american dream
8841513 each man has only to be left to utilize his own abilities and to exert his own strength to obtain what he wishes thus when a commodity is very cheap it invites a rise in price when it is very expensive it invites a reduction when each person works away at his own occupation and delights in his own business then like water flowing downwards goods will naturally flow forth ceaselessly day and night without having been summoned and the people will produce commodities without having been asked does this not tally with reason is it not a natural result
8841514 he castrated sima qian for daring to speak his mind
8841515 china treats them like horses but these horses do run
8841516 its a sign of the times people are on survival mode and are being very cautious its just the reality
8841517 we will join workers families and leaders from society in a march against crime
8841518 this initiative by percci business against crime and the nelson mandela bay municipality hopes for a good turnout to make a statement of zero tolerance for crime
8841519 i am looking for someone who has made a big difference in the community it does not have to be a high profile individual but someone who has touched a lot of peoples lives
8841520 it has to be someone who has taken from the game and given back a person who has been an excellent performer and an ambassador for the city
8841521 i will be reviewing all sorts of sports for the herald gm citizen of the year and i am prepared to research some of the nominees i may not be familiar with
8841522 i have come across schools where the buildings built to protect pupils pose a hazard to them
8841523 if the mind is not there we are fighting a losing battle
8841524 these days we parents are emotionally absent when it comes to our children
8841525 tonight i say to the american people across this great land enough
8841526 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8841527 of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8841528 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8841529 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
8841530 out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8841531 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8841532 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8841533 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8841534 passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8841535 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8841536 i am pointning fingers and laughing because you cant destroy me
8841537 you have to open your hands and let certain things go in order to get something else and perhaps more

8841543 i was on my way to the post office but as i approached slessors street five dogs pounced on me i was pulled down to the ground and badly bitten on my knees
8841544 the gate at the house was open and the owner was outside when suddenly all hell broke loose i screamed and used a basket to defend myself my employer came rushing to my rescue while the owner stood there saying i must not run away
8841545 we have made an appointment with the owner of the dogs for next week she is out of town
8841546 avinash was disturbed over the regular fights that his father used to have with his mother he blamed his neighbours for this and on tuesday night fired two three rounds on them
8841547 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8841548 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say 8 is enough
8841549 they started throwing stones at us and the women scratched us with their sharp nails
8841550 they tried to damage our camera but we managed to save it in the melee we received injuries on our heads face and stomach
8841551 we tried to raise an alarm for help but passers by were mute spectators perhaps they thought some film shooting was going on
8841552 the beggars must have thought the authorities would initiate action against them after watching the tv reports hence they attacked the scribes
8841553 her contribution to the struggle showed how she was a leader not only of the anc womens league but of the anc as a whole
8841554 she was one of the brave women from the eastern cape who went to the march alongside lily diedricks of port elizabeth and linah lukas of uitenhage
8841555 my mother was everything to my children and me i have come to peace with her death
8841556 the non aviation section will concentrate on the development of facilities such as restaurants and terminal buildings while the aviation development will focus on the runway and aviation equipment areas
8841557 certainly from a residential property perspective this will be extremely good news as this has always tended to be a holiday destination among second home buyers so the airport will make it much easier for holiday home owners to travel to and fro
8841558 many husbands working in johannesburg commute over weekends using the george airport this will prove even more convenient once the plett airport accommodates boeing 737s
8841559 white youth must choose sides now they must either fight on the side of the oppressed or be on the side of the oppressor
8841560 i know what youre thinking and the answer is yes

8841655 you dont learn anything if a trip goes really well but you learn a lot if you have to work through a lot of problems that you didnt expect
8841656 it was just a really really relaxing experience the whole time and it kind of added a lot more depth to what this community was like so instead of just looking at thinking these people need help you get to know the people and the way they live and it completely changes the way you look at the situation
8841657 unbelievable i keep pinching myself to make sure that i didnt just dream the fact that we won an olympic silver medal i have never cried tears of joy until today i cant even begin to describe what it felt like to clinch our medal and especially in the dramatic fashion with which it occurred
8841658 it was the mens teams and the womens teams that were more separated the womens team was quite accomplished one of the better handful of teams in new england and had been prominent nationally on occasion the mens team was not it was more of a club team with little structure and took kids directly out of phys ed classes straight to the team so its a big difference between now and then
8841659 to be competitive even a low national level you have to recruit so we endeavored on that i came from penn where recruiting was pretty crucial to the program and theres were the national champions while i was there so we just started recruiting and we still trained a lot of athletes on campus until the early 90s probably
8841660 it got me out of gym when i was in 7th grade so i signed for it
8841661 i didnt know what fencing was but i kind of wanted to get out of pe so i joined the fencing team and i didnt go to fencing practice but i also didnt go to pe and actually almost got kicked off the team for missing practice the coach sat me down and was like
8841662 well weve had a relationship with his high school and his high school coach riverdales martin schneider for quite a long time
8841663 weve had about five or six kids from his high school here so i always take a look at his better fencers at that school in riverdale and i was at that mamaroneck tournament and his coach mentioned him to me so i watched him and asked him if he would be interested i could see he was a good fencer you know were always on the lookout for good fencers were in no position to be selective at that point so were glad to have him he actually wanted to go to penn but penn didnt take him up on his offer so were lucky to get him
8841664 i was very cocky when i came to school initially
8841665 although i wasnt recruited but i felt could beat a lot of people my first year was actually humbling i didnt do very well and it made me rethink everything and kind of realize that you know continue to work hard but it was going to be a bigger challenge than i expected it was going to be in terms of my year i think i was very unpolished you know i was six foot two still but hadnt grown into my height so i was a little bit i was not as coordinated as i would become later on
8841666 he was still gangly as a freshman here and then as a sophomore he was not too strong he had mono his freshman year so that helped him set him back a little bit but he developed physically and became much stronger bigger you know its all between the ages of 18 and 22 roughly so maybe hes little bit late bloomer physically and he started training more i think he started fencing more often really putting more effort and he certainly became stronger you know on his used his axis more strategically right along
8841667 and i taught in new york and new york is where kind of a hub for state level fencing for the men so while i was teaching i was also training and you know i started to slowly like every year i moved up in the national ranking when i graduated from brandeis and each year i moved up about four or five spots and then in 2003 i think i was sixth in the country and i was within a shade of making the team and in 04 i trained i coached while i was doing it but for the most part i was training full time and you know i was fortunate enough to make my first team i finished fourth in 2004 from that year on i was making the world champion team every year
8841668 it was the first team i made even though i didnt get to compete in athens i went i saw everything you know when youre sitting on the bench you feel like youre almost in there you can really feel the intensity of it and i think that the reason why the team is able to fence so well at the olympics was because of a bad experience
8841669 france they were favored to win they have a very solid team up and down their line up
8841670 basically we beat hungary and russia to make the gold medal match and both of those are professional teams hungary was the world champion last year and we are i worked 30 hours a week the last two years so it was pretty remarkable
8841671 it was just one of the most amazing experiences in my life its like burned into my memory the emotion the feeling all of it and its something ill cherish and tell my children and grandkids about for the rest of my life just amazing to win a medal for your country seeing the american flag being raised and knowing that you were a part of that its a tremendous feeling
8841672 i havent decided yet if ill go on to london and try to make that team right now just trying to figure out for the next few months im going to take time and kind of enjoy the celebrations that go along with winning a medal and ill try to figure out what im going to do with my career and how fencing fits in but the short term plan is to continue fencing and see how long if it continues to work with my career and if i find i continue to enjoy it then i will obviously stay healthy and continue in the fall but if theres another path that lies ahead in education or something like that then i could see going that route as well well see time will tell at this point
8841673 people at brandeis have been so amazing to me ive gotten countless messages on facebook and from email from students from alumni from incoming freshman and i just want to thank everyone in the brandeis community for supporting me its been tremendous and im looking forward to bringing the silver medal to campus and letting everyone check it out and really sharing the dream with the brandeis community

8841687 you better know your roots cause you dont need a million bucks to have an ocean view ive been here long enough to see youre gonna need me soon
8841688 sing this song remind my children of the spots they miss remind them of their places
8841689 its in my rivers and in the valleys and in my ocean
8841690 its in my mountains and in the forest and in my sunset

8841692 son when everyones waiting nothing gets done www mp3lyrics org ngyw theres a time for the beers and the big screen tv but i dont think well have peace until people see theres a real world beyond our american dreams
8841693 the list includes fine food strange food everyday food and even some pretty bad food but a good omnivore should really try it all
8841694 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
8841695 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
8841696 give it to the president she chooses appointees that can help in running government agencies and of course the president saw that he has the capacity to fulfill his duties
8841697 its really exciting because the girls team didnt lose any seniors last year
8841698 and i can tell that everyone worked hard over the summer to come back stronger than ever
8841699 i feel like they already fit in with the other girls really well and they already know what is expected of them and have come back to school in great shape
8841700 we have much more depth and quality depth at that
8841701 all in all i think we will have a great season on both the girls and the guys side of the program
8841702 brandeis will definitely be a division iii powerhouse and a tough force to reckon with throughout the fall
8841703 everyone came back in great shape and we are a really tight knit team everyone is ready to run really fast this season and just like the freshmen ready to dedicate themselves to cross country and beyond
8841704 given our larger numbers we will have challenges in communication to overcome
8841705 but in general having numerous talented and hard working runners will be a boon for the program for years to come

8841708 i should like to take this opportunity to express my great confidence in and admiration for our union and its representatives
8841709 i anticipate leadership of the highest remark this coming year
8841710 we have everything in place to make sure the process moves smoothly
8841711 will be picked up by other members of the e board

8841717 even though we might be cutting something in half we really want ed to bolster everything for the student body
8841718 want s to encourage people to make this place the place to be
8841719 even greater flexibility to meet everyones different schedules lifestyles and food preferences
8841720 we will not interfere in the affairs of media she assured
8841721 we want to create a more sustainable campus with less bottled water by providing alternatives
8841722 is a great way to educate the community because it highlights how the decisions we make have big implications
8841723 take a leadership role on the issue of bottled water and other environmental issues
8841724 t he purchase of bottled water has crucial social environmental economic and health implications
8841725 the production transport and disposal of bottled water are wasteful energy intensive and polluting and on a national basis more than 85 percent of water bottles end up in landfills
8841726 this is one of the coolest things theyve done at brandeis so far i think people sometimes focus too much on the recycling aspect of the triangle instead of the more important aspects reducing and reusing and these water bottles do both
8841727 in short think it is long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do
8841728 my family and i came to this country as refugees to live the dream of a better life the opportunity that was given to me i took with both hands and for the past 33 years it has been an honour to serve as a police officer in a number of police forces and the met
8841729 when i started to break away from major labels and go out on my own the big thing the internet offered was a glorified mail order system it was better than what we had before it offered hope to people like me that they could get out from under the labels and start over on their own
8841730 i spend a lot of time on computers but im not a huge fan of what they provide
8841731 they have taken away from us in a way it has made available so much entertainment that people are constantly distracted facebook gave hope to everyone who ever owned a guitar and some kind of recording device their music is now available and fighting to get noticed along with everybody elses there are millions of singers and songwriters and bands and when there is too much choice my reaction is i dont know what to listen to so my choice is not to listen to anything
8841732 its a weird profession to have i might have to get another job if people dont pay to buy a record im not going to be able to pay to make a record my ego is not so huge that i have to put out records just to make records if it doesnt pay for itself you have to reconsider how youre doing things
8841733 im still living in the 80s in that respect i always loved records that had the gatefold sleeves and the more elaborate artwork
8841734 i had heard the early beatles before from my older brother but i thought this was somebody different the sgt pepper band
8841735 as a little kid that kind of thing is awesome
8841736 you cant say anything bad about john lennon but i have to say johns melodies werent always great and while mccartney is absolutely the standout musician in that group he probably shouldnt have been writing lyrics
8841737 would you do that to your family youve created a miserable situation on my street where i have lived happily for years
8841738 it definitely improves the safety of the children on the street
8841739 at some point i think we have to draw the line
8841740 i think we are trying our best to hear all sides
8841741 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency they needed a small victorious war
8841742 us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8841743 if everyone in the band isnt 100 percent into things you cant do anything with the music
8841744 is a culmination of all the time i spent writing
8841745 some of us have been going through some life changing stuff
8841746 we were too heavy to be an artsy band but we were too artsy to be a hard rock band there werent many bills we fit well on which was interesting and annoying
8841747 there was this shift into these soft songs and it came together really nicely
8841748 thank you for your interest in playing here but the entertainment here is much more mainstream than what youre doing
8841749 when it launches for the first time into the frigid canadian waters the diefenbreaker as it is almost certain to be nicknamed will be a crowning achievement for our country
8841750 we are hearing much greek wisdom this morning king said the priest
8841751 i have worked with akshay for eight years i really respect him for the way he has groomed himself he has become one of the biggest metrosexual stars most stylish fashion icon and he is so successful that i am proud of him just look from where he has come and where he has reached
8841752 i started designing for akshay in 1992 but i stopped working with him in 2000 because i had to move on also both of us needed to take a break from each other
8841753 i started 16 years back at that time the only opportunity i got was in bollywood i think it was good for me as it has created awareness about my brand i have met a lot of actors who want to wear clothes designed by me
8841754 the people i dress up are the best dressed they are really great with clothes they have a great body to carry off anything and they have a good style of their own
8841755 shilpa likes deeper and rich indian colours she likes to wear emerald she loves red and it really suits her even bipasha likes red katrina likes pastel and lighter shades
8841756 it is fun to work with actors and also challenging to make them look different every time it is also a challenge for them to get into a character every time with different clothes and looks a lot of hard work is required in bollywood
8841757 when i started fashion was not even taking off in a very big manner and i think it was after four to five years that i felt the need to do creative work for myself thats when i started doing clothes that were more wearable and saleable
8841758 i came at the right time for mainstream fashion luckily i have kept a very good balance between bollywood and mainstream fashion till now
8841759 we believe that so far as the actual world is concerned truth is the most important criterion whereas we tend to think that fiction describes a world we have to take as it is on trust even in the actual world however the principle of trust is as important as the principle of truth
8841760 visual computing is transforming the videogame industry transforming the film industry and has all kinds of potential for how we view real time television
8841761 we solve some of the most challenging problems for more and more companies around the world let the era of visual computing begin
8841762 three d should be a new way for us to dream and design the future of our world
8841763 it will impact everything we do education science talking to each other of course games
8841764 when you fly the actual mission you feel like you are in a simulator
8841765 we really cant do our job without the good visual graphics that we get
8841766 it used to be about the computing part but the emphasis is shifting it is not so much about the computation but how it is presented and seen by people
8841767 they will be able to recreate scan data so fast you could see your own heart beating
8841768 this is being subsidized by all these kids out there playing games
8841769 in other words pentecostalism remains first and foremost a spirituality a rhythm of rituals and practices prayers and altar calls
8841770 brandeis is fortunate to have president reinharz who is an inspirational leader and fundraiser and has been building wonderful connections to friends and alumni since 1994
8841771 what makes brandeis unique from other institutions is the money that is able to be raised from friends like the jewish community which has supported brandeis from the beginning
8841772 the difference is made up by many people who make generous but smaller gifts
8841773 its the largest form of communication alums have with brandeis and more alums respond to it than direct mailings
8841774 we believe that the transformation in the lives of brandeis students and alumni created by the scholarships is a compelling reason for alumni friends and parents to support this initiative
8841775 they have always carried these weapons so those arent new
8841776 we hope that there isnt a need to use any of those weapons but they are alternatives which would be used before firearms the firearms are not our plan b theyre the last letter of the alphabet
8841777 with brandeis police having guns it makes guns a part of our campus life
8841778 i like to think of brandeis as a safe zone where we can keep certain things away from our community but now guns are a part of it
8841779 i know that the officers are trained to only use the guns in situations when they feel their lives are at stake but violent situations can quickly escalate and become unclear accidents happen
8841780 its a perception thing most people when they see an officer will probably look at their guns right away especially at brandeis
8841781 i know that guns have a sort of stigma here but they are nothing to be afraid of its another tool towards increasing the safety not decreasing it
8841782 here we are 50 years later and were building the lake again
8841783 i applaud any project that will maintain the integrity of the lake and its use
8841784 this is where my work lives my research is on sex and sexuality
8841785 they had just said weve been doing a lot of work for a long time and wed like a staff member to help us see this stuff through
8841786 we came up with a smaller job description that would allow us to create a graduate opportunity and then working with some folks in the graduate world we put the word out
8841787 will push us to reach a higher plateau with having an inclusive community
8841788 its just the beginning the university is clearly in support of this initiative and dedicated to seeing it be effective
8841789 but it does mean a lot that we have her
8841790 im hoping this will go really well and itll be an example to the administration that we need more time
8841791 better is genuinely interested in how things are now and how things are changing and what that means for brandeis
8841792 i havent really thought about an agenda because my agenda is trisks agenda
8841793 i need to begin with everything thats on the table
8841794 she will be wonderful for those things pushing the administration in ways that we cant
8841795 the great thing about alison is that she will be a great advocate for cutting through the bureaucratic tape weve had to deal with in the past
8841796 having her there as an extra bounce for the extremely frustrating bureaucratic stuff allows us to focus more on the student body
8841797 her pure purpose is to be our advocate it lends us amazing amounts of power and influence
8841798 allows for a connection between trisk and res life that couldnt happen before
8841799 alison isnt just for trisk alison exists for our community
8841800 we all grapple with gender we all grapple with sexuality we all have bodies
8841801 her office is in the icc which is wonderful because trisk is really trying to open itself up especially in terms of diversity
8841802 wed like to become a bigger part of the icc
8841803 i look forward to a beautiful addition to the icc family
8841804 greater sense of being able to be yourself on campus
8841805 were working with director of budget in the department of students and enrollment frank urso to see how much money would go towards it
8841806 weve been working with athletics to decide on bids and weve been working separately with the administration to see how it will be funded
8841807 the final decision will be made with athletics regarding what the renovation will look like and how it will be financed
8841808 a conservative number because we built in 10 000 contingency into the systems project so that we know well have enough money
8841809 if frank is verifying that they have enough money they have enough money
8841810 as soon as the union signs off and releases the funds we can get it done pretty quickly
8841811 we should be able to get the weight room done with minimal interruption to use
8841812 i have worked with akshay for eight years i really respect him for the way he has groomed himself he has become one of the biggest metrosexual stars most stylish fashion icon and he is so successful that i am proud of him just look from where he has come and where he has reached

8841827 confirm or deny whether or not were engaged in an investigation
8841828 he is certainly the liberal leader whos taken his party furthest to the left at least since former prime minister pierre trudeau
8841829 i think this is not a time to go back to trudeau style economic policies
8841830 even if its true i dont think its a real recession there are job losses but overall employment is pretty stable
8841831 we will not only abide by the letter of the law but we will work with elections canada to reach a common understanding of the interpretation of the law and that is what we will follow
8841832 they can no longer hold themselves back from being who they are
8841833 constant lack of sincerity of this government which has its own very right wing orientations but wants to pass for moderate
8841834 the steady hand we need when the worlds economy is so uncertain
8841835 if youre at home or work and youve got to relax turn on
8841836 its probably not ideal we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8841837 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage
8841838 playing one day cricket there i know how hard it is but to play test cricket with the wickets and playing five day cricket its going to be extremely hard but its a challenge im looking forward to
8841839 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
8841840 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
8841841 since the employees and contract labourers had left the plant late last night so it was a conscious decision of the company that there would be no attendance at the project site at any of the three shifts today
8841842 were going by witness accounts that the cars were racing
8841843 surgeries and consultations would have been booked months before if patients cannot reach the hospital they miss treatment at the correct time cancer patients are the worst hit even chemotherapies have had to be postponed due to hartals on a hartal day we have send ambulances to bring doctors hoping that ambulances will be spared by the agitators the entire logistics of the hospital goes haywire
8841844 even a small scale trader who has only an investment of rs 5 000 cannot do business on a hartal day the government has the responsibility to ensure normal life people should get the confidence to venture out on a hartal day
8841845 we are forced to postpone many exams as students would not be able to reach the exam centres for want of transport facility
8841846 he is doing fine he is undergoing some checkups the doctors have told us that absolutely there is no cause for concern
8841847 i think i did okay he said after completing the race in about 17 minutes with the assistance of crutches a respectable time just over double the winners mark
8841848 i really gutsed it out today it was definitely a tough run probably the hardest i have run on the stairs so far mr mctaggart said
8841849 its not a bad way to go because you probably start off a bit easier than potentially what you would run you might have a little bit left at the end he said
8841850 i think i did okay he said after completing the race in about 17 minutes with the assistance of crutches a respectable time just over double the winners mark
8841851 bihar has highest flood vulnerability so its known that its flood prone but what has happened has taken all by surprise by the sheer magnitude
8841852 there are some gaps no doubt but we have done some good work also last year the biggest ever floods were in bihar only but casualties were much less of course there is heaps improvement required but at least now we are better prepared and its not what it used to be
8841853 for all intents and purposes theres not a whole lot we can do now
8841854 it really is sad because theres a lot of really smart guys out there who really dont enjoy their jobs anymore thats too bad
8841855 but the building of the car things we used to take a lot of pride in a lot of that is gone
8841856 mr hussein was allowed to survive his defeat as the result of a calculation we all had reason to deeply regret for the ensuing decade and still do
8841857 i am glad we actually have a budget to work from but i am disappointed the majority party has chosen to raise taxes rather than address spending reductions
8841858 in legislation the devil is in the details we will be analyzing the plan tonight thursday but at this point it does not appear to be something republicans can support
8841859 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8841860 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8841861 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8841862 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8841863 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened

8841865 children are most at risk from disease and suffer physical and mental distress from being moved from their homes to relief camps
8841866 we need more space to display the artefacts the asi will soon vacate the premises and then we will go for a massive expansion of the museum
8841867 we want the museum to be comparable to any other museum internationally
8841868 we have now got one permission from the ministry and are waiting for another one after that we would start construction
8841869 we know the national museum has been waiting for long for us to move we will move after the building is completed it will take at least two years
8841870 we have a collection of 200 000 objects but we are able to display only 10 percent of them we want to have construction under the ground this will allow us to have more space and would ensure that there would not be any structural changes that would mar the original design
8841871 we have many important collections and are eager to show them this would be possible when we are able to modernise the museum
8841872 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8841873 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8841874 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8841875 we will expand our line up of products with displays at 40 inches or larger as demand for them is on the rise

8842120 people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster
8842121 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8842122 we provide all of the local area network services to the division headquarters and support to all of the brigades
8842123 were also responsible for all of the local services such as microsoft exchange the portal ms sharepoint and name resolution for the internet
8842124 he basically holds the responsibility of the entire mission of the cic being able to collaborate all of their information and data on the portal
8842125 its a heck of a lot of responsibility for a specialist to have he is extremely sharp and as a matter of fact he is the system expert for the portal as numerous brigades come to him
8842126 we actually send him up to taji and hes been to some of the other forward operating bases to build up their portals to get them going and working correctly
8842127 he also trains up a lot of the civilian contractors that deal with sharepoint and brings them up to speed when they come into theater
8842128 basically what i do is make sure that the sharepoint is up and functioning
8842129 that way our units our subordinate units and their leaders can pass information with a good flow its a very critical job because of the emphasis of sharing information
8842130 without communications the division is dead in the water and we cant perform our mission in combat
8842131 we have to specifically lock down our network and consistently do scans to look for devices that are not authorized so we can keep this network secure and safe and to prevent people from bringing in viruses trojans and worms
8842132 its a consistent battle because you have people that dont fully comprehend or understand the value of this network and how valuable it is to the overall mission
8842133 its an ever growing field and everythings always getting better
8842134 as its getting better and more sophisticated we have to go out there and learn it so that we can provide tech support to people who are using the new software if we help people they dont mind helping us back and its a really good community

8842138 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half

8842140 the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8842141 we are reaching out to the community because the parents have not come to claim the child or family members
8842142 its shocking again its shocking if you dont want the baby than fine give it to someone else but make sure its taken care of dont just leave it in the middle of the street in the middle of nowhere
8842143 we havent ruled out anything we dont want happened to this child or the parents of this child or the family members we just dont know
8842144 we want you to know that your child is safe but the most important person that can raise that child would be you youre the most important person in the childs life and no matter what you think of yourself or what has happened to your life or your circumstances this baby needs you

8842152 if you look at sub saharan african markets theyve given annual returns that are substantially better than most around the world
8842153 even this year most of the economies around the world are not seeing very much growth 2 percent would look optimistic whereas in africa its been around 6 percent for years one of the fastest growing economies in the world is actually angola yet the perception is that its still in a state of war
8842154 a lot of the problems the u s economy is having you simply do not have that in africa
8842155 people are starting to see africa much more as the land of opportunity than in the traditional paradigm of starvation and famine and war
8842156 there are opportunities in a number of countries its not universal but its there

8842159 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8842160 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code

8842163 we are pleased to have this dispute with parlay resolved and look forward to working with other leading companies to assist in achieving compatibility with 1st technologys intellectual property
8842164 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy if this is confirmed we will have grounds to suspect that somebody in the u s has created this conflict to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the presidential candidates
8842165 as far as the perception of these events by the general public goes it depends not only on politicians but also on how artful they are in controlling the mass media and our american colleagues do this much better than we do and theres a lot we can learn from them
8842166 we didnt attack anyone we were attacked and therefore we need guarantees that we wont be attacked again and that our citizens wont be killed they are trying to present us as aggressors
8842167 on 7 august at 14 42 the georgian peacekeepers left the headquarters of the peacekeeping forces under the pretext that theyd received orders from their commanders to leave their posts and they never returned one hour later heavy artillery shelling began at 22 35 a massive bombardment of tsklhinval started at 22 50 the transfer of georgian ground troops started to the combat area at the same time georgian field hospitals were set up and at 23 30 the brigadeer general commanding the georgian peacekeeping forces announced that georgia has declared a war against south ossetia they announced this publicly looking straight into the tv cameras at that point we tried to contact the georgian leadership but everyone refused to talk to us at 12 45 am on the 8th of august the georgian commander repeated his statement so who attacked whom
8842168 for eight years while i was president i often heard one and the same question what place does russia think it should occupy in the world we are a peace loving state and want to co operate with all our neighbours and other states but if someone thinks they can just come in and kill us and that our place is in the cemetery these people should think of the consequences of such policies
8842169 those are the options that they are looking at where you can get good gate money and whether you go to australia or mt smart
8842170 all these things are important information for the viability of the teams
8842171 we would like to have our own franchise in the super series and also a test team in a series that would give you more depth of players and also allow us the retention of good players
8842172 at this point of time they sanzar have to make a decision around mid next year
8842173 for us and for tonga and fiji we are looking at exploring the viability of professional opportunities we need to give some options to the sanzar group
8842174 the meeting was held in a good spirit and we spoke openly about the issues
8842175 it was good to meet and discuss areas of concern and going forward we are now much clearer from both sides
8842176 weve made it very clear that our policy is not to recruit league players
8842177 thats because of the structure in terms of how were funding the clubs and the top end of the game
8842178 it would have to be an extraordinary situation for england manager martin johnson to come to us recommending a league player and for us to sign him
8842179 but if there was a player like that then its very likely that he would not already have been signed by a gloucester or bath
8842180 thats because these players are being shifted around the marketplace the whole time
8842181 we do get players who make mistakes in terms of where they move and when they move we have to deal with agents in the game now
8842182 were not in the same league as football but the agents are starting to have quite a big influence in where they see players going
8842183 as a union were in quite a difficult position to be advising players who are under contract to their clubs as to where they should or shouldnt go
8842184 players do ask for advice clearly those who are english and want to play for england
8842185 there is enormous desire for these guys coming through the system to play for england
8842186 i genuinely could not walk down a flight of stairs after games i was playing on one leg there was absolutely no way i could step off my left leg
8842187 i was honestly surprised i was getting selected for australia i think i was getting selected on reputation not form
8842188 i think players need to take far more ownership of their injuries and the management of them
8842189 i should have been resting my knee but i made myself available during the 2005 tri nations
8842190 at that time stirlo stirling mortlock got injured chris latham got injured and elton flatley suffered his head knock so they told me they needed me i knew my body wasnt right but i knew the team was struggling
8842191 i thought i would just have a bench spot and play a few minutes but i was starting every game
8842192 when you look at it if you are physically in good shape then you should be improving each season but that hasnt happened with my career
8842193 i never kicked on from my good debut season i know that when i am in good shape and fit i play well and i keep improving
8842194 every time i have not played well it has been because i have been carrying an injury
8842195 there is a lot of trial and error you try some things and they dont work others do
8842196 we need to win this match for south africa for the coaching staff and all involved with the springboks
8842197 one thing we dont want is to get together for the end of season tour to europe and still be asking ourselves questions about where we are and what were doing wrong
8842198 we want to convert our opportunities into points and improve our decision making
8842199 i know what these guys are capable of and what they can do on the field
8842200 i hope and pray that that breakthrough happens this weekend
8842201 the guys must simply accept the responsibility that goes with the rugby we want to play and thats making the right decisions and playing what is in front of them
8842202 the peter de villiers game plan is all about adding decision making to structure and we are stuck at the moment at decision making
8842203 but i back the players and i want them to keep going out and playing whats in front of them
8842204 the win will come because we have very good players
8842205 we dont have control over whether we win or lose and i treat winning or losing as the same
8842206 but we let the public down last week and we want them to feel part of a winning recipe
8842207 yes as a combination they are inexperienced and i realise the aussies will have them in their sights
8842208 but jongi and odwa are good players and im sure theyll be up to it weaknesses can change into strengths as easily as it can happen the other way round
8842209 ive been waiting all day just to see you and look now youre here and your fingers are very cold
8842210 i can see that so look youre getting all wet just standing there come give me a big hug ill take your coat

8842212 absolutely you get to be the first to try out my new tea set i think youll like it the woman said its an antique but i dont know it was a really exciting find though i wasnt really looking to buy anything just to look but its cast iron its called a tetsubin do you want to see it

8842214 you wont need all of that you dont need most all that i told you my family is very simple our way of living is simple you bring all of that and youll be the only one

8842216 listen you are the one i settle down with i shouldnt have asked you to come with me if i didnt want you you see otherwise im the silly one
8842217 thats right youre right i guess im just worried they wont like me theyll ask why is she the one and youll wonder too after a while anyway dont mind me ive just been getting the jitters the closer we get the flight leaves at 7 im just being silly i dont normally get nervous but im excited ill put the water on you just go get warmed up get relaxed then you can tell me all about it
8842218 thats true californias nice but the island is so beautiful i couldnt imagine ever wanting to leave
8842219 i admit i feel attracted to you i have thought to myself that maybe you will grow to like me back and have at one point even felt that the attraction is reciprocated its just an illusion
8842220 if all fails come back to cuisine because real emotion will reflect in the food
8842221 they dont jump over like frogs they will fly over like hornbills

8842232 we had 17 guys hurt at one time in springfield and we had guys playing that were banged up and hurt when you lose a first or second liner out of springfield even though you call up a first liner out of echl stockton its still a big drop from there
8842233 if theyre not playing well itll be a bloody merry go round between springfield and stockton

8842238 now that barack obamas self proclaimed celebration is over its time to take a long hard look at his record obama claims experience doesnt matter judgment does yet he clearly lacks both

8842256 it was all pre recorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8842257 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8842258 its nothing to do with priorities or which orchestra is better it was decided to split the work between the two orchestras
8842259 its quite a normal practice and if the olympics had been in melbourne the sydney symphony would have been involved im sure of that

8842264 saya malu bogor sebagai kota hujan dan green city tapi masyarakatnya kekeringan
8842265 kita lihat situasi dan kondisi sehari kami akan batasi sebanyak 6 000 liter
8842266 karena hal itu untuk sementara kami memberikan bantuan air dari tangki dulu proses pembuatan jaringan pipa baru tidak sebentar butuh waktu dua hingga tiga bulan selain itu membutuhkan dana yang tidak sedikit
8842267 di bogor ini tidak ada istilah kekeringan tapi curah hujannya saja yang rendah atau di bawah normal itulah mengapa dikatakan kekeringan
8842268 curah hujan di daerah tersebut di bawah normal yakni 15 persen di bawah rata rata
8842269 kalau dilihat dari sisi dermatologis semakin keluar daerahnya makin kering yakni bogor bagian utara itu
8842270 daerah caringin itu curah hujannya lebih tinggi dibanding daerah yang tadi saya sebutkan
8842271 sistem tata ruangnya tidak baik saat ini di daerah tersebut lahannya tandus dan terjadi penggundulan hutan hal itu sangat memengaruhi kekeringan

8842291 we can also confirm that we have been able to narrow down the number of customers affected by this breach to 10

8842301 a method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document such as one page regardless of whether the zoom is such that some all or one page is currently being viewed
8842302 in one implementation pressing a page down or page up keyboard key button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page
8842303 for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row

8842313 i didnt know it would stir up that much controversy
8842314 causing f a b some problems in other areas of his career
8842315 thats what made it look like it was an individualized effort to stop me
8842316 there might have been some things said out of spite
8842317 affected what their whole staff would be able to do promotionally
8842318 once they canceled my airplay it put a big halt to the movement
8842319 a very big part of why the hyphy shit stopped
8842320 the playlist suddenly shrunk we had to follow dictates that was a rude awakening with respect to the local stuff
8842321 if youre the peoples station why arent you playing the peoples music
8842322 everybody else is supporting their music but kmel isnt doing it
8842323 big vons stance was ill never forget him saying this this is my radio station
8842324 she was young she didnt know how to handle situations
8842325 at that point she knew she was not on the good side
8842326 you go into the back and its a whole different story behind closed doors was a lot of stuff going on
8842327 von gets the blame because he has allowed himself to be the go to person
8842328 for the records that we do play i could name 100 people thats still upset
8842329 his djs had to tell him it was a requested song von was holding out on the record
8842330 really didnt start playing him until after he passed away
8842331 stopped playing a lot of that hyphy stuff almost overnight
8842332 jazzy fought for bay area music i know that for a fact
8842333 i was coming back and giving money for records he never sold
8842334 i never just outright gave him dough and said play this record i should have though
8842335 if youre in the house thinking i take money i never took a dime
8842336 the kmel that played local music did so begrudgingly under pressure
8842337 everything has a shelf life theres only so much hyphy you can take
8842338 there is not a lot of hot stuff out there it all starts to sound the same everybody wanted to sound like f a b or sound like keak it got kinda stagnant
8842339 the culture that was developing was unfortunately not a healthy one
8842340 you can be a local artist and play up to where youre from but if every song is about where youre from theres a problem
8842341 pude haber hecho una mujer de esa mujer si hubiese sido necesario
8842342 fuck them im sure they all had kids so they should know what its like
8842343 reforming the band had never really been on the cards but somehow here it is
8842344 garry and i said if we are going to do it some time then why not now its our music so why should we not play it in whatever way we want
8842345 it was obvious alvin didnt enjoy playing with us any more ric chick and myself we love playing as a band and the fans wanted to see ten years after in concert joe was a lucky find hes a brilliant guitarist

8842348 john mccain ha votado con bush el 90 de las veces
8842349 estamos aqu porque amamos demasiado a este pa s como para intentar que los pr ximos cuatro a os no sean como los ocho ltimos
8842350 es el momento de cambiar ee uu y por eso me presento al cargo de presidente
8842351 mccain no es presidente indicado para este pa s porque su labor ser una extensi n de la pol tica que bush ha desarrollado en la casa blanca durante los ltimos ocho a os
8842352 la pol tica exterior de bush y mccain ha despilfarrado el legado construido por generaciones de americanos dem cratas y republicanos y nosotros nos disponemos a recomponer ese legado
8842353 mccain no se mofa de la situaci n actual de ee uu m s bien parece que no entiende la realidad que nos ha tocado vivir
8842354 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento de guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza

8842358 no importa la raza la procedencia si nos unimos el sue o am ricano ser uno
8842359 estados unidos debe luchar por ese sue o porque no hay vuelta atr s
8842360 todos estamos aqu para ofrecerle esperanza a esta pa s y apoyar a nuestro pr ximo presidente barack obama
8842361 overcoming attachment does not mean becoming cold and indifferent on the contrary it means learning to have relaxed control over our mind through understanding the real causes of happiness and fulfillment and this enables us to enjoy life more and suffer less

8842372 ce nest pas parce que john mccain sen moque cest parce que john mccain ne comprend pas

8842387 no me creo nada ni siquiera pienso en ello trato de hacer lo mejor posible mi trabajo
8842388 no tengo tiempo en describir los problemas actuales de am rica yo soy un cantante de rock pero ee uu necesita un cambio profundo y obama es el nico que puede arreglar el desaguisado de bush
8842389 and reflecting what has been a central theme of his campaign since he entered the race
8842390 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8842391 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8842392 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8842393 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8842394 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8842395 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8842396 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8842397 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8842398 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8842399 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8842400 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and will ask this country for a third
8842401 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8842402 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500
8842403 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8842404 theres this mob of white folks and theyre calling for blood
8842405 i thought shit its time to get out of here i tried to drive out of the area but i hit a red light on ladbroke grove i drove straight through
8842406 they were shouting abusive remarks at us such as why are you helping the black bastards you are a lot of nigger lovers a group of white youths shouted come on you fucking coppers if you want to fight a shower of bottles were thrown and smashed in the road in front of me
8842407 in one street where some of the ugliest fighting has taken place
8842408 your correspondent found a group of men in a public house singing ol man river and bye bye blackbird and punctuating the songs with vicious anti negro slogans the men said that their motto was keep britain white
8842409 just after a violent incident in which a coloured man was chased down a street by white youths
8842410 they shattered the whole concept of britain as the mother country
8842411 in a neighbourhood studded thickly with elegant villas and mansions
8842412 notting dale is a plague spot scarcely equalled for its insalubrity by any other in london
8842413 my dad was from shepherds bush my mum from notting hill
8842414 youd rob your own gas meter or cut off pieces of lino to shove in the meter until there was nothing left covering the floor
8842415 she helped bandage him her brother went mad and wouldnt talk to her for six months
8842416 right opposite my house were two knocking shops brothels and people didnt like it
8842417 one day three boys from nearby white city thought theyd do something and threw milk bottles at the windows
8842418 that the jews are the cause of the influx of coloured immigrants
8842419 there wasnt much difference between him and hitler he fucking hated everyone he hated foreigners wanted britain for the british
8842420 the riots started off with a false rumour that a black man had raped a white girl it was just fighting which grew bigger and everyone joined in we were bored
8842421 to think that britains history is one of only white working class racism towards black people is a nonsense race has been one of the key things in the whole of the history that makes britain great racism was at the heart of empire it was institutionalised by the ruling class
8842422 i sometimes feel like some masai village elder sitting outside my hut watching the new arrivals wondering if they know anything about what made this area what it is
8842423 now theyre our strongest allies ive got a black son in law and hes everything a husband and father should be
8842424 i went to a funeral the other day and they said youre always here i said its because im a notting hill lady and i show my respects there arent many of us left
8842425 our betting shops are gone theyve closed most of our caf s and pubs someone got very rich on notting hill
8842426 we are only as pure as the energy that we put forth in this world we are what we aspire to be and not what they who know nothing would have us be
8842427 therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make propitiation for the sins of the people for since he himself was tempted in that which he has suffered he is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted
8842428 in the hope of eternal life which god who cannot lie promised long ages ago
8842429 you are defined by your sense of honor and you are redeemed by your loyalty
8842430 afghanistan is lost for the united states and its allies to use kiplings term we are watching nato bleed to death on the afghan plains but what are we going to do there are 20 million pashtuns are we going to invade we dont have enough troops to even form a constabulary that would control the country the disaster occurred at the beginning the fools that run our country thought that a few hundreds cia officers and a few hundred special forces officers could take a country the size of texas and hold it were quite literally fools and now we are paying the price
8842431 we are closer to defeat in afghanistan than iraq at the moment
8842432 the first step in rethinking afghan strategy is to think seriously about the lessons of a recent opinion survey of ordinary taliban fighters commissioned by the toronto globe and mail
8842433 the security situation in afghanistan has reached crisis proportions the talibans ability to establish a presence throughout the country is now proven beyond doubt 54 per cent of afghanistans landmass hosts a permanent taliban presence primarily in southern afghanistan the taliban are the de facto governing authority in significant portions of territory in the south and east and are starting to control parts of the local economy and key infrastructure such as roads and energy supply the insurgency also exercises a significant amount of psychological control gaining more and more political legitimacy in the minds of the afghan people who have a long history of shifting alliances and regime change
8842434 its time to refocus our attention on the war we have to win in afghanistan
8842435 it is time to go after the al qaeda leadership where it actually exists
8842436 to somehow think that its an either or situation either afghanistan or iraq is a fundamental misreading of the situation in the middle east
8842437 what happens in iraq matters in afghanistan it matters in iran it matters in all the countries in the region
8842438 if we had pursued the policies vociferously advocated by senator obama we would have risked a wider war
8842439 surrender to al qaeda in iraq to fight them in afghanistan
8842440 belies a lack of a strategic understanding of the enemy we face
8842441 theory number one which is the obama theory is that terrorism is caused by grievances and that the solution is to deal with those grievances
8842442 the second theory mccains is that islamic violence is about a fight over resources morale and leadership
8842443 it holds that if you lose in iraq it will be a tremendous boost for the extremists and you will bring the neighboring countries under the sway of islamists
8842444 i dont have troops i can reach for brigades i can reach to send into afghanistan until i have a reduced requirement in iraq
8842445 afghanistan has been and remains an economy of force campaign
8842446 because of iraq we have fewer troops in afghanistan we have fewer intelligence assets we have less of a diplomatic focus
8842447 there is no easy answer but clearly pakistan needs to do more to crack down there
8842448 we need to coordinate civil sides of the effort which is critical in any counter insurgency effort
8842449 why even run if you dont really have a chance
8842450 we got an historic opportunity now you dont want to be what nader was to gore for us because thats gonna devastate us so much more in so many different types of ways
8842451 we are only as pure as the energy that we put forth in this world we are what we aspire to be and not what they who know nothing would have us be
8842452 if any one slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole people and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people
8842453 take no life which god hath sacred excpet by way of justice and law thus doth he command you that ye may learn wisdom
8842454 let there be no compulison in religion truth stands out clear from error whoever rejects evil and believes in god hath grasped the most trustworthy handhold that never breaks and god heareth and knoweth all things
8842455 jihad has been much abused to conjure up bizzare images of violent muslims forcing people to submit at the point of the sword this myth was perpetuated throughout the centuries of mistrust during and after the crusades unfortunately it survives to this day
8842456 i remember crying all the time my major thing growing up was i couldnt fit in because i was from everywhere i didnt have no buddies that i grew up with
8842457 leaving that school affected me so much i see that as the point where i got of track
8842458 hopes and dreams of using his talents to turn bad to good and become a pro black revolutionary
8842459 biggest influence to the youth since the great n w a
8842460 i never had shit growing up so i ad nothing to lose an i av no regrets
8842461 i aint scared of dying cos there has to be a place better than this in heaven
8842462 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8842463 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
8842464 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8842465 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
8842466 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
8842467 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming
8842468 but the pumping out of the water doesnt help my husband was a fisherman and he has seen how the water has gone over the years and with it the fishes
8842469 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
8842470 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here
8842471 this country has found itself through circumstances as the keeper of some of the most precious things in the world both made by man and by nature it has a responsibility to the rest of mankind to look after these things they are failing to do this here at the sea of galilee
8842472 justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8842473 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8842474 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8842475 she didnt hear the sound of anything falling in this room
8842476 si neuf dentre nous sont arr t s vous devez poursuivre le rassemblement ici sil vous pla t ne quittez pas government house
8842477 we were probably the only black people there other than those on the football and basketball teams
8842478 a mix of stuff from the 60s and 70s with electronics
8842479 her individualism and her honesty are what drew me to it
8842480 shes very much her own person and she sticks to her guns
8842481 so i loaded some tracks onto my ipod and we all went out
8842482 he was totally quiet and i was like oh he thinks its awful
8842483 is all me its my stories and my choice of producers and writers
8842484 i forget that i had a first record until people bring it up
8842485 i was 15 when i started working on it i wanted to do a reggae album and that came through in three or four songs but i also had a linda perry rock song an aaliyah esque timbaland song and a britney sounding neptunes song
8842486 at 15 saying i wanted to do a reggae album after growing up in a snazzy house in houston it was kind of random
8842487 i think i decided is an important record a grammy record and as a live performer shes spectacular you cant hate on it
8842488 they have to understand that i wouldnt do the same kind of stuff the pussycat dolls would
8842489 we want to move on and embrace every race in south africa
8842490 our figures show that 85 per cent of those wanting to join are black theyre fed up of corruption and the lack of support from the anc and want to join us in a non racial party which represents everyone not the few
8842491 were not going to be the party of p w botha we are going to be the party of f w de klerk who is still massively respected in south africa
8842492 the national party handed over a modern state to the anc in 1994 despite sanctions but now look at the country we need to tackle poverty from the ground up not with black empowerment deals which benefit the few
8842493 the majority black population will always associate them with apartheid and a sizeable proportion of the white population feel betrayed by them for negotiating with the anc to end apartheid i do not see them making waves
8842494 we want to be the underdog and are not bothered by the criticism we know what the feelings are on the ground
8842495 what happens to my money that is over the fdics insurance limits

8842725 but one of these opened its bosom and there came a black winged dragon flying out of it who said my brethren the metals are sleeping in there but i am always brisk and waking and will help you

8842832 in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran

8842834 there was a strong element of what miliband does best preaching democracy to new democracies which are more than converted to the principle while asking for little in return for his praise that would be awkward for them to give

8842836 a former british ambassador to tbilisi said that nato might have to send troops to the region
8842837 i think we shouldnt be too complacent or too scared in a situation like this
8842838 he suggested that a peacekeeping force made up of troops from the us britain france germany and russia should be sent to georgia to replace the russian units
8842839 to give up and surrender and say to the russians its your backyard youve won or to put men on the ground to protect georgias sovereignty and the east west oil and gas pipeline from the caspian and central asia
8842840 nato diplomatic sources said that no one within the alliance was speaking about sending troops
8842841 he said his defence officials had told him the provocation was to benefit one of the us presidential candidates
8842842 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8842843 and so it was that a team from the vice presidents office u s security officials and others were in georgia several days before the war began
8842844 u s deputy state department spokesman robert wood said the russians without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
8842845 an immediate concern expressed by all sides involved buffer zones outside of two georgian breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia
8842846 wood is of course wrong point 5 of the signed ceasefire agreement
8842847 russian forces must go back to positions they held prior to the outbreak of hostilities pending an international peace monitoring mechanism russian peacekeepers will take additional security measures

8842857 he claims to be the one that we have been waiting for and he can lower the seas and promise and deliver universal love simply by showing up
8842858 the polls are overestimating obama just as he is overestimating himself
8842859 obama ites are all over the place passing out volunteer cards
8842860 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8842861 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8842862 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8842863 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8842864 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8842865 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8842866 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8842867 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8842868 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968

8842873 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8842874 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8842875 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half

8842878 this team doesnt give up we played over 100 minutes of ball against a strong opponent

8842930 dont ask me this is all august and minervas stuff they needed more room for more stuff so i guess the old stuff had to get bumped down the ladder
8842931 i was but now that i see it happening i have my doubts everything out there was something i used to either save a life or exorcise a devil it just tugs at me these people just think theyre buying random crap and most dont care about what the story is behind any of it most of them will probably bring what they buy to be appraised hoping they found something worth more than what they paid for it
8842932 but think about what well be able to do now with the money we make here well be over the amount we need to get our hands on that ratty copy of the necronomicon youve been eying i have to admit even im curious about whats in it
8842933 you are right but it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth

8842939 is that politics seem to have little immediate effect on the man on the street
8842940 the whole thing boils down to a claim that it is
8842941 tom you are wrong you are not only wrong you are hurtful condescending and even pedantic
8842942 step forward now you soldier how shall i deal with you have you always turned the other cheek to my abode have you been true
8842943 it is because i love you and i will never stop loving you regardless of your sins
8842944 son that is where the devil let go of you and i caught you i carried you
8842945 son your choices was not always right and you had to learn i gave you freedom to do as you wanted and was hoping that you would learn from your choices
8842946 son that is the road that i had planned for you and which you choose not to walk for so long i was willing to lead you and show you all the riches that i had in my stores for you
8842947 son you started praying you started leaving the choices in my hands you started trusting me and you started believing in the power of what i can do i was hoping that you would come to me and look at my road
8842948 all it took was for you to start asking me for the things in your life that you wanted and trusting me enough with those things i am burning to release my full flood of riches onto you to give you far more than you could ever ask for or dream of you must remember that it was your choice to travel your own road i was always there but you never trusted me you never asked me to help you
8842949 you where the one that went of on the difficult road with all the dangers and my road was there all along
8842950 that was when you said to me that i must take control of your life and lead you according to what i your father has planned for you i was waiting so long for you to just start asking me for guidance i wanted to take your hand everyday but if you did not allow me and trust me i could not do that
8842951 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8842952 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8842953 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8842954 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8842955 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8842956 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8842957 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8842958 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8842959 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8842960 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8842961 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8842982 hiv is only articulated by ngos which are run by middle class healthy subjects hence the paranoia even with drug related hiv i found people who couldnt care less about their hiv status from a middle class mindset
8842983 the fear of and funding for hiv aids is caused by
8842984 a wealthy person can keep his or her surroundings clean
8842985 social individual or group this is why the disease has captured particularly sexual behaviour have been linked to the magnitude of funding received for prevention and research for instance the bush administrations earlier funding for aids had reserved a third of the money for programmes to discourage people from having premarital sex the red ribbon aids awareness clubs actually evolved into abstinence clubs promoting the message of no sex before marriage in schools and colleges the bush administration has had second thoughts about this part of its agenda in the amended bill that the president signed last week with more funding for hiv aids the important thing though is that one disease should not get visibility or funds at the cost of other diseases we need to look at the health of an individual holistically

8842996 im here on a trip for a few days and got bored
8842997 my boyfriend is being lame and wouldnt come w me
8842998 courage is not the absense of fear but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear
8842999 the big question this video raised in my mind though was
8843000 said leslie pierce and catching her husbands eye began to laugh as he chimed in
8843001 they taught me how to carry myself the value of a firm handshake how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them
8843002 we had a roof over our head we each had a bed and we had clothes to wear to church every sunday
8843003 i remember white people standing on the corners spitting and foaming at the mouth
8843004 but most things that influenced you as a child you carry through life
8843005 we had just brought in groceries from the pantry pride on stenton avenue my mother was putting the bags on the counter when i heard the news
8843006 and i remember the skies lighting up on columbia avenue during the riots
8843007 and the day after he was shot i huddled in a corner at school i was afraid that something might happen to us
8843008 every single day ive always had to work at this level
8843009 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8843010 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8843011 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8843012 tom cruise should have been more careful it is obvious that being the head of a company you have to delegate some tasks there are employees colleagues or co producers to which you assign things to
8843013 tom cruise being an actor in the film it was not his task to be at the set and to check personally whether all the security measures were taken but according to us law he can be held legally responsible for the security measures not having been in place
8843014 for the moment we communicated our realistic demand of 11 million this is going to be the basis of negotiations for now if the opposite side contacts us and we sit down to talk
8843015 a ministra dilma roussef foi a principal avalista da esp ria sociedade entre a petrobras e a multinacional white martins que criou a gemini uni o que um dos maiores crimes de lesa p tria da hist ria brasileira
8843016 foi fazendo uso deste direito que ela contratou sua pr pria s cia majorit ria a white martins para realizar todos os servi os necess rios ao desenvolvimento de suas atividades liquefa o log stica transporte e comercializa o d para imaginar o risco que corre o dinheiro p blico com o transporte do gnl feito pela white a pre os sigilosos

8843018 com toda a certeza pagar amos rios de dinheiro ao s cio estrangeiro e vamos fazer exatamente isto com a white martins a grande quest o que interesses levaram o governo lula a fazer isto

8843020 to cheat on your female partner with whom the male shares
8843021 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8843022 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8843023 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8843024 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8843025 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement
8843026 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8843027 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8843028 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
8843029 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
8843030 do something you love and youll never work another day of your life
8843031 they worked very hard on the new privacy protocol and something has come up that has thrown it into doubt
8843032 the lesson is that with enough genetic information its becoming easier to identify individuals even though their identities are presumed to be
8843033 our findings show a clear path for identifying whether specific individuals are within a study based on summary level data
8843034 never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way its been handled
8843035 has always taken into consideration national emergencies we are monitoring the situation very closely
8843036 at this juncture we are moving ahead with the planning of our convention and there have been no changes to our schedule of events we obviously share the concerns of many americans as we watch the developments
8843037 were not stepping up and solving the problems like we should were good at finger pointing and were good at talking about the way the world should be but were falling short on delivering those ideals
8843038 get motivated get excited get inspired and tomorrow we get to work to get him elected
8843039 im going to watch them and ill know what to do to win
8843040 hey ill just use photoshop to remove all these pesky little copyright identifiers on this picture whos gonna know
8843041 are you faint feeling dizzy please do not do anything strenuous and get to the hospital for admittance immediately

8843045 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8843046 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8843047 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8843048 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8843049 zardari has been advised to stay in a safe place and under the cover of official security
8843050 there are security problems associated with his movement because he cant move anywhere his normal activities are restricted to the prime ministers house to that extent it is correct
8843051 this all started because we asked our customers what they liked about our stores and what they didnt like
8843052 more cosmetic changes like changing signs and names are creative but dont address that more fundamental problem of competitive pricing
8843053 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8843054 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8843055 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8843056 the current of history meeting this new tide of hope
8843057 i was remembering the people who died to get where we are right now
8843058 people who gave their lives to be able to vote to be able to own a home to be able to live where they wanted to live all of that just came back and it brought tears to my eyes its a new day its a new day and im just so pleased
8843059 i always said whatever job you do do the best you can so i was good at picking cotton
8843060 but when i saw the white man weighing the cotton i said i got to get that position i was always looking to change things
8843061 critical information about the quality of peoples drinking water they should be warning the public
8843062 if your well does not meet standards you should have to put treatment on it
8843063 internal scientific interest a statistical presentation for the counties we havent had people asking for this type of stuff
8843064 its up to them to decide what level of activity to take
8843065 lets put it this way when people buy homes and you decide youre going to have your own well at home you ought to pay some attention to that
8843066 i dont believe any state in the nation makes individual domestic well compliance with contaminant levels part of state compliance
8843067 if there are more than 50 000 homes with problem wells they could all theoretically get on the phone today real estate deals could go down this could create problems and headaches
8843068 you would expect more from a state agency that is supposed to be protecting peoples health
8843069 may literally have no training this is not something you dump on the local level
8843070 if one guys well is contaminated its probable that another guys is
8843071 at a minimum written notice telling neighbors to sample their wells warning of a problem
8843072 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid
8843073 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8843074 the governments failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8843075 but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8843076 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8843077 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8843078 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8843079 it was not an elegant speech but that may have been on purpose
8843080 his attacks on mccain were pretty tough and thats the one element of his speech where he was in danger of conflicting with his brand
8843081 theres no question were going to need to do something
8843082 when you are part of a family that comes up with a concept sometimes youre the last to admit that it needs to be changed
8843083 thats just crazy maybe they should start calling it the 99 cents and up store
8843084 we try to keep our prices as low as possible
8843085 not based on having every single variety of every product out there
8843086 some relief on the 99 cent price point will provide more stability for their business
8843087 whats the point why not sell a standard size and price it accordingly
8843088 i want the same justice for every marine sailor soldier serving in harms way
8843089 you dont know what combat is until youre in combat
8843090 its an extraordinary situation and there just wasnt enough evidence
8843091 people heard the shots but nobody saw who did the shooting thats not enough
8843092 el principal objetivo de la monograf a es dar a conocer a los cl nicos dietistas nutri logos y especialistas de laboratorio las nuevas herramientas que hoy disponemos en el laboratorio para escoger siempre las m s tiles y adecuadas para cada paciente
8843093 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8843094 demanding market conditions have impacted on turnover and profitability in the first half of 2008 and conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of the year further rationalisation will be implemented to counteract the downturn with particular emphasis on cash management
8843095 the presumption of innocence has been derogated and reduced to a joke while my rights have been irrevocably prejudiced
8843096 no one was going to hire a 64 year old man for a good paying job
8843097 but the white guys who usually vote democratic but who sometimes stray over to the republicans we dont have them yet
8843098 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8843099 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8843100 because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from
8843101 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
8843102 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as
8843103 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8843104 so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8843105 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw coin play before so i didnt know what to expect
8843106 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8843107 i think i just had a lot more power than she did today
8843108 she plays a game where she hits a lot of high balls i think it would be effective against a lot of players but with my height and my reach it doesnt phase me as much i think that helped me
8843109 her deadpan conversational singing remained rough around the edges and at times phair didnt project enough to lift her voice above the instruments played by her and a three piece backing band which also seemed a bit out of practice
8843110 its kinda cool playing this old record even when i listen to it it takes me back
8843111 how many of you bought this record when it came out in 93
8843112 there are no immediate signs of an improvement in our markets
8843113 whats made milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me
8843114 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8843115 grow some balls guys and get this fan of yours out of jail we thought this was rock and roll
8843116 but we kind of thought its really tough for so many folks in this country i grew up on a farm and i have a lot of passion for farmers i know what they go through its just hard work every day you know of course the corporate farmers theyre doing good but the family farmers they cant make a living on a farm anymore
8843117 i dont know if anybody knows how to fix it just that we thought at least we can sing about it and maybe call attention to a few things
8843118 im humbly anticipating a game this week and thats it
8843119 i dont really know what to expect im very much looking forward to the game im ready
8843120 its a big game for us we need a win and im confident we can get one
8843121 hes been around a long time and knows what to expect
8843122 mark has done everything asked of him at training and deserves this chance
8843123 i think once hes back in top condition and form theres no reason why he couldnt be regarded as one of the best in the league
8843124 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8843125 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8843126 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
8843127 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
8843128 un riconoscimento unilaterale che non ha quadro di legalit internazionale alle spalle
8843129 il che non vuol dire che sia colpa del lavoratore ma che c insufficiente formazione e informazione
8843130 la formazione il vero articolo 18 la vera tutela dei lavoratori
8843131 nessuno si illuda nessuna legge puo dare la sicurezza del posto di lavoro non ce articolo 18 che protegga un lavoratore nel momento in cui unazienda o anche solo un reparto chiude
8843132 la transizione che viviamo ha aggiunto sacconi non ci consente di dare risposte immediate ci puo dare fiducia anche se nellimmediato non si percepisce il risultato
8843133 when you write dont worry about misspellings and grammatical errors thats what editors are for
8843134 the question is what part of no dont you understand the n or the o
8843135 like any action you guys pass you can do a motion to amend or rescind
8843136 at the end of the day we will pick a tax
8843137 im not sure that it has much chance of passing
8843138 its a better tax than to keep overloading the property owners
8843139 we do not see any further deterioration in the environment
8843140 i really like the way this team is responding to challenges
8843141 they want to hold it feel it see how heavy it is i guess
8843142 i met a woman yesterday who told me she watched the race with her 7 year old grandson that was kind of cool
8843143 there was an advertisement on craigslist for sex or massages things of that nature
8843144 the victim would call the number listed get directions showed up and some of them were robbed
8843145 were not positive all of the victims were showing up for sex
8843146 when we cut the budget we looked at things we had not yet allotted to the schools
8843147 that way we would not be taking people or things away from these schools that the principals already had in place
8843148 now we have equal performance so you could say were evening the playground
8843149 if were going to spend the money id like to see us get a result
8843150 we need to find out if were having an effect or running a day care service
8843151 we would project our enrollment to reach 72 000 after labor day
8843152 we got just the right amount of rainfall to fill them up
8843153 i couldnt have put in a requisition to get it any better
8843154 i hope that the justice department will raise some strenuous objections to this deal but the zero hour is upon us
8843155 when we announced our deal with yahoo we agreed to give the department of justice several months to review the deal before we began implementing it and we continue to cooperate with regulators as that process continues
8843156 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward
8843157 got no problem with them walking around naked at home but this is too much
8843158 once content has been identified as infringing veohs digital fingerprint technology also prevents the same infringing content from ever being uploaded again
8843159 all of this indicates that veoh has taken steps to reduce not foster the incidence of copyright infringement on its web site
8843160 when i found that out i was thoroughly disturbed and i was very determined to make sure they got back with us
8843161 with everything he had been through and having survived i thought he deserved something of a chance
8843162 lo har pronto poco a poco dame m s tiempo
8843163 hasta cu ndo hasta ma ana por qu no hoy
8843164 me llamaste a gritos y acabaste por vencer mi sordera
8843165 quien ama a cristo no puede tener miedo de encontrarse con l
8843166 if you take away my land you might as well take away my life
8843167 i never thought i was capable of this kind of hatred
8843168 but this is rejection of progress these kinds of protests
8843169 you may be rich but no matter how many times you say nano we say no no
8843170 why does a modern car plant need a thousand acres
8843171 we have just seen that year after year good stores leave the mall and we were sure it was going to happen again this time
8843172 i think that would have been just a terrible store to lose too
8843173 thats the best thing about this store that they have good popular clothes that dont cost a fortune
8843174 it was a big relief to hear they werent going to close honestly
8843175 did you just crack a joke rrm sorry to ask that question but after the surreal week in politics weve just experienced the world has taken on a dali ish slant and i believe its prudent to be assume nothing if so hahahahahahahahahaha
8843176 i have to accept his word unless i have evidence to the contrary
8843177 melihat kondisi tersebut kami tidak akan memberikan ijin kepada petambak karena arealnya telah jelas masuk wilayah cagar alam
8843178 sedangkan tambak yang masih produktif hanya berkisar 1 800 ha saja sisanya adalah telah ditelantarkan oleh pemiliknya
8843179 kami sedang melakukan inventarisasi tambak yang masih produktif dan yang berada di kawasan hutan
8843180 kakap putih memiliki nilai ekonomis tinggi sehingga dapat dikembangkan di areal tambak yang tidak produktif
8843181 shes made her mark with her career shes super talented shes an entertainer
8843182 my wife always says i wrote that book from the attic because i had kept all my research
8843183 im fascinated by organisations the way in which people relate to each other at work
8843184 of course it has been tremendously helpful to have had a bureaucratic life apart from the writing i dont think im the kind of writer who would do well sitting in a country cottage frankly
8843185 i long to question them about how their day is organised how they make their money what are the problems and so on
8843186 if i find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy the most probable explanation is that i was made for another world
8843187 is one of the only ways were going to be able to make progress
8843188 only if we insure the community benefits agreement cba is adhered to
8843189 there are more and more kids out there looking for new styles
8843190 diadora is more of an obscure brand that can be good because its perceived to be more exclusive
8843191 we know we cant compete with the nikes and adidases of the world from a marketing standpoint
8843192 were for that one kid who wants to set himself apart
8843193 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8843194 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8843195 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8843196 if they dont get on the train they are going to underperform all their benchmarks
8843197 state is a pretty good team they probably wont be one of the best teams well play
8843198 we believe these contracting changes along with other modifications help to clear up those possible misperceptions and ensure that discussion of our products continues to be focused on their clinical profiles and what is in the best interest of patients
8843199 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8843200 nothing more than the newest satellite in the google orbit
8843201 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong
8843202 yahoo has made it very very clear theyre going to take the best parts of their network and ours and combine them
8843203 google is not a good bellwether for how the economy goes as a whole
8843204 theres no question that the u s is in a slow period whether its a recession or not i dont really know we know europe has some structural problems google has a major presence in both
8843205 the income side of the economy with profits down for four straight quarters and employment falling looks like a recession
8843206 what you are seeing is more legitimate economic weakness in the income numbers
8843207 the gdi numbers raise the potential that gdp is overstating growth
8843208 im looking at the labor market and the gdp income numbers make more sense
8843209 it certainly did not feel like 3 3 percent growth
8843210 has done a better job recognizing the start of recessions than has the growth rate of real gdp
8843211 placing an increased focus on gdi may be useful in assessing the current state of the economy
8843212 hes the best i dont care what happened in his personal life hes still a great musician
8843213 to me hes always going to be the king of pop
8843214 hes had an amazing career and i think hes the best
8843215 but if he does it should be a soul album not a pop album
8843216 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8843217 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8843218 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8843219 people should be confident they have not been exposed to highly dangerous chemicals
8843220 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8843221 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8843222 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions

8843239 for me now is the time to put the feet up recharge the batteries and enjoy the moment the answer will come to me

8843292 though part of the expense of my training in germany was funded by the government the ioa refused to give me a ticket from germany to china

8843312 the attendance at a typical meeting is between eight to 14 people
8843313 the most rewarding part of one in teen for me is being able to reach out to the younger generation so that they know that they have a place they can go and be themselves with no worry of judgment
8843314 the way people can help out the organization is to volunteer their time volunteer as a sponsor or donate money
8843315 id like one in teen to grow as an organization and to hopefully get more people to attend and to be involved

8843326 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8843327 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time

8843336 dan berikanlah berita gembira kepada orang orang yang sabar yaitu orang orang yang apabila ditimpa musibah
8843337 mereka tidak minta diruqyah tidak pula berobat dengan besi panas dan mereka bertawakkal hanya kepada rabb mereka
8843338 bersabarlah kamu dan janganlah minta diruqyah serta berserah dirilah kepada allah dan berdoalah kepada nya karena ruqyah merupakan bentuk permintaan doa kepada allah
8843339 sesungguhnya jika allah mencintai suatu kaum maka dia akan menguji mereka
8843340 katakanlah sekali kali tidak akan menimpa kami melainkan apa yang telah ditetapkan allah bagi kami
8843341 sesungguhnya pemimpin kaum disengat kalajengking apakah di antara kalian ada yang bisa meruqyah

8843353 dan bahwasanya ada beberapa orang laki laki di antara manusia meminta perlindungan kepada beberapa laki laki di antara jin maka jin jin itu menambah bagi mereka dosa dan kesalahan
8843354 ketahuilah jika semua umat manusia bersatu padu untuk memberikan suatu kebaikan kepadamu niscaya mereka tidak dapat melakukannya kecuali dengan sesuatu yang telah ditulis oleh allah bagimu dan jika semua umat manusia bersatu padu untuk mencelakakanmu niscaya mereka tidak dapat mencelakakanmu kecuali dengan sesuatu yang telah ditulis oleh allah bagimu

8843360 under the circumstances russia had no other moral choice but to support appeals of south ossetian and abkhazian peoples on the recognition of their right for self determination in line with fundamental international documents
8843361 prima di tutti vennero a prendere gli zingari e fui contento perch rubacchiavano
8843362 prima di tutti vennero a prendere gli zingari e fui contento perch rubacchiavano
8843363 abkhazia and south ossetia have much stronger grounds for independence than kosovo
8843364 it is impossible to form an objective picture of what happened
8843365 georgia planned the action against south ossetia in advance the only thing they did not expect was that russia would react so forcefully
8843366 police have waited three days to begin their search which we think will start later this morning
8843367 it is expected to take several days to carry out the search because of the scale of the buildings and the extent of the devastation
8843368 there must have been at least three seats to this fire given the vast area it covered and the distances between the destroyed buildings
8843369 but until police begin their search we will not be any nearer to knowing whether mr foster and his family were inside their home at the time of the blaze
8843370 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8843371 scenes of crime officers have already carried out examinations at the various outhouses
8843372 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8843373 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers
8843374 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8843375 voters are indifferent to events abroad during u s elections
8843376 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
8843377 until recently we tried to help restore state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
8843378 this is the century long dream of the people of abkhazia made reality
8843379 this is a great day for our country and for our people
8843380 russia has saved us from genocide and has granted us the opportunity to develop and live on our own land

8843399 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8843400 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8843401 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8843402 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8843403 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8843405 im not a sex addict i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her there was another story claiming i was a neat freak
8843406 if i had to choose one of the two i think id rather be a sex addict its not funny and ill be glad when it goes away

8843425 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8843426 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8843427 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8843428 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8843429 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8843430 her last act of activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life
8843431 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8843432 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8843433 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8843434 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8843435 we would never have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis
8843436 they fought and triumphed in many battles beginning when they first bought a home together in san francisco in 1955
8843437 a great loss for me personally and for our entire community
8843438 laid the groundwork for all those who want a life of dignity
8843439 del and phyllis were a loving couple cherished by an entire community they inspired so many young and old
8843440 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it
8843441 for a kid just out of high school listening to them was a life altering experience
8843442 so fearless in every social movement political movement theres someone who transcends their time for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people del martin was one of those people
8843443 to unite as never before and face the grip that the extreme right wing holds over our country
8843444 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has suffered a devastating loss today with the passing of del martin who was one of our movements most courageous and extraordinary figures
8843445 del martin with phyllis lyon always at her side in a remarkable relationship that spanned more than five decades dreamed a world in which sexual orientation and gender identity and expression would be accorded full dignity and respect
8843446 del and phyllis were inspiration in action living openly and proudly as a loving couple long before many others felt safe to stand with them
8843447 del and phyllis have personally been an inspiration to me since i came out when i was 16 years old in my office a picture of the two of them looks over me as i work to carry on their work and their vision for living our lives in truth the national gay and lesbian task force will honor dels life by using our uncompromising voice and fighting for justice and equality a voice made louder and stronger by her 87 years of life thank you del for showing so many of us the way
8843448 you spoke the unspeakable you wrote the unthinkable you lived openly and proudly as a loving couple long before a movement would stand with you

8843452 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away many people believe in it
8843453 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8843454 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8843455 and just within three to four nights the acne on my face gradually and then totally disappeared

8843488 the most important thing he can do for the nation is get elected
8843489 he declared that he may not get there with us
8843490 and we are on our way to the promised land but we are not there yet and our next step is unity
8843491 let us be satisfied when our young men are going to college not going to jail
8843492 the only baton that were going to pass is from george bush to barack obama
8843493 were going to make sure that the names of african american voters dont mysteriously disappear
8843494 not this time we will not be divided not this time
8843495 we might quit at this point but we cant quit we cant let martin luther king and other civil rights leaders in the movement down
8843496 i challenge you to think about this moment not as a fulfillment of the dream but an important step along the way
8843497 i just wish my dad was here to see this
8843498 to have it occur on the 45th anniversary of the march on washington that it was destined to be it could have never been anyone else
8843499 my old friend jane pittman used to say that when a child is born folks look into its face and ask are you the one are you the one well he is definitely the one
8843500 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8843501 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8843502 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president
8843503 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8843504 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8843505 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8843506 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8843507 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8843508 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8843509 he did everything he needed to do he gracefully dissected john mccain and then set out his own vision and clearly everyone got it
8843510 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8843511 with profound gratitude i accept your nomination for president of the united states
8843512 america we are better than these 8 last years we are a better country than this
8843513 the same party that brought you 2 terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask you for a 3rd
8843514 suffering from a mental recession and a nation of whiners
8843515 pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you dont have boots youre on your own
8843516 we have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect the economy should reward drive and growth
8843517 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president change means that couldnt hear it doesnt reward the business who wrote it but the workers who deserve it
8843518 i will cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8843519 now is the time to end this addiction to foreign oil
8843520 as president i will invest in clean coal technologies and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8843521 an investment that will lead to new industries and pay well
8843522 america now is not the time for small plans now is the time to meet our moral obligation to provide every child with a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
8843523 if you commit to serving your community for your country we will ensure you can afford college
8843524 stop those companies from discriminating those who are sick those who need it most now is the time to help families with paid sick days and paid leave
8843525 now is the time to change bankruptcy laws to protect those with pensions
8843526 to provide guidance and love for their children individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that is the essence of americas promise
8843527 i stood up and opposed this war iraq knowing it would distract us from the real threats
8843528 you know john mccain says he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the caves where he lives
8843529 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and osama bin laden in afghanistan
8843530 these are the policies i will pursue and we can afford debating them with john mccain
8843531 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8843532 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8843533 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8843534 we dont agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing
8843535 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone you should run from
8843536 i realize that im not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8843537 its not about me its about you its about you for 18 long months you have stood up 1 by 1 and said enough to the politics of the past you have shown that the chang we need doesnt come from washington the change we need comes to washington
8843538 i believe that as hard as it will be the change is coming
8843539 republicans who never thought theyd pick up a democratic ballot but they did
8843540 you know this country of ours has more wealth than any other nation we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong
8843541 that promise is our greatest inheritance the promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in to bed the promise that led workers to picket lines and women to vote
8843542 america we cannot turn back not with so many children to educate not with an economy to fix america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone
8843543 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
8843544 live analysis of barack obamas acceptance speech at the dnc
8843545 intelligence reports said authorities and a number of well known public organizations in ukraine plan actions against the black sea fleets navigation and hydrographic support facilities
8843546 the purpose of this sub commission is to discuss any problems that might occur in a civilized manner decisions by local ukrainian judicial institutions have no legal power in relation to russian black sea fleet facilities and attempts by public movements and organizations to obstruct the operation of these facilities would cause extra tension in the region where the black sea fleet is located
8843547 its growing crackdown on chinese human rights activists in the name of harmony or social stability
8843548 vast censorship rules are in place in china and press attacks and harassment occur with impunity
8843549 but i kept seeing people id fought they were on tv with belts i thought if im going to do it im going to do it now since last year ive been fully dedicated to boxing
8843550 the thing is just to stay in reno everyone says to go to las vegas but reno is my home
8843551 im just trying to get my feet wet in the pro ring from what i hear from other pro fighters its a lot different than the amateurs and to prepare for the worst i have to work on being more defensive and not dropping my hands especially
8843552 i dont want to be old and say i couldve done it that that couldve been me
8843553 the decision was such an obvious mistake that lyle berman promised it would never happen again
8843554 theres this hazy line between government and the party the ruling party is basically doing its propaganda and its electoral campaign using government actions
8843555 the other thing is the party doing its campaign but of course they are mixing all of these and using public funds and public resources to conduct the campaign transportation all these resources
8843556 there is this unending saga with where the party ends and where the government begins
8843557 we are supposed to be selling ideas and programmes and then have people choose on that basis but if those in power are short on ideas but plenty on goods that has a potential to distort what we are trying to do here
8843558 clearly jornal de angola is working for mpla the state media is being overwhelmingly used to publicise mpla every time the television shows an event or rally by the opposition it will show the worst possible images while for the mpla its all very neat very composed very nice
8843559 its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
8843560 patterns of violence include sporadic assaults by local mpla supporters sometimes involving traditional authorities and local mpla leaders against local unita party members and their property and party symbols
8843561 obviously in the interior provinces there is still some fear out there
8843562 of course people interpret this in different ways will this be an earthquake in the country or within the mpla party
8843563 our message to people is people will vote on september 5 and life will continue the sun will rise just as it normally rises we will wait for the results to be announced and we will simply continue to live our lives waiting for the next election
8843564 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8843565 my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring
8843566 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8843567 all unhappiness and world wisdom leave outside those without smiles need not enter
8843568 i no longer pity the blind all the ugliness of life is shut away from them
8843569 everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific literary or artistic production of which he is the author
8843570 she came to our office while we were shooting a campaign and she stopped by the shoot we shot a couple of different looks on her but she is not the new face of ed hardy or christian audigier and we are not doing a swimwear line with her
8843571 theyre pulling numbers out of the ether and every number we get doesnt fit
8843572 i do think we need to get someone with more local experience and knowledge
8843573 my vision has changed for this city so drastically due to economic conditions out there i think well see a different picture
8843574 in my 30 years as a city planner i would typically factor in a three to four percent growth rate bear in mind that 2003 2005 was an historic blip that represents a tremendous change in your assumptions
8843575 in three months time everyone on the team made 10 to 95 pounds improvement in their lift
8843576 so overall we are stronger as a team than we were when we finished the season last year
8843577 but i think were better as a team than we were last year
8843578 i think our line is physically stronger than last year and thats a direct reflection on the bsf program
8843579 we have more depth at wide receiver than weve had the last couple of years
8843580 in our system hes not only in the backfield but also a receiver when we are in our one back set he looked really good in the scrimmage saturday against spanish springs
8843581 theyve been very active in both camp and the scrimmage you need defensive linemen who are active and make the offensive line adjust their blocking schemes
8843582 this could be the best linebacking corps weve had since ive been here
8843583 well probably take the three non league games to decide who all the starters will be once we get to league play
8843584 well just ignore these people and isolate ourselves and those terrorists will go away
8843585 to all our government officials since the oil producing nations the ones that sell us their oil at unheard of prices the ones that are making billions by bleeding our citizenry alive how about selling these same nations the food that they so desperately need from us at the same ungodly rate as they charge us for oil we can do without the oil much easier that they can do without food see just how fast the price of oil will drop when they get hungry
8843586 to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier
8843587 growing up all you hear is negative things about yourself
8843588 then you have this haven where you feel like youre safe and you feel like youre celebrated thats why we have so many successes coming out of whitesboro
8843589 this is a weekend to get together and renew old friendships
8843590 spirit of progressivism is not confined entirely to the caucasian race
8843591 you did what you wanted to do you lived where you wanted to live you bought your own home it was freedom
8843592 i am very proud of whitesboro it was a safe and happy place
8843593 a good boy a handsome boy he was like a son to me and played basketball in my backyard
8843594 if it werent for that town i wouldnt be where i am today
8843595 there was a high standard and an expectation to succeed
8843596 education is the key to unlock the golden door to freedom
8843597 it was you will go to school and you will do well
8843598 it was such a close knit family community if you misbehaved in school your parents knew about it by the time you got home
8843599 you cant walk into whitesboro talking about how youre this or youre that because you grew up with all these people
8843600 they know you they know your mother they know your father they pretty much can call it the way they see it
8843601 there was a time when we felt we were viewed as a town that wasnt going anywhere there was a need for us to prove we could do well
8843602 men jag kommer bara att skicka v ra soldater till farozoner med ett tydligt uppdrag och ett heligt l fte om att ge dem den utrustning de beh ver i strider och den v rd och de f rm ner de f rtj nar n r de kommer hem
8843603 under the decree recognizing independence of both republics which i have signed our country will help abkhazia and south ossetia to ensure their security and if they are attacked we will certainly offer them appropriate support
8843604 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
8843605 until recently we tried to help restore georgias state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
8843606 as to our involvement in other conflicts we naturally are not going to do this
8843607 however russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the entire length of its border this is absolutely clear
8843608 we do not know what to do with them the homeless
8843609 cry aloud do not hold back lift up your voice like a trumpet declare to my people their transgression to the house of jacob their sins
8843610 is not this the fast that i choose to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the straps of the yoke to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke
8843611 we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand that we should walk in them
8843612 christ gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works
8843613 let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven
8843614 whatever you do in word or deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
8843615 he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all
8843616 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those who are oppressed 19 to proclaim the year of the lords favor
8843617 cry aloud do not hold back lift up your voice like a trumpet declare to my people their transgression to the house of jacob their sins 2 yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their god they ask of me righteous judgments they delight to draw near to god
8843618 why have we fasted and you see it not why have we humbled ourselves and you take no knowledge of it
8843619 behold in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure and oppress all your workers
8843620 i see your business practices i see your attitudes on monday i see your merciless harsh oppressing ways of dealing with people at your work
8843621 behold you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high 5 is such the fast that i choose a day for a person to humble himself is it to bow down his head like a reed and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the lord
8843622 is not this the fast that i choose to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the straps of the yoke to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke 7 is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh
8843623 if you take away the yoke from your midst the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness 10 if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted
8843624 loose the bonds of wickedness undo the straps of the yoke let the oppressed go free break every yoke
8843625 is it not to share your bread with the hungry
8843626 is it not to bring the homeless poor into your house
8843627 is not this the fast i choose when you see the naked to cover him
8843628 take away the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness
8843629 then shall your light break forth like the dawn and your healing shall spring up speedily your righteousness shall go before you the glory of the lord shall be your rear guard 9 then you shall call and the lord will answer you shall cry and he will say here i am
8843630 then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday 11 and the lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong and you shall be like a watered garden like a spring of water whose waters do not fail 12 and your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt you shall raise up the foundations of many generations you shall be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of streets to dwell in
8843631 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio

8843660 come to me all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens maybe even backpacks lol and i will give you rest
8843661 the point of isaiah 58 is this piety that does not produce a passion for god exalting social justice and practical mercy is worthless or to put it positively god promises that we will break forth like the dawn if our piety produces a passion for social justice and practical mercy
8843662 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on his glorious throne
8843663 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me then they also will answer saying lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you then he will answer them saying truly i say to you as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me and these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life

8843669 guaranteed ride home or emergency ride home programs are designed to get commuters off the road and onto public transit or another method of transportation by helping assuage fears about how to get home in emergency circumstances
8843670 if you register for the program youll qualify for a set number of trips home per year often two to six if an emergency arises typically you call the guaranteed ride home coordinator and theyll call you a cab although in some programs you can skip that step and just call the cab yourself either filing for reimbursement later or using some sort of voucher some programs cover the tip some dont they may also cover the costs of a stop at your childs school or daycare on the way home

8843675 i was given the opportunity to sit down with a paiute spiritual leader mr clifford jake and he told me the story of the eagle
8843676 he said the eagle was once human and the most noble and courageous of all of the people who was asked by the great spirit to come and sit in counsel in heaven this noble and courageous individual said he could not sit in counsel in heaven because he could not fly so the great sprit turned him into an eagle and the eagle was given a calling to remain on earth by night to collect all of the prayers from the people of our nation and by day ride the currents of warm air rising up to heaven to deliver the prayers to the great spirit the eagle would then receive the blessings from the great spirit and bring them back to the people of our nation
8843677 its very fitting that so many people in southern utah who lost family members and friends to radiation related illnesses will release the eagle
8843678 knowing the story and tradition it will be a great honor and privilege for us to stand at the edge of the mountain and return this magnificent creature to the sky

8843745 when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8843746 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8843747 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8843748 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance
8843749 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8843750 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8843751 has been referred to in some quarters as a junior dave matthews band
8843752 no they dont no one knows about anything outside of napa they are just clueless about the world beyond
8843753 no you really dont understand do you napans dont appreciate this kind of magazine
8843754 yup it is well sigh sigh sigh exasperated sigh thaaaaaanks
8843755 some people have way too much time on their hands
8843756 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
8843757 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
8843758 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
8843759 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
8843760 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
8843761 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
8843762 everyone born after abortions legalization can consider their birth a personal invitation to take part in this great army
8843763 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
8843764 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
8843765 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
8843766 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
8843767 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
8843768 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
8843769 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
8843770 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come
8843771 it is a complete misinterpretation of scripture to find in joels army of locusts a militant victorious force attacking society and a non cooperating church to prepare the earth for christs millennial reign
8843772 through cain came all the smart educated people down to the antediluvian flood the intellectuals bible colleges
8843773 they know all their creeds but know nothing about god
8843774 a super race mentality toward the training of their children
8843775 today you can type joels army into a search engine and a thousand heresy hunter websites pop up decrying the very mention of it
8843776 this battle is not a game they joels army warriors will not be on the defense they will be on the offense and the gates of hell will not be able to hold up against them
8843777 those in this army will have his kind of power anyone who wants to harm them must die
8843778 we have always said and will continue to insist that kosovo is a special case which cannot be treated as a precedent for other conflict zones territories and regions
8843779 belgrade had never tried to use military force or cast doubt on peace talks from 1999 but they were thwarted by kosovo albanians supported by the west however it was tbilisi that undermined settlement mechanisms in south ossetia and abkhazia
8843780 stripped naked beaten and mistreated and that they had been subjected to too rough handling
8843781 manhandled during detention and tactical questioning the lack of significant physical injuries led him to conclude that the force used against each detainee was
8843782 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008 he said
8843783 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8843784 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8843785 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8843786 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8843787 we expected the u s to intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership
8843788 popyt w chinach nie jest zbyt silny poniewa gospodarka zwalnia i trwa sezon niskiej konsumpcji
8843789 a ver que yo me entere supuestamente mejor que la tecnolog a ptica o mejor
8843790 que idiotes decir esas pabadas que el mundo se va a acabar por windows vista
8843791 touchkit es un paquete de desarrollo open source tanto el software como el
8843792 pero si opino que cualquier celular podria tener mejor camara que el iphone
8843793 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8843794 my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring
8843795 the situation in egypt has become very dangerous having the satellite channels under the control of the authorities and media minister anas al fiqi all of whom oppose the principle of freedom of expression and compete among themselves to demolish citizens rights to independent media
8843796 this guy girl hit on me i said i was straight but not narrow and it was totally chill
8843797 to nie b dzie postawa skrajnie radykalna ale do radykalna 1 wrze nia w brukseli b dziemy mieli sytuacj akcji bo tam wszystko si mo e zdarzy zobaczymy co si da zdzia a na pewno b dziemy broni gruzji do upad ego
8843798 it builds up one person does it and another person does it
8843799 one time they took out 80 bags of trash and it never stayed clean
8843800 this year we felt like we needed to have a regular presence
8843801 so starting in april we did one big cleanup month and then we hired two interns
8843802 its definitely been a rewarding experience just in the fact that the amount of trash and graffiti has dwindled off so much with our presence there three days a week
8843803 its not the numbers of people that come here its the way the area is being treated
8843804 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8843805 ive lived in a state that has been blighted by racial discrimination
8843806 to me this is a momentous event for america and has the prospect of being a momentous event for the entire world
8843807 barack obama is not an african american nominee he is the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8843808 t hats what this struggle was all about to create one america one house and that is what barack obama represents
8843809 we must make the dream real we must make it real i think it will be real
8843810 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be howard dean chairman of the democratic
8843811 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8843812 and you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
8843813 my horse is out of the race im getting out to work for obama
8843814 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8843815 tonight tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8843816 i will listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8843817 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8843818 we will do this washington washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8843819 and in that time he has said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day that senator mccain took office
8843820 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8843821 as president as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8843822 now now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american
8843823 if you have health care if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
8843824 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations
8843825 and democrats democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength
8843826 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair
8843827 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8843828 and today today as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8843829 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8843830 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8843831 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
8843832 and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8843833 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8843834 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8843835 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8843836 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8843837 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8843838 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8843839 for 18 long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result
8843840 you know this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8843841 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8843842 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8843843 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred
8843844 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8843845 we cannot walk alone the preacher cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8843846 ive been flying back and forth to la pursuing my acting career if i fly back and forth twice a month thats like 250 000 round trip im back on american airlines now and im in coach
8843847 as an actor a lot of directors and producers dont want to deal with my entourage so im flying by myself
8843848 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
8843849 before i left for beijing i went to chicos and picked out my entire wardrobe for the trip
8843850 i knew i was going to need to be prepared for a variety of events activities and climates so i picked key pieces that i could mix and match dress up and dress down
8843851 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column so hes kind of in between
8843852 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
8843853 not advance the ball within the evangelical bloc of voters that mccain needs
8843854 it would make my job to rally the grass roots more difficult
8843855 i think romney would be very acceptable to the foreign policy conservatives and the economic conservatives and most social conservatives
8843856 but i think its fair to say that about 15 to 20 percent of evangelicals would have a difficult time voting for a mormon on either side of the ticket
8843857 it would mean at the margins there would be some evangelicals who just wouldnt vote
8843858 were talking about getting the word out to people about the fact that we dont want mitt romney as the candidate
8843859 there seems to be a groundswell of voices for mitt romney out there but i want to make sure the grass roots voices are heard
8843860 but am i concerned that there is a very important very hard working segment of traditional republican backers who might not work hard yeah that concerns me
8843861 now the beauty of it is coming out this is what the founding fathers wanted to come about
8843862 since she didnt win my second vote is for obama
8843863 we all have dreams i wanted to be here to join in its about unity
8843864 theres a lot of excitement throughout pennsylvania about this campaign our supporters are excited that barack obama is finally officially our nominee for president they want to get together to celebrate this
8843865 the supporters across the state did say lets get together there are more than 200 locations across the state ranging from a few people in somebodys home to lots of students on a college campus somewhere its definitely a historic speech
8843866 i think its everyones obligation to make the effort to come out
8843867 these are the worst conditions that the country has seen for a long time and together we can make it different
8843868 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8843869 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column so hes kind of in between
8843870 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
8843871 not advance the ball within the evangelical bloc of voters that mccain needs
8843872 it would make my job to rally the grass roots more difficult
8843873 i think romney would be very acceptable to the foreign policy conservatives and the economic conservatives and most social conservatives
8843874 but i think its fair to say that about 15 to 20 percent of evangelicals would have a difficult time voting for a mormon on either side of the ticket
8843875 it would mean at the margins there would be some evangelicals who just wouldnt vote
8843876 were talking about getting the word out to people about the fact that we dont want mitt romney as the candidate
8843877 there seems to be a groundswell of voices for mitt romney out there but i want to make sure the grass roots voices are heard
8843878 but am i concerned that there is a very important very hard working segment of traditional republican backers who might not work hard yeah that concerns me
8843879 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column so hes kind of in between
8843880 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
8843881 not advance the ball within the evangelical bloc of voters that mccain needs
8843882 it would make my job to rally the grass roots more difficult
8843883 i think romney would be very acceptable to the foreign policy conservatives and the economic conservatives and most social conservatives
8843884 but i think its fair to say that about 15 to 20 percent of evangelicals would have a difficult time voting for a mormon on either side of the ticket

8843887 there seems to be a groundswell of voices for mitt romney out there but i want to make sure the grass roots voices are heard
8843888 but am i concerned that there is a very important very hard working segment of traditional republican backers who might not work hard yeah that concerns me
8843889 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8843890 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8843891 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8843892 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8843893 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8843894 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8843895 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8843896 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8843897 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8843898 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8843899 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8843900 philadelphia is a good city in which to write american history
8843901 this is fitting ground on which to reaffirm the faith of our fathers to pledge ourselves to restore to the people a wider freedom to give to 1936 as the founders gave to 1776 an american way of life
8843902 clouds of suspicion tides of ill will and intolerance gather darkly in many places
8843903 a mysterious cycle in human events to some generations much is given of other generations much is expected this generation of americans has a rendezvous with destiny
8843904 we dont have the same kind of economic crisis as in the great depression
8843905 but we have a serious banking and financial crisis we have a war whether youre for it or against it that has gone on for five years longer than the second world war and you have a hunger for leadership
8843906 the dude was facing her on his knees like he was praying
8843907 she shared everything she brought food to people sometimes i would see her out playing dominos with her kids she had one person in her life that was her man
8843908 he was calm he was not the type to do this kind of thing
8843909 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8843910 said leslie pierce and catching her husbands eye began to laugh as he chimed in
8843911 they taught me how to carry myself the value of a firm handshake how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them
8843912 we had a roof over our head we each had a bed and we had clothes to wear to church every sunday
8843913 i remember white people standing on the corners spitting and foaming at the mouth
8843914 but most things that influenced you as a child you carry through life
8843915 we had just brought in groceries from the pantry pride on stenton avenue my mother was putting the bags on the counter when i heard the news
8843916 and i remember the skies lighting up on columbia avenue during the riots
8843917 and the day after he was shot i huddled in a corner at school i was afraid that something might happen to us
8843918 every single day ive always had to work at this level
8843919 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8843920 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8843921 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8843922 were just trying to keep people away from it until it can be cleaned up
8843923 we have not seen anything like this for the past two decades in terms of what avalon is experiencing
8843924 but finding one needle in an isolated incident is not what we would classify as medical waste wash up
8843925 we came down here to relax and entertain our family
8843926 it will be interesting to learn where this all came from
8843927 if someone is doing this on purpose it wont change how we feel about the shore weve been coming here our whole lives so its not going to color our opinion of the place
8843928 no existe en la carta magna ni en tratados internacionales el llamado derecho a la vida desde el momento de la concepci n
8843929 derecho a la vida desde el momento de la concepci n
8843930 la ley civil debe ser compatible con el estado social al margen de mis creencias religiosas como integrante del m s alto tribunal del pa s en una rep blica representativa democr tica y federal cuyos principios democr ticos reposan sobre la premisa de un estado laico no tengo por qu imponer mis convicciones personales a mis conciudadanos
8843931 est la protecci n a la vida y la salud del concebido
8843932 cuando tiene relaciones en el ejercicio de su sexualidad tiene que ser tambi n responsable

8843937 mark was my partner my best friend my soulmate and brought great joy to all who knew him
8843938 thank you to everyone for your kind words i request now that you let us grieve for him and please remember him with love
8843939 those entry level jobs that before someone with a high school diploma would be qualified for theyre being taken over by people with a bachelors or associates degree who cant get other jobs
8843940 now we need to very aggressively go after new employers
8843941 the gap between the skills that people have and what employers are looking for in entry level employees has widened over the years and continues to widen
8843942 i know this is going to help me do what i want to do in life
8843943 i have to start from the beginning so i can catch up
8843944 its kind of hard for people with a checkered history
8843945 ladies and gentlemen were in a no joke work world today
8843946 for those of us who are old enough this is not the 90s
8843947 even though its more difficult during these periods the skills that people gain are good for life
8843948 six months from now it will pick up its very cyclical
8843949 we hope this will refute all the rumors that say the american companies are the only ones benefiting from the american occupation
8843950 this action shows that every iraqi faces arrest and detention without any reason
8843951 our whole goal is to turn the 75 000 people here in this stadium into grassroots volunteers
8843952 this is all about neighbors talking to neighbors family members talking to family members
8843953 really only the office of the governor has the necessary power to make changes that are required to avert a serious fiscal crisis in our state
8843954 i am not content to sit on the sidelines while new jersey slides downhill
8843955 the one thing he and i would already agree on is that the next governor should come from mendham
8843956 a fancy term for the idea that we shouldnt eat the food our children will need in the future
8843957 i wanted to get you a present but i had no idea what to get you
8843958 i thought about getting you a present but decided not to because i didnt really feel like it
8843959 i obviously dont pay attention to you because i cant even find one stupid little thing that i think you would like
8843960 chunk was a big cat with a large bone structure he looked very fat but could carry his weight well
8843961 he only came up in the mid 20 pound range
8843962 hes going to live longer and its going to be easier to get the remaining weight off him
8843963 i own a 22 pounder and mine looks like a waify thing compared to chunk
8843964 but i cant imagine that the animal lost that much weight
8843965 we dont want to exploit or stress the cat out but we want chunk to continue to be our spokeskitty
8843966 and we were ready for a 44 pound cat hes only 22 youve seen the pictures can you imagine a cat twice that size
8843967 he is not in the he is in a reserved room
8843968 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8843969 you wont find anybody on jewelers row who will say a bad thing about him
8843970 but why are we only considering the role of the academic library as gateway archive and buyer i would argue this report needs to add a new dimension for faculty to consider the academic librarys role as learning center and instruction partner

8843973 tragedy is when i cut my finger comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die
8843974 everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific literary or artistic production of which he is the author
8843975 due to our clever coordination i anticipate that the wall between us will disappear
8843976 funnily enough i have never actually bought anything at vuitton but i probably will buy a party bag next week the best thing about such one off events is the chance to arrive at something new from the meeting together of two different spirits
8843977 i admire and worship her and its the kind of thing that i think is so wonderful to do at vuitton where its such an iconic brand and that monogram and everything and again ive said all this before but its so wonderful to have someone so outside of that thing take their look at it their approach to it
8843978 what kind of man is this even the winds and the waves obey him
8843979 this little light of mine im gonna let it shine
8843980 by that im assuming it means i get a party that isnt completely corrupt selling out its values to advance an amateurish poseur whose only interest in being president is being president and funneling our tax dollars into the pockets of his friends
8843981 i like the idea and i think in the future you wont need the parking
8843982 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
8843983 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
8843984 he that answers a matter before he hears it it is folly and shame unto him
8843985 we have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak
8843986 reckless words pierce like a sword but the tongue of the wise brings healing
8843987 like one who takes away a garment on a cold day is one who sings songs to a heavy heart
8843988 a soft answer turns away wrath but grievous words stir up anger
8843989 the heart of the wise teaches his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips
8843990 he who conceals his hatred has lying lips and whoever spreads slander is a fool
8843991 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
8843992 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
8843993 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
8843994 yesterday is history tomorow is mistery but today is a gift thats why they call it present

8843998 we cant meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century beauracracy that each one of us has andividual and moral responsibility to do our part with hard work and provide for each other and push change in washington
8843999 has no party or individual counrty that all americans are patriots we all put our counrty first
8844000 that last best home for those who hear the call of freedom
8844001 it would take too long to explain all the changes i have made i will present a lot of it to you in the ring

8844006 on saturday the two best heavyweight boxers will meet in the ring
8844007 but this time the ending will be different from their last meeting
8844008 you will see that john ruiz will be world champion again
8844009 its okay i was adopted is all my adopted parents were wonderful but i guess i still havent gotten over them not telling me until i was an adult and by then i already knew
8844010 but my parents didnt admit it until i was in my twenties we were a family
8844011 kit are you all right are you choking do you need the heimlich
8844012 im okay something went down the wrong pipe i guess
8844013 but its conservatism thats been relatively consistent for the last six months
8844014 this is a very significant dynamic in the server market today that i dont think wall street has caught up with
8844015 its correct that dell has focused on enterprise and consumer will follow in their priorities thats the right thing for them to do
8844016 nie dostrzegaj tej cz ci polskiej rzeczywisto ci o kt rej m wi zwi zkowcy
8844017 i see the olympics as swimming track and field weightlifting sports where the olympics is the pinnacle
8844018 for us the pinnacle is four times a year in the majors its the way its always been
8844019 if it didnt get in the way of anything else it would be great to hang out in the olympic village id be doing it more for that than actually playing the olympics
8844020 i cant tell you who won tennis at the last olympics
8844021 i dont think theres any place for golf in the olympics i didnt grow up looking to win an olympic medal i grew up trying to win a green jacket
8844022 whether we win or lose were going to be in the same position on the ladder so its more about us getting our processes right and certainly the style but more importantly we thought we turned the corner a little last week as far as form for some individuals and as a team wed like to keep that going
8844023 weve got a lot of respect for the adelaide football club they really are a good honest side who just work hard for each other and even if they werent playing for a home final you know youre going to get a great contest from them so its a great lead in for us for finals theres no doubt
8844024 i think in the belief factor were better i think after last seasons disappointment we had a fairly solid pre season and it was a matter of getting some wins on the board to cement some belief
8844025 there was a bit of anxiety amongst the group going in to round one but having a victory early i think was a catalyst for us to get a good roll on to the next seven or eight weeks
8844026 we want to see a response from last week with the way we went about our footy
8844027 we were very disappointed and we should be because the way we went about it after quarter time was so far away from the way we want to play the way we want to be perceived and our desired style of play
8844028 we need to correct that really quickly because it wont be anywhere near good enough in finals
8844029 to be part of his 300th game on the weekend will be awesome
8844030 i just hope we can reward him with a win
8844031 it would have been ideal for me to finish with the club playing good football but i guess thats football isnt it

8844039 staff should print black and white and on double sided paper
8844040 low and no fee sources such as job boards and employee referrals
8844041 what is the board doing to about improving our balance sheet
8844042 in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8844043 we are supposed to take drastic action against whosoever indulges in violence
8844044 while i firmly condemn every attack on human life whose sacredness required respect by all i express my spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in the faith who are so sorely tried
8844045 76 people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred 19 women 7 men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
8844046 martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
8844047 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
8844048 the people were very angry they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes we want our children we want our relatives can you give it to us you cannot so go away
8844049 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been damaged and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died most are women and children they the us military have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
8844050 these reports are being investigated and well look for the results of that investigation
8844051 coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
8844052 was aware of allegations that the engagement in shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian deaths
8844053 the afghan pakistan war is a two country war that cannot be won in afghanistan alone at this point in time us nato isaf afghan forces are simply too weak to deal with a multi faceted insurgency with a de facto sanctuary along the entire afghan pakistan border it seems likely that the afghan pakistan war will play out over a decade or more and be a major problem for the entire term of office for the next presidents of both the us and pakistan
8844054 the us and its allies have no choice other than to try and force pakistans new government to take a far firmer and aggressive stand decisions to take decisive action will be pakistani but the us should make it openly clear that the us cannot wait for pakistan to make such decisions and will have to treat pakistani territory as a combat zone if pakistan does not act
8844055 we thought opportunities were getting better for young indian women but the harassment only seems to be getting worse
8844056 the latest statistics are terrifying and it clearly points to male rage
8844057 underneath our incredible social change the indian male is experiencing nothing short of a psychological frenzy
8844058 i was never really taught how to act around a girl
8844059 when we were growing up girls were never sent to school usually they were married off right away
8844060 i liked being the breadwinner and king of my house but india is changing now my daughters in law work and think they can therefore be bosses and queens of the house some men find it a struggle we are trying to adjust to the new ways of girls venturing forth it may be better in the end since the women now earn money

8844092 the market outlook for talvivaaras main products nickel and zinc remains solid despite the downturn seen in their prices over the summer
8844093 the mine closures indicate that nickel prices in the range of 18 000 to 20 000 per tonne are at or below the marginal cost of production for many operations and can hence be seen as the likely floor price of nickel in the present demand environment
8844094 as talvivaaras estimated production costs are substantially below this range the company anticipates it would be able to operate profitably even during low points of the commodity price cycle
8844095 een doe het zelf boek om glamorous te worden want ik doe het ook allemaal zelf zonder visagiste of stiliste

8844097 je krijgt zo verschillende rokken in n rok je moet je niet meer afvragen doe ik nu een pliss rok aan of een rechte rok neen je doet ze allemaal aan
8844098 de schmink werd aangebracht met een soort verfborstel met daarop nog eens kleine borsteltjes
8844099 een beetje zoals een pastoor die ons met gewijd water zegende
8844100 ik hield mijn hart vast toen ik zag hoe de modellen hun kleren over hun hoofd uittrokken want retoucheren was niet mogelijk
8844101 het doet me plezier om zon sterke rijke collectie te zien
8844102 na onze eerste show heeft filip me een huwelijksaanzoek gedaan
8844103 ik heb vorige nacht maar twee uur geslapen maar je werkt zodanig intensief tegen de deadlines in dat het altijd weer spannend blijft elk seizoen weer het is niet omdat we al tien jaar bestaan dat het makkelijker wordt en als we dries mogen geloven is dat na twintig jaar niet anders morgen beginnen we gewoon de volgende collectie te tekenen
8844104 ik ben voor deze collectie niet van een verhaal vertrokken dat doe ik eigenlijk nooit ik heb me wel laten inspireren door enkele sleutelmomenten en woorden zijnde de art brut door het gebruik van tweed en uitgerafelde stukken daarnaast had ik zin om gedecoupeerde volumes uit de jaren 1940 te gebruiken
8844105 ik wou gedecoupeerde monolithische silhouetten tonen die laat ik contrasteren met flocqu van gebreide zijde ik hou van de manier waarop dat materiaal beweegt
8844106 dit wijst naar een felroze jasje waarvan de rug en voorpanden met een patroon van duizenden houten kraaltjes en de mouwen met geborduurde bloemen werden versierd is al snel een paar weken handwerk het is bijna couture ja we experimenteren en leren heel veel van elkaar je moet jezelf voor elke collectie blijven vernieuwen verwonderd blijven gelukkig ben ik in dat opzicht nog kinderlijk ik probeer ook telkens weer kleuren te gebruiken die je op het eerste gezicht afstoten maar van waaruit je een nieuwe soort schoonheid kan cree ren want als iets t mooi is wordt het al snel saai
8844107 oertraditionele stoffen als camel grijze flanel en alpaca hebben me geweldig ge nspireerd
8844108 daarnaast heb ik gewerkt met nylon een materiaal dat ik weghaal uit de casual sfeer en combineer met luxueuze materialen als zijde en kant ook met kant sla ik een andere weg in ik ontdoe het van dramatiek en maak er toegankelijke hedendaagse stukken mee die je overdag kan dragen ik toon leggings en broeken in bruine en zwarte skai in combinatie met lederen handschoenen en laarzen het spel tussen nep en echt tussen traditionele en hedendaagse materialen boeit me
8844109 over de beweging van de materialen we hebben stoffen laten ontwikkelen die vederlicht zijn en waarvan de haartjes bewegen wanneer je er mee stapt ziet er zwaar uit als bont maar het is zijde met losgeknipte draden die lichtheid en beweging zit ook in de drapages en de gebasculeerde vesten de kleren worden gecontrabalanceerd door iets sterks want de meisjes wij noemen ze demeulemeesterengelen staan op stevige boots met beide voeten op de grond
8844110 het was me om de spanning tussen sferen te doen tussen het re le en het irr ele
8844111 ive been thinking about this for a long time im not in the music industry any more im in the fashion industry
8844112 clothes are not important and im not changing society i am just doing my work as well as i can in the end i cannot forget what i do i make clothes its silly but its my job
8844113 een mengeling van vlaamse schilderijen en dan memling in het bijzonder en de rebelse amazones uit het begin van de vorige eeuw die hun korsetten afgooiden en bij wijze van statement in rijkostuum rondliepen het mannelijke van de stoffen wordt doorbroken door goud brokaat en grote pied de poulemotieven die referenties naar de geschiedenis vind je alleen in mijn eigen lijn in de collecties voor boss werk ik puur hedendaags en grafisch
8844114 45 minutes to go and still 13 girls to do
8844115 ik heb een creatieve geest en ik ben altijd op zoek naar nieuwe uitdagingen
8844116 ik haat het dat je moet aangeraakt worden door andere mensen
8844117 ik haat alle kinderen voor andere mensen is het super maar niet voor mij ik ben niet geboren als familiemens
8844118 als ze echt een expert zou zijn dan zouden haar ontwerpen veel meer indruk maken dan ze nu doen
8844119 alle bureaus en werkoppervlakken moet schoon en opgeruimd zijn er mogen geen fotos en kalenders aan de muren worden opgehangen en de lunch mag niet op kantoor worden gegeten
8844120 mijn favoriete outfit was de eerste waarmee je carrie ziet in de film het is een cr mekleurige jurk in jersey uit de jaren 70 en er zit een grote bloem op omdat het publiek zon belangrijke rol speelt bij satc wilde ik hen op deze manier warm welkom heten
8844121 hampton bays had echt nog geen gezicht het werd nog niet met een bepaalde persoon geassocieerd en het is nog een puur merk het heeft zichzelf nooit verloochend dat vind ik mooi
8844122 haar keuze van stoffen met een adembenemend showeffect het feit dat het model opkwam en meteen begon te strippen dat alles maakt berit de perfecte inzending om ons belgenlandje te vertegenwoordigen zij sprong er meteen uit als mijn persoonlijke favoriet
8844123 mijn mama komt vanavond kijken en zij is toch wel mijn belangrijkste publiek
8844124 oh my god antwerpen is een onmisbaar draadje in het weefsel van de modewereld

8844126 guillaume als je jezelf niet laat stuk maken door de liefde dan maak je jezelf stuk
8844127 belgi is niet alleen vlaanderen maar ook walloni een miss is er voor het hele land
8844128 als er dan toch een feestje gegeven moet worden dan geef ik liever de kans aan anderen om gezien te worden ik wilde niet zomaar een saaie receptie en ik wilde ook geen tentoonstelling van mijn eigen collectie dus besloot ik een tijdelijke tentoonstelling te houden in mijn kantoren sommige mensen uit de tentoonstelling ken ik al jaren anderen nog maar kort ze zijn stuk voor stuk getalenteerd maar vooral ook sympathiek iets wat ik behoorlijk belangrijk vind en tegenwoordig is iedereen bezig met een goed doel wel ik zie dit ook als goed doel jonge kunstenaars een platform geven
8844129 de gucci ervaring was verschrikkelijk 16 collecties maken per jaar en een heleboel onzinnige dingen cre ren waar ik geen moer om gaf zorgde voor een burn out
8844130 ik wil niet 75 jaar worden en enkel maar wat jurken en huizen hebben ontworpen
8844131 o my god stel je voor dat hier een webcam zou staan
8844132 in het algemeen waren de meisjes op de catwalks tijdens de afgelopen modeweken erg bleek en dun ze straalden geen levensvreugde en energie uit zoals de supermodellen dat vroeger wel deden
8844133 i believe that confidence is what makes a woman truly beautiful
8844134 and cosmetics are something that can make a woman feel special and give that luxury of confidence

8844155 armed vigilantes would become combatants and become targets of both the afp and the opposition group the milf moro islamic liberation front

8844159 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8844160 i just think he doesnt know its because john mccain doesnt get it
8844161 my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8844162 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
8844163 i havent changed my level of optimism around our business and demand levels and our ability to grow
8844164 the industry is still projecting double digit growth i still want to grow faster than the industry
8844165 i am more on a watch mode than drawing any conclusions at this point of time

8844170 het goeie aan haar is dat zowel mannen als vrouwen haar ongelooflijk aantrekkelijk fit en sexy vinden
8844171 these witnesses are all a bunch of criminals and liars
8844172 i am relieved to find that federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8844173 they worked together for six years on a daily basis
8844174 the first time she ever complained was when she was about to get fired this is a classic swearing match
8844175 if they cant agree on what happened how can a jury agree
8844176 i was shocked that judge kents conduct was not viewed more seriously and that he would be allowed to sit in judgment of others
8844177 hmm zou dit niet beter met die schoenen gaan en zou die handtas dan toch niet mooier bij die jas zijn
8844178 de defil s zijn niet meer wat ze geweest zijn toch
8844179 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind
8844180 im sick and this is why i had to come up some sort of explanation of what was happening in my body
8844181 i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor
8844182 ive been hiding who i am for so long i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
8844183 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
8844184 i know that i love him i know that much
8844185 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
8844186 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
8844187 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
8844188 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
8844189 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
8844190 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
8844191 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
8844192 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
8844193 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
8844194 worries about the credit crunch still exist and sentiment remains weak but much of the concern has probably already been reflected in the losses weve seen this month

8844199 we have to clutch at points of certainty and that is the tripoli agreement and the 1996 agreement and all other subsequent agreements that can be made as terms of reference
8844200 while at the same time we cannot proceed on the other side on the milf because we dont know what their position is
8844201 we begin by going back to the 1996 peace agreement i dont think well have a problem within the mnlf what were trying to do is complete the obligations for everyone and ensure compliance of everyone to the terms of the agreement
8844202 countenancing or non countenancing of atrocities committed by some of its members
8844203 our message to the milf is to surrender bravo and kato if they dont we will get them
8844204 we would like to say that there is no truth to that the mnlf remains to be a partner of the national government in the implementation of peace and development for many many years until today
8844205 there was no consultation with the mnlf we were not party to the talks we were not involved we are not opposed also to the peace efforts of the government
8844206 as to when finally there will be an agreement with government and the milf if it will work how it will work with the present agreement between the mnlf and the government ask the government because we have to harmonize if ever there will be an agreement

8844233 i think that would have been just a terrible store to lose too
8844234 thats the best thing about this store that they have good popular clothes that dont cost a fortune
8844235 it was a big relief to hear they werent going to close honestly
8844236 when we cut the budget we looked at things we had not yet allotted to the schools
8844237 that way we would not be taking people or things away from these schools that the principals already had in place
8844238 now we have equal performance so you could say were evening the playground
8844239 if were going to spend the money id like to see us get a result

8844244 it started out on a one on one basis and then in small groups of between eight and 12 and then on one occasion there was a large group of at least 60
8844245 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant but only one of them had the word accused next to their name
8844246 the allegations centre around the period of 1970 to the early 1980s so at this stage all the inquiries are at least over 20 years old
8844247 they got a group of between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on
8844248 id imagine it would be very hard for anyone thats subject to these sort of things to come forward
8844249 nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8844250 he said dont tell because a whole bunch of stuff is going to happen and theyre not going to believe you

8844253 what damage could be done to the mighty structures of the empire by one who gave caesar his due who scorned the bigotry which hated an infidel and punished the ungodly and who pictured a kingdom of freedom peace and love in which the distinction between friend and foe would lose all meaning yet with their unseeing eyes the romans had rightly perceived a radical and dangerous subversion with clearer intuition it seems than those who still characterize the preaching of jesus as spiritual and therefore not political what in fact could be more political a more complete and basal challenge to the kingdoms of this world to its generals and its lords both to those who hold power and to those who would seize it than one who says that his kingdom is not of this world and yet prays that the kingdom of his father will come and his will be done on earth this is an aspiration for the world more revolutionary a disturbance of the status quo more seismic an allegiance more disloyal a menace more intimidating than any program which simply meets force with force and matches loveless injustice with loveless vengeance here is a whole new ordering of human life as intolerable to insurrectionists as to oppressors it promises that forgiveness freedom love and self negation in all their feeble ineffectiveness will prove more powerful and creative than every system and every countersystem which subdivides the human race into rich and poor comrades and enemies insiders and outsiders allies and adversaries what could an earthly power so in love with power as to divinize it in the person of its emperor do with such dangerous powerlessness but capture and destroy it it could change everything were it not extinguished and speedily
8844254 st stanislaus has been co operating with the police completely and the principal informed parents of the allegations long before they came to the attention of the media father devitt said
8844255 sexual physical and mental abuse occurs in families and has been associated with all faiths and institutions
8844256 the catholic church has had a series of protocols in place since the clergy scandal broke in the 1990s the aim is to assist those who have experienced abuse to find healing
8844257 thousands of kids who attended st stanislaus during the time of the alleged assaults wouldnt have known anything was wrong
8844258 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8844259 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8844260 our risk management policies and practices were extensively examined by the nsw board of studies inspectors as recently as june 2008
8844261 i didnt have a clue these types of things were going on
8844262 i never heard any mention of it when i read the newspapers this morning i was shocked just dumbfounded
8844263 however i really feel for the victims of the abuse
8844264 i hope the offenders get the justice they deserve once all this comes out
8844265 the best thing about the school was the sport and the mateship i made lifelong friends
8844266 were going to do a little more for different crowds
8844267 our new philosophy is that we have to compete against all bands not just certain bands thats how it is now

8844269 i dont know if there are others out there but now that his name is out there for this they may come forward
8844270 i was embarrassed i didnt want to tell anybody i didnt want to have to be here doing this now talking about it
8844271 so you are testifying that you know what your sister said but you didnt tell your sister your mother or the investigator

8844273 the jury did a very good job at listening to different opinions and concerns
8844274 there was some doubt by some about the facts but in the spirit of compromise we kept going
8844275 made it difficult to look in the mirror in the morning
8844276 we dont know how it was split but i anticipate a significant number of those people were prepared to enter a serious verdict for our client
8844277 to have a jury here not return the same verdict with the same speed is affirming to our position
8844278 one lawsuit ought to be enough to teach a lesson
8844279 what he was trying to do was get the jury to take a look at the determination in the last case and consider that one here so they wouldnt do the same thing
8844280 that prejudiced us significantly we were at this point very happy to have a mistrial
8844281 if you give us a clean jury with facts that are fairly presented then our clients will be fairly and fully treated by this jury any jury
8844282 there was no intent by me to ignore the courts order
8844283 there was no thought of speaking in code to the jurors
8844284 i sincerely apologize to him that one chosen to be gods servant betrayed a sacred trust and so wounded him and other victims of abuse

8844289 dat het inderdaad vervelend werd nu er zo veel vrouwen begonnen te lopen dat er meer vraag was naar mooiere schoenen maar dat die er nu eenmaal niet waren omdat mannen die al langer liepen dat nooit belangrijk vonden

8844395 you often have to go outside your discipline to pioneer new areas of research and oklahoma has an advantage with so many experts in other fields but getting funding for interdisciplinary research is challenging however more capital and research infrastructure are needed for this device to become a reality as we build upon our existing capabilities oklahoma can become more widely known as a center of excellence in this important area
8844396 the science supports it and the dogs tell us there is something there
8844397 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
8844398 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8844399 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8844400 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
8844401 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
8844402 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
8844403 there are more motorcycles out children are not in school there are more people in cars traveling and in a relatively short time there are three holiday weekends

8844411 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8844412 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8844413 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8844414 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8844415 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8844416 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8844417 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression
8844418 the gunfire detonated explosives packed in the vehicle killing the suicide bomber
8844419 it is eu and us who can impose sanctions against russia but we should see that these sanctions will not isolate russia from the civilized world as the situation can further aggravate all over the world
8844420 first of all you appreciate how hard theyve worked all of them

8844422 practices mean just as much even more than preseason games sometimes
8844423 i have confidence in myself catching passes in a preseason game doesnt always tell the story of whether youre doing a good job
8844424 my coach used to tell me dont let your highs be too high and your lows be too low
8844425 youre going to have some bad plays youre going to have some bad days you just got to go out there and try to learn from your mistakes
8844426 thats the way you have to approach things you cant worry about anything else
8844427 it would give cricket a global audience and help stimulate our push into markets like china and north america
8844428 was seine anh nger an lincoln am meisten sch tzten war seine f higkeit in schwierigen zeiten hoffnung f r die zukunft zu machen
8844429 wir treffen uns in einem entscheidenden moment einem moment in dem sich unser land im krieg befindet unsere wirtschaft in aufruhr ist und das amerikanische versprechen wieder einmal bedroht ist
8844430 wir sind hier weil wir dieses land zu sehr lieben als das die kommenden vier jahre wie die letzten acht aussehen d rften
8844431 ich bin nicht der wahrscheinlichste kandidat f r ein solches amt
8844432 aber heute abend stehe ich vor ihnen weil sich berall in amerika etwas bewegt
8844433 mit dem heiligen schwur ihnen die ausr stung zu geben die sie in der schlacht brauchen sowie die versorgung und unterst tzung die sie verdienen wenn sie heimkehren

8844440 there are so many tentacles to this thing that you can be a part of that economic impact but it might not come directly from the nfl pipeline
8844441 the nfl is our client and were going to do whatever we can to make sure they are satisfied
8844442 its very important to take care of our client if everything works out when its all said and done and its a successful event then the opportunity for it to return is very high
8844443 were in the market waiting for the right timing its a matter of making sure we believe we are getting a fair price and were not paying more than we need to
8844444 maar ik zal onze troepen alleen aan gevaar blootstellen met een duidelijke missie en een heilige verplichting hen de uitrusting te geven die zij in de strijd nodig hebben en de zorg en beloning die zij verdienen als zij thuiskomen
8844445 wij kunnen het beter doen dan de afgelopen acht jaar
8844446 als opperbevelhebber zal ik nooit aarzelen deze natie te verdedigen
8844447 was trots geweest op barack obama trots op de partij die hem heeft genomineerd trots op het amerika dat hem zal kiezen
8844448 obviously you saw some other product probably silicon sealant grout is concrete
8844449 i saw a quote from one of your readers that points out a common misconception the reader spoke of hot humid days when heavier denser air is drawn down the chimney contrary to popular belief humid air is not heavier than dry air the opposite is true it actually weighs less we have this situation at times as well though more often in the fall and winter when we get large high pressure systems moving through our midwest location i imagine the candle situation to reverse the flow could work though the cause is not heavy humid air
8844450 unfortunately burning candles simply masks the symptoms and doesnt address the real issue with a stinky fireplace
8844451 there are commercial chimney deodorants that work pretty well and many people have good results with baking soda or even kitty litter set in the fireplace the real problem is the air being drawn down the chimney a symptom of overall pressure problems in the house some make up air should be introduced somewhere else in the house a tight sealing top mounted damper will also reduce this air flow coming down the chimney
8844452 last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8844453 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8844454 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you its about you
8844455 what happens from here on in wont matter i just had to be here
8844456 obama represents a down payment on the fulfillment of martins dream
8844457 this is the way that readers reviewers booksellers avoid foreign books by essentially diminishing their importance
8844458 see i have called by name bezalel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
8844459 and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom in understanding in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship 4
8844460 in cutting jewels for setting in carving wood and to work in all manner of workmanship
8844461 and i indeed i have appointed with him aholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan and i have put wisdom in the hearts of all who are gifted artisans that they may make all that i have commanded you 7
8844462 the table and its utensils the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils the altar of incense 9
8844463 the garments of ministry the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister as priests 11
8844464 you must be willing to sacrifice some of your pawns to win the game
8844465 a man who is not afraid to die can never be defeated
8844466 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it
8844467 we need a government that cares more about barney smith than smith barney
8844468 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8844469 there is a certain amount of information sharing among lenders we dont think we are being selected we are just being more transparent
8844470 it is important to stress that the 18 million bears no relation to the amount we expect to recoup
8844471 clearly given the turbulence in the banking and the housing markets the first six months have to say the least been very challenging to b amp b
8844472 it is important that we say the results are clearly disappointing to the board and like our shareholders we are disappointed to see the lack of statutory profits
8844473 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8844474 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8844475 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8844476 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8844477 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8844478 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio
8844479 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8844480 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this amp squo amp squo he told macquarie radio
8844481 stripped naked beaten and mistreated and that they had been subjected to too rough handling
8844482 manhandled during detention and tactical questioning the lack of significant physical injuries led him to conclude that the force used against each detainee was
8844483 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008 he said
8844484 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8844485 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8844486 i knew that there was a website or going to be a website about troy buswell
8844487 it didnt actually get brought to my attention that that was going to be a labor website
8844488 there are some elements of every campaign that could have been done better or not done at all and that was one of them
8844489 the people of wa want their politicians to be talking about the issues that matter not peripheral muckraking type stuff
8844490 im of the view that the treasurer definitely knew about it and on the balance of probabilities the premier would have as well
8844491 tata babu you may be rich but no matter how many times you say nano we say no no
8844492 it was an important step forward but we still have several barriers that have to be removed
8844493 what would you do if they wanted to destroy your holy place of worship
8844494 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8844495 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8844496 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something
8844497 i love the economy im gonna miss bush when bush gets out of office i dont know what were gonna do but im speakin for all repo men bush were gonna miss ya buddy
8844498 hey i found a little treasure for you today and ive left it at the counter collect it from the guy
8844499 two companies to follow the same principles to a different outcome
8844500 it makes sense to have a single standard but the transition is going to be difficult
8844501 its an immense project this will be like a full employment act for the accounting industry
8844502 simon property group put in roads sewer and water now we own the doughnut around them and our site is fully prepared to develop
8844503 well probably spend 150 million by the time were finished
8844504 doesnt he have any wife and kids he wants to get back to doesnt friday want to get laid
8844505 dude the storys over lets put a fork in it
8844506 ik had haar nog nooit zien spelen ze speelde anders dan ik had verwacht ze serveerde zeer goed en sloeg erg hard
8844507 ik voelde er niks van ik moet gewoon mijn uren gaan maken op de baan
8844508 obama will see a significant bump and we believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
8844509 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8844510 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8844511 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8844512 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8844513 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8844514 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8844515 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center
8844516 its the only sign weve missed all year and you only have to look for one thing
8844517 its going out there every game every win is crucial
8844518 all of a sudden you come into this scenario from where i was coming from
8844519 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8844520 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8844521 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
8844522 the quilts range from a george washington piece down to examples with nixon and clinton and there are a number of wonderful quilts in between
8844523 there are many people interested in political quilts or quilts that document a historical event
8844524 ive had quilts with the names of political candidates either a name written in or on a political bandanna or ribbon ive had several temperance quilts that had messages about the evils of drink
8844525 theyre very desirable and they always have been any time is a great time to have one but particularly in an election year
8844526 the donkey quilt is folk art its a feed sack political statement
8844527 they can be 1 000 they can be 30 000 or more it depends on the quilt and what it is you look at graphics age colors condition
8844528 im aware that we havent always met your expectations and id like to talk about how we could improve our performance
8844529 the choices we make in life bring upon a lot of sadness and a lot of hurt and a lot of pain
8844530 that moment you finally feel as if youve persevered youre so grateful for the color it added to your character i dont regret one single day
8844531 i just told him today youre the love of my life
8844532 ive kind of been texting him back and forth and hes doing great and lucy is doing great
8844533 im so thankful that my midwife and doctor paid such wonderful attention to me and the little ladies
8844534 and im really glad that i got to 36 weeks with multiples
8844535 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
8844536 clooney will play an unapologetic corporate downsizer whose untethered life is consumed by collecting air miles

8844539 als john mccain een debat wil hebben over wie het temperament en het oordeelsvermogen heeft om opperbevelhebber te zijn dan ben ik daar klaar voor want terwijl senator mccain zijn vizier op irak richtte nog maar een paar dagen na elf september stond ik op en keerde me tegen zijn oorlog john mccain vertelt graag dat hij bin laden zal vervolgen tot de poorten van de hel maar hij gaat niet eens naar de grot waar hij woont
8844540 ik weet niet wat voor leven john mccain denkt dat beroemdheden leiden maar dit was het mijne dit zijn mijn helden

8844545 it was quite an unusual dinner it was polite but you know
8844546 the wagons were circled and everyone who became involved or affected by this story opened up their arms with expertise strength love and sometimes cookies
8844547 because of this reaction my loved ones and i have not only survived the journey but we have thrived coming out of the darkness as stronger wiser and enlightened to the strengths of our community
8844548 im glad its over and i apologize to the family that are hurting and for ryan
8844549 he shouldnt be classified as a dangerous offender he should be classified as someone who needs help
8844550 there is no doubt in my mind about the truth of what i was told by her nor the accuracy of the details
8844551 she was a brilliant witness she not only survived the attack upon her but during the entirety of the attack she made efforts to pay attention and gather evidence
8844552 the accused was in possession of his faculties sufficiently to understand right from wrong
8844553 that hole would have taken a considerable period of time to dig
8844554 it appears one was on the outside of the escape plan that was the one that was caught almost immediately
8844555 they might have told management but they didnt share it with us staff arent happy about it its a huge risk
8844556 there are people who live very close people who have testified against these individuals who live less than a mile from the institution
8844557 deals with what is theologically termed the operation of grace that is to say the unmerited and unilateral act of love by which god continually calls souls to himself
8844558 every scene in the movie had the settings from the book but with a twisted heart
8844559 in waughs book religious commitments and social relations were part of a thickly detailed complicated and ancient lived reality t his is what makes brideshead revisited live and breathe as a novel none of it registers with any force in this lazy complacent film which takes the novels name in vain
8844560 its better to get ten men to do the work than to do the work of ten men
8844561 a person may be in a leadership position but if he isnt willing to delegate he isnt a leader at all he is a hired hand
8844562 what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet
8844563 we were looking forward to the trip to cancun but with the severe weather in the area we decided it best to keep our team and student athletes out of potential harms way
8844564 we are disappointed but it is the right thing to do and we were able to get a few great days of practice in and get the freshmen on the court for one day as well were all really looking forward for the 2008 09 season and will get a chance to travel internationally before next year begins

8844569 no news is made we know who the nominee is going to be and its just an infomercial yuk
8844570 we live in a democracy and the people must choose the government that will serve them every four years devote two hours to allow the democrats and republicans to lay out to the voters their unfiltered visions of leadership eight hours every four years then for three years and 365 days and 16 hours its all pundits all the time

8844590 well how about this youre invited to leave the house at 18 but you must leave the house by 21 is going be the rule
8844591 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8844592 you were blaming sara if darnell goes you kept on going on in your usual way grinding her down harping on about it
8844593 you cant take the fact that people like me that makes you a very pathetic man and i feel sorry for you honestly you should think about the things you say
8844594 i dont mean to be horrible youve called me selfish but i cook dinner for everyone every night and thats not a selfish person
8844595 here they are covering the process of selecting the president and nobody is covering the actual president
8844596 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8844597 what if they gave a cold war and nobody came
8844598 he went to new orleans and gulfport miss barely got covered
8844599 you have to know what you can say and what you cant say
8844600 you dont get enough information to write something its never enough
8844601 i know where the tomahawk is i know who took it i just need to know where to bring it
8844602 everybody who was involved and chris cooleys at the top i really appreciate all of it
8844603 they say having kids at my age either makes you or breaks you and im leaning heavily toward break right now
8844604 i couldnt believe what i was hearing that there would be a rebuilding of the toxteth street area with new properties built
8844605 i couldnt believe that a developer could remove me from where i was living against my wishes and build a new property
8844606 judged on community benefits environmental impact and cost rehabilitation and refurbishment is clearly the way forward
8844607 there is something about terraced houses that make them a successful model for housing they can accommodate different types of people and different types of lifestyles and these particular terraces in east manchester are full of character
8844608 there is nothing wrong with terraced properties except the sheer quantity of them and they are very very low value in the current market place these properties are not even getting their reserve prices at auction
8844609 they are the lowest value housing stock in the market place and we are replacing them with 430 family homes with gardens and driveways which is giving a different sort of offer
8844610 they are incredibly tight but you can make them work i think it just takes a little but of imagination to think about how we work with these houses to breathe some new life into them
8844611 the area that i came to initially has now largely disappeared
8844612 i think that given the opportunity the people who have been shifted out of the toxteth street area would come back and thats what i hope
8844613 there is no possible way that i would live ever in a community that they are trying to construct out of a computer
8844614 we started off really wanting to make a point that demolition is insane because on every level it doesnt make sense
8844615 but weve got a situation now where we feel that this is a viable alternative and in fact a preferable alternative
8844616 the beauty of these kind of designs is that there are many of these terraces not just in manchester but all over the country and with slight modifications these kind of refurbishment proposals can be applied to different areas
8844617 this years city of sydney business awards saw an enormous number of entries as well as a record number of attendees to the gala awards dinner with small and medium businesses throughout city of sydney taking the opportunity to gain recognition for their hard work and achievement
8844618 a thriving and creative small to medium business sector is very much part of our vision for sustainable sydney 2030 so its encouraging to see the impressive level of participation the commitment of time energy and imagination these awards generate

8844620 didnt you love the phony language exercise where the faux italian family meets the faux czech family for dinner and they all have to put on carpet slippers and eat mayonnaise dips until the czech host takes them into the bathroom to watch while he kills the live carp in the bathtub the carp theyre going to have for dinner and he kills it with a carp hammer can you imagine a carp hammer and all this in the context of a picture book designed to teach english as a second language

8844629 to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers and the emergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
8844630 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets
8844631 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

8844638 they were unloading the grain and at some point it was realized that the boys at least one of them anyway was trapped in the grain
8844639 these types of trailers theres a chute underneath it comes into a hopper and at the base of the hopper theres a sliding trap door that opens to unload these trailers so they unload very rapidly
8844640 thereby compelling delivery by firms across all industries on a triple bottom line of economics social and environmental performance
8844641 indian companies should take proactive measures to ensure adequate risk appraisal and management as well as leverage opportunities arising out of climate change
8844642 they need to do proper due diligence for clean development mechanism cdm projects to assess the quantum of carbon credits expected to be generated indian businesses also need to consider tax and regulatory issues and devise strategies to help ensure that they can maximise the benefit from the cdm process

8844650 wir hatten wegen des schlechten wetters im monat juli sogar ein minus von 26 prozent das ist mit dem restlichen sommer nicht wieder aufzuholen
8844651 ich und alle angestellten von ferrari sind sehr traurig ber den tod von phil hill er war ein echter champion und hat immer alles f r unseren rennstall gegeben
8844652 dem neuen zeitalter in das wir eintreten fehlen viele zutaten f r einen kalten krieg russland ist milit risch nicht so stark wie die sowjetunion war und seine reichweite ist nicht global es kann waffen nach syrien oder an den iran liefern aber es kann keine revolution in angola oder kuba mehr beginnen russland ist schamlos kapitalistisch aber er ist auch frei eigene allianzen zu schmieden h rt auf so zu tun als sei dies nur ein simpler kampf zwischen autorit ren regierungssystemen und den westlichen liberalen demokratien die aus vielen ethnien bestehende post sowjetische landkarte ist komplexer als das lokale konflikte sollten auch lokal bleiben
8844653 obwohl russland keinen kalten krieg ausschlie t ist die russische bedrohung sicherlich nicht vergleichbar mit der bedrohung durch die islamisten es gibt hnlichkeiten des westens mit russland die eine ann herung m glich machen die freie welt kann allerdings die provokationen des kremls mit der anerkennung s dossetiens und abchasiens nicht ohne antwort lassen nat rlich hatte der westen unrecht als er die unabh ngigkeit der serbischen provinz kosovo absegnete doch wladimir putin und dmitri medwedew denen das schicksal der minderheiten gleichg ltig ist haben einen machtkampf begonnen den die europ ische union nicht verlieren darf
8844654 einer umfrage zufolge glauben 74 prozent der russen dass georgien nichts weiter ist als eine schachfigur f r washington und daf r muss der georgische pr sident michail saakaschwili in den augen der russen bestraft werden genau wie f r seinen angriff auf s dossetien mit der anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit s dossetiens und abchasiens hat moskau dennoch aus diplomatischer sicht einen fehler begangen
8844655 die meisten profite der russischen rohstoffexporte landen ohnehin in den taschen der oligarchen w hrend die mehrheit der bev lkerung in armut lebt daher w rde eine methode den kreml in schwierigkeiten zu bringen darin bestehen dass der westen beginnt die legalit t der gesch fte der russischen oligarchen zu untersuchen die im westen leben diese w rden dann die regierung in moskau bedr ngen ihre beziehungen zum westen zu verbessern kurzfristig ist es wichtig dass die staaten der nato und eu die einigkeit wenigstens simulieren
8844656 bisher hat moskau alle westliche kritik zum georgien konflikt br sk abgewiesen es fehlt dort jedes verst ndnis wieso die russische machtanwendung sorgen und ausgesprochene unruhe ausgel st hat russland ist vorerst ziemlich allein geblieben und hat seine nachbarn in ost und west herausgefordert sicher steht das land reich und m chtig da aber es ist nicht so reich und m chtig dass es sowohl seine nachbarn die internationalen institutionen und das v lkerrecht herausfordern kann ohne dass dies auf russland selbst zur ckf llt
8844657 f r viele in russland ist unabh ngig von ihrer haltung zu putin und medwedew georgien der aggressor auf den die russische regierung und die armee ad quat reagiert haben man ist entsetzt ber die voreingenommenheit der westlichen narration des krieges und verliert endg ltig den glauben an den mythos der westlichen pressefreiheit dem autorit ren regime in russland ist es tats chlich gelungen die amerikanischen und europ ischen medien vor den eigenen b rgern zu diskreditieren
8844658 lib dem supporters go back to your constituencies and prepare for oblivion
8844659 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8844660 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8844661 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8844662 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8844663 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8844664 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8844665 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8844666 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8844667 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8844668 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8844669 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8844670 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8844671 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8844672 ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8844673 a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8844674 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8844675 giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to rich companies to allow them to continue polluting is immoral and uneconomic

8844692 a month ago many female cats in heat came to harass him and then the wings started to grow
8844693 she comes out of this week in denver and the entire election season as a bigger and more powerful figure than she ever was before
8844694 it gets hard sometimes yeah wed be lying if we said it didnt
8844695 but you try not to let years past affect year present its a different team than we had last year a different team than we had five years ago so you try to look at it that way
8844696 that is something i have tried to pay close attention to because it has been an issue consistently enough where it is not just bad luck
8844697 i dont know whether there is one specific reason because each year there has probably been something different
8844698 one year we didnt hit one year we didnt pitch one year we got hurt it could be all sorts of different reasons but i would say the two main ones would be depth and scheduling
8844699 we are going to play no matter what but i think there is something to be said for every pitch every out means something something even more than for us probably
8844700 not that we take anything lightly or for granted i dont want that to come across that way and i dont think anybody would see it that way its just the nature of sports
8844701 a lot of these guys who were here last year are back this year
8844702 i think last year a lot of guys had a hard time mentally preparing themselves for games or for coming to the park its not that you dont give your all its more of a mental thing than anything i think the guys who were here last year no one wants to go through that again
8844703 guys are aware what has happened around here and are doing everything they can to not only to make it better but to make it as best as it possibly can be
8844704 you just try to build up the depth in the areas that are going to be the most meaningful when you are making that finishing kick for the season
8844705 i think right after that well be ready to get going

8844714 most students still buy print versions of textbooks and carrying them around is as big a pain as it has been for past generations of students
8844715 most publishers now offer electronic versions of their textbooks mcgraw hill education for example publishes 95 of their books electronically as well as in print but there is no compelling device to read them on
8844716 a new large screen kindle would solve those problems the battery life is much longer than most electronic devices and carrying a large kindle is still a lot better than carrying ten heavy textbooks our guess is that amazon will make a major push into the educational markets next year its the only obvious reason to create a large screen kindle
8844717 the answer is yes its happening already its going to be happening more swiftly in the coming years theres been a feeling of inevitability about it
8844718 what we believe is that students are going to purchase their textbooks in a number of different places and theres not kind of a monolithic approach to this
8844719 we believe firmly that the most significant gating factor in prior eras of this has been that there hasnt been a critical mass of inventory available on a single platform
8844720 we believe as standards emerge the market will grow and as common platforms emerge the market will grow we dont even necessarily believe it has to be our platform
8844721 people dont get into foolish false dichotomies its not either or its supplemental
8844722 carrying a large kindle is still a lot better than carrying ten heavy textbooks

8844731 if nato takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8844732 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained
8844733 let us hope that we do not see any direct confrontation
8844734 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea
8844735 nato is conducting a routine and long planned exercise limited to the western part of the black sea the exercise is not related to the crisis in georgia
8844736 a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8844737 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8844738 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8844739 there is no question of launching an all out war with russia
8844740 no one ever doubted that a russian army of up to 800 000 people was going to defeat a georgian army of up to 18 000 people indeed that has happened over the last two weeks the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8844741 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8844742 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8844743 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8844744 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that are of interest to them
8844745 anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8844746 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them
8844747 interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it

8844923 after 30 plus years devoting myself to my art and craft i needed to make a musical statement that someday i could look back on and realize at that moment of time i did exactly what i wanted to do ive never written songs like this i was on this inspirational roll there was an urgency to it i realized that i had no more time in my life for rehearsals and i took that energy into the studio

8845047 seriously sick and injured people do not need their hardworking doctors and nurses to be distracted by a tirade from an incompetent minister
8845048 they have every right to make public comment however i think theres a responsibility on everybody that they provide accurate advice
8845049 thats silly but the word crisis must certainly be one of the most overused words in the political vocabulary
8845050 what i believe is a crisis is when the system is going backwards when you have beds closing medical staff resigning when you fail to keep pace with the numbers coming through the door youre in free fall
8845051 what we have in queensland health is in fact the opposite
8845052 there is pressure when the system is working to capacity
8845053 when it has gone beyond capacity in my opinion that is a significant issue it is dysfunctional it is a crisis

8845061 fans who had purchased tickets in rotterdam and oberhausen were very disappointed as the tour was called off at the last minute but we could do nothing about it we arrived at the decision to call off the tour after weighing the pros and cons of every possible solution the local promoters defaulted at the last minute making it impossible for us to continue with the shows
8845062 the official take is that local promoters defaulted and did not meet the requirements of wizcraft and stars on the tour however one of the main reasons for calling off the tour is mediocre ticket sales the tickets are very expensive and the meet and greet with the stars comes at an additional price also as compared to the unforgettable tour the tickets of srks temptations shows were much cheaper considering another temptations tour being in the offing in europe including germany bollywood fans were in no mood to buy expensive tickets for the unforgettable tour
8845063 the promoters of the show have defaulted on the contract im not authorised to give a comment on this and ticket price is not an issue all our other nine shows in canada trinidad and in entire usa and london were sold out
8845064 considering the fact that we are planning to have our segment of the show in europe we had an afterthought about doing the shows now in rotterdam and oberhausen we have now scheduled shows in the said european cities for our second segment in europe

8845184 what can only be described as a plethora of articles on windows vista almost all of them repetitive one sided and of little practical use

8845189 i support this law 100 but i know it will cause shortages
8845190 the fact is the health ministry doesnt have enough drugs even in hospitals how will it fill the vacuum
8845191 the situation is ridiculous we dont know what to do
8845192 they gave us the terms and regulations but where are the solutions to meet them
8845193 i usually shut down my booth and hide the drugs inside
8845194 an hour later they disappear and everything is back to normal
8845195 most lame mockeries of movies completely unrelated to a retarded parodys broad premise
8845196 and so with more options for them it has driven the price up theyre able to shop
8845197 they want to make sure they can look good in front of the home crowd and get the media to be nice to them
8845198 it helps in the athletic department significantly as far as padding our budgets
8845199 what drives these prices up in many cases is when theres a change to a schedule somebody pulls out and then all of a sudden somebody needs a game
8845200 people right now who are looking for a game in 09 are going to pay a premium because theyre starting to panic
8845201 schools with huge stadiums when they can bring in an opponent at a reasonable price they can make a lot of money
8845202 the goal is to have the most productive three guys possible out there
8845203 whatever the situation calls for to get the optimal three guys out there
8845204 that guys definitely a ballhawk there are other phases of his game hes trying to get better at
8845205 they want me to kind of be the guy that can play more than one position and kind of help get some other guys on the field
8845206 i dont exactly know the whole plan but thats the vibe i got
8845207 1 they dont like me and 2 i dont like them
8845208 ill give you two good reasons why you should go to church 1 youre 59 years old and 2 youre the pastor

8845220 when we started doing this red army thing it was during the mackovic times and there wasnt a lot of fan support
8845221 stoops brought such a level of energy to this program that was pretty much nonexistent he got people excited to be at the games
8845222 i remember the last time arizona was ranked we were no 23 and playing ucla i mean it was a great october night we were ranked and the stadium was maybe three quarters full
8845223 thats good thats fine i am very passionate they get very upset when we lose games that we should have won believe me i understand that i am more upset than they are it hurts
8845224 i feel a lot better going into the season how it plays out shoot nobody knows
8845225 i want the same justice for every marine sailor soldier serving in harms way
8845226 you dont know what combat is until youre in combat
8845227 its an extraordinary situation and there just wasnt enough evidence
8845228 people heard the shots but nobody saw who did the shooting thats not enough
8845229 we want colombia to take concrete steps to meet its obligations
8845230 ecuador is doing its part to impede the entry of narcos and armed irregulars and colombia should do more to impede their departure
8845231 the communication channels remain open the colombian government is disposed to advance in the mechanisms that would permit a prompt normalization of relations with ecuador
8845232 clearly held conversations with reyes and the farc to guarantee the farc would not operate in his country this tactic has given the impression his government is pro farc it is not
8845233 you have to pass these exams its serious its caa the civil aviation authority they insist upon you passing all these exams that they set its much harder than i anticipated
8845234 i did do a little bit for the goldie lookin chain boys maggot and eggsy
8845235 theyre great theyre sweethearts i did a little bit for them youve got to i suppose theres interesting people on this trip diverse
8845236 i think kenzie could go quite a long way maybe chico could as well im being diplomatic here but i just find it hard to call i just dont know there might be some surprises
8845237 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming but also more people involved in exercising
8845238 i hope im literally not a fish out of water in that one
8845239 they didnt have the high technology suits and goggles and faster pools
8845240 lets just say my foots got caught in the door
8845241 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8845242 this fight will demonstrate to everyone that there is no sport universally as popular as boxing
8845243 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8845244 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya in this bout i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger
8845245 a lot of people are going to be very surprised when were standing next to each other
8845246 size isnt going to be that much of a difference
8845247 i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer like that
8845248 he knows my style and he knows mannys and for him to say that was a big challenge
8845249 what a great come from behind win just a great win i mean exciting
8845250 this place really got loud i dont know if it was the loudest ive heard it but let me tell you what it was loud
8845251 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8845252 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8845253 i was hoping to play next to him but now i have to wait a few weeks it looks like
8845254 it will be awesome when we get on the field at the same time together
8845255 he is a good athlete and a good receiver and he catches the ball well im anxious to see how he blocks that is something that is hard to simulate those live looks in practice because they are pretty big collisions with the fullbacks and the linebackers you try to save that for saturdays im anxious to see how he plays and how physical he plays
8845256 football has always been there in the back of my mind
8845257 you never forget about it i took a year off and i couldnt wait to have it come back
8845258 i have to catch every pass thrown to me and do my job
8845259 i have to make my blocks and dont miss any assignments i have to let them know i am there
8845260 robbie is a big part of what we are doing but nobody has batted an eye dykes said
8845261 we have just said we dont have him and moved on that is what good teams do obviously we wish he was playing but i think the team has handled it well
8845262 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
8845263 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
8845264 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
8845265 it feels like i didnt play football in two years
8845266 it feels good to be out there i picked up where i left off now just keep it going
8845267 there is a sense of urgency and a sense of having to win there is no time to wait
8845268 we think with our schedule that we could easily be 6 0 coming out i think that is a great possibility
8845269 we have put the past behind us and we dont talk about that anymore
8845270 we know what we have to do we used to talk about it a lot the history of arizona and not going to a bowl game but not anymore its a whole new attitude
8845271 we thought it would be good to get feedback and know what people are thinking before we do deliberate and talk among ourselves if we do talk about it among ourselves
8845272 the government has just gotten so intrusive in our lives
8845273 that i think people are starting to get tired of it
8845274 its about our recreational choice how we want to spend our beach time
8845275 its a rights issue it really is people who are offended by the human body choose to be offended some of us choose not to be offended the rights of those who choose to be offended shouldnt carry any greater weight than those of us who choose not to
8845276 why is it any of her neighbors business what color she paints her house
8845277 if they dont like it its only because theyve chosen to be bothered by it
8845278 some of my friends are like whats wrong with you
8845279 a high school counselor told me about it i always liked science and math and it seemed like a great opportunity
8845280 its more competitive today to get into your college of choice than ever before
8845281 unfortunately its just something thats become necessary if you want to get ahead
8845282 to get accepted into some schools the competition is so steep and they have to decide if thats worth the price
8845283 i think some of the creativity gets kind of drilled out of them
8845284 its a lot of hours its intense we have homework
8845285 my parents are kind of making me but i know it will be totally worthwhile when i take the sat
8845286 the jump is because high school students are starting earlier to work on their college degree
8845287 theyre very ambitious they seem to have a much clearer vision of what they are going to do with their lives than my peers did when i was in high school they know where they want to go they know where they want to be and they know what theyre going to do to reach those goals its really impressive
8845288 you have a shared consciousness in a neighborhood and that lot stamped us this was a place of crime and blight and it shaped our attitudes our identities if it was green and had a few trees yeah a whole new world
8845289 you have a shared consciousness in a neighborhood and that lot stamped us this was a place of crime and blight and it shaped our attitudes our identities if it was green and had a few trees yeah a whole new world
8845290 why dont they have a liquor store on every block why is it so green
8845291 you have a shared consciousness in a neighborhood and that lot stamped us this was a place of crime and blight and it shaped our attitudes our identities if it was green and had a few trees yeah a whole new world
8845292 they said going once going twice and there was this one guy in the back of the room who put up his paddle
8845293 snake venom drips from their lips their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness
8845294 okay sweetie ive had you for nearly 8 years now and theyve been a good 8 years youve seen me through a lot and i really appreciate it i realize youre not as young as you used to be and at this point ive needed to sink some good money into keeping you running smooth im happy to do this but you have to realize that when you have this many breakdowns and problems and cost me this much money in so short a time it gives me pause it gives anyone pause and causes them to wonder at what point you need to swallow your pride and trade up for a new model again youve been good to me and that counts for a lot in my world you deserve as much chance as i can spare you so im gonna sink another small fortune into your upkeep today but no more not for at least a couple years please dont break my heart
8845295 of course at this time of the year were all trying to figure it out mayfield said
8845296 it will be a real good opener for us we are going to try to do some things we havent been able to do in the past it just depends on how fast we can pick it up up front
8845297 were going to have to find out where were at and go from there
8845298 we return many of our skill kids but up front were brand new mayfield said
8845299 we only have a few seniors on our offensive and defensive line
8845300 mayfield and i like to shorten the game and we like to run the football mccollum said
8845301 the score will be close and i think it will be decided in the fourth quarter
8845302 both teams are evenly matched theyre young and were young its going to be a great football game
8845303 weve been looking good even though we are young mccollum said
8845304 i like the way we have come together as a team i like the way were playing right now were not in bad shape for a young squad
8845305 well be all right we got beat thats pretty much what it came down to
8845306 i think right after that well be ready to get going
8845307 i wouldnt think so just the way it has been but who knows
8845308 once youre in the batting practice arena youre getting very close
8845309 hes got good command of his off speed stuff hes moved fairly quickly through our system and people have been real high on him
8845310 this is the best i have felt since early in houston
8845311 i have played decent games where i have not felt good
8845312 i felt i sporadically made plays and things lucked into happening tonight i was in control of what was going on and that hasnt happened in a long time
8845313 when the regular season starts its a whole new ballgame
8845314 its disappointing that triple a baseball is not going to be there anymore
8845315 obviously the 1991 season when we won the championship and that last game was probably my most memorable game probably the most memorable game in tucson history
8845316 i had a lot of good friends and fans there no doubt
8845317 i played there seven different seasons i started in 1988 until 1994 i got a chance to go back over there ive always enjoyed going back and it was always a thrill playing before the fans
8845318 there were a lot of good fans and a lot of good people mikulik said
8845319 i met a lot of good people there with my former teammates there every time we talk we talk about those years it was one of my favorite places to play
8845320 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8845321 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8845322 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8845323 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8845324 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8845325 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8845326 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8845327 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8845328 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8845329 they want to speed the game up make the call
8845330 the way they are building them now with all the angles its tougher to see what is going on
8845331 it doesnt really matter either way for me i hope it doesnt distract anything i hope they get the calls right
8845332 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8845333 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8845334 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8845335 one ordinary guy is giving the candidates a reason to run
8845336 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8845337 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8845338 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8845339 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8845340 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8845341 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8845342 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8845343 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8845344 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8845345 i decided this past week i wanted to swim for the team again
8845346 ive been helping as an assistant coach for awhile here and it is so much fun we have a real good team and im happy to be a part of it again
8845347 i never doubted for a second i was good enough to be there and as i watched it on television i was like those are my friends thats my team it was tough for awhile but i never thought i wouldnt get back in the pool
8845348 she came in my classroom at sahuaro and started telling me
8845349 she wasnt even done saying it and i was already hugging her
8845350 they knew they wanted to get him signed right away
8845351 it was all sort of a surprise and happened so fast but its what he wanted from the start so hes real happy with how things have turned out
8845352 anything could change i guess depending on what football schools might want me but i really like san diego state and would love to play both sports there
8845353 weve had some real good players come through here and that has helped us get some great scouts and some of the top college programs to make this event every year
8845354 its out of my control and when thats the case its not something to waste time worrying about but im sure theres something to it and they have plans for it
8845355 if they didnt he wouldnt have been taking ground balls over there
8845356 i think its a situation where sometimes guys get labeled
8845357 its a big part of this game where they dont let guys go out there and play if youre not out there within four five years thats what you just sort of become
8845358 i dont know how someone can be harsh to an animal and proceed to ask god for compassion the next minute
8845359 such tale bearing is known in hebrew as moser informer individuals who have sunk to this lowest level of behavior were despised and shunned in jewish tradition they are considered worse than heretics or apostates
8845360 a person who turns over a jewish person or his property to gentiles is a moser and has no part in the world to come it is permissible to execute the moser even today when there is no capital punishment it is permissible to kill the moser before he informs if he has been told not to inform and insists on informing then he who executes the moser first has great merit
8845361 the trial of capital offenses is the office of the court and it is not the duty of individuals to implement this particular halacha
8845362 between the ideology of gush emunim and the ideology of peace now
8845363 it is actually more accurate to say that the struggle is not really ideological rather its practical tactical to an astonishing degree faith based land holding vs short term motivated talebearing
8845364 as a handle in war between left and right between the jews
8845365 this kind of tale bearing to the court or to the european union and wealthy non governmental foundations across the world is called moser
8845366 the legal authorities must not stand for the phenomenon that is evidenced by alleged rabbi yisrael rozen and not allow such incitement and calls to murder
8845367 peace now will continue in its struggle to put a stop to the illegal construction of settlements and the struggle for a sane future for the state of israel the organization will appeal to the attorney general in order to file charges against the rabbi and his dangerous words
8845368 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records
8845369 shmarya rosenberg traced the fraudulent comments on his site to a 5w address
8845370 if he wenger said to us i want this guy and hes 30m can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8845371 we want to win and win badly but ars ne believes in creating teams the way he does theres a dual problem for him
8845372 if we were to buy names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way ars ne plays
8845373 they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters whove been brought through
8845374 i think it is time we won something again but only one club can win the champions league and one can win the premiership
8845375 we were close as you possibly can be last year we are optimistic this year
8845376 it is very interesting for us to know that the steatoda nobilis spider is continuing to spread further afield in england
8845377 it is the rarer of the six varieties of the fake black widow and in terms of bites is the most harmful
8845378 unfortunately while trying to remove the spider carefully i accidentally killed it but this has allowed me to bring it back to the museum and identify it with certainty and we have now labelled it and catalogued it in the museums collection
8845379 there have been a number of incidences of bites from these spiders in england usually when the spider for some reason gets trapped against the skin like if it is caught in clothing or footwear
8845380 they will react by biting but like this spider in reading they will sit happily in their web for months without provocation
8845381 we have a real interest in confirming the identity of these spiders as many sightings are not reported
8845382 we are following a pattern of their habitation and we can see that in line with climate change they are expanding and spreading further across the country
8845383 they started at a number of points across the south coast and it is in these areas that we have had reports of bites about two dozen in total
8845384 one woman quite recently was bitten in the finger and had a painful throbbing sensation from her fingertip right up to her shoulder and another woman bitten on the thumb had to have treatment on it internally after her thumb turned black
8845385 i am relieved to know the true identity but now she is gone it feels a little strange not having her in the porch
8845386 she has actually laid eggs behind our gas meter now but stuart told us not many of them are likely to survive
8845387 we dont really want little babies crawling into the house again so stuart told us just to call him again if we were worried about it when they hatched
8845388 it is strange to think they are so rare around here
8845389 we have been making good progress in seeing an increase in the number of young people interested in our services which we are delighted with and we are continuing to develop programmes to encourage young people to seek help to quit smoking
8845390 we are always aiming to try and attract more young people to use our services and we are always trying new things to get them involved and wanting to quit
8845391 currently we only run one on one services for people under 16 but we are starting up group sessions to help as well and we hope this will mean young people can get motivation from others their own age as well as from stop smoking professionals
8845392 i think young people are realising that smoking is not cool like it used to be and i think that is down to a change in the stop smoking message
8845393 quitting is no longer seen as something old people do to try and improve their health
8845394 kids are realising that smoking from day one is just ruining your health and can have serious consequences on things like appearance and ability at sport
8845395 i think we struggle to try and increase awareness of our services regardless of age group but i think traditionally young people are less motivated to stop smoking because at that age they see themselves as immortal whereas by 40 plus the effects of smoking can begin to show
8845396 the attitude and awareness of the damage to health has been raised overall nationally and i think that is filtering through to all age groups
8845397 there is no benefit to smoking in terms of health or financially
8845398 i cant imagine where young people can find the money to fund a smoking habit and we support all government initiatives to try and prevent young people from smoking and if they decide to sell only packs of 20 instead of cheaper packs of 10 we will fully support that move
8845399 we have got services available to anyone in berkshire west who wants to use them and we would really encourage people to come to us and quit we have a higher than average success rate in getting people to quit 57 per cent overall compared to 51 per cent nationally so we do help
8845400 the car hit the kerb and went over to the right side of the road the car went up the kerb then started to roll it came to rest facing back towards the road i have no idea why she struck the kerb initially
8845401 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8845402 i had flown with zoom before and they were great
8845403 i stabbed him when he was in bed and then he woke up and attacked me i carried on stabbing him stabbing stabbing stabbing
8845404 you dont want to go in there there is stuff you dont want to see
8845405 there is a bloke in there i stabbed him in the neck 10 times he wouldnt die
8845406 daniel quelch was asleep in bed with his two year old son
8845407 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8845408 the disclosure that a whitehall counter terrorism propaganda operation is promoting material to the bbc and other media will raise fresh concerns about official news management in a highly sensitive area
8845409 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
8845410 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8845411 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8845412 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8845413 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8845414 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8845415 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8845416 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8845417 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8845418 it was a fun tournament last year and i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament

8845430 shut down madisonville at the net with their blocks and hitting
8845431 they have a very small gym and that gives them a huge home court advantage we adjusted our practice by placing chairs around the court this week and it helped us tremendously
8845432 im seeing major improvement in some of the things the girls are doing they are becoming a more aggressive team at the net and our attacks are improving unfortunately our serve receive and blocking were not very strong tonight and that hurt us a lot
8845433 well be arriving in atlanta in about ten minutes wed like you to fasten your seat belts were having reports of some ice on the runway

8845436 wir konnten nur wenige chancen herausspielen darum m ssen wir als spieler mit diesen pfiffen leben und versuchen sie wegzustecken vielleicht ist es ein gutes omen dass wir in nun einen starken gegner bekommen und die h rde schaffen k nnen
8845437 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8845438 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8845439 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8845440 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8845441 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8845442 were just trying to keep people away from it until it can be cleaned up
8845443 we have not seen anything like this for the past two decades in terms of what avalon is experiencing
8845444 but finding one needle in an isolated incident is not what we would classify as medical waste wash up
8845445 we came down here to relax and entertain our family
8845446 it will be interesting to learn where this all came from
8845447 if someone is doing this on purpose it wont change how we feel about the shore weve been coming here our whole lives so its not going to color our opinion of the place

8845454 i regret my actions the harm they caused my family my friends and this community
8845455 a very good man who has touched the lives of thousands of people
8845456 what to do to avert this nightmare many governments including those of israel the u s and canada take this question to menashe amir
8845457 amir is the voice of israel in iran but hes much more than that
8845458 a sampling of calls from iranians recorded and translated from farsi by cbc news at menashe amirs jerusalem studio
8845459 iranians can call a number in germany so that theyre not seen to be calling the
8845460 long live the people of israel who have so much freedom and democracy that they can prosecute their prime minister
8845461 in an interview with cbc news amir said the west has failed to understand the iranian threat he believes the regime is opposed by most iranians but is consumed by an apocalyptic vision the triumph of shia islam also known as shiite over the world
8845462 on the same day in the same speech that ahmadinejad called for wiping off israel from the map he added that the destruction of israel is the first step of our final confrontation with western civilization
8845463 amir says the regime dreams of a new caliphate an islamic empire spanning the globe
8845464 i want to tell you one more thing that the western countries dont understand or dont take it serious and thats the item of the mahdi the shiite messiah and they believe that once the mahdi comes the whole universe will convert to shiite islam
8845465 what scares israelis even more is that this fundamentalist world view is married to high technology
8845466 they have the money the missiles they are seeking to have the nuclear bomb and the life of humankind is not important for them
8845467 but amir says the iranian people dont share the regimes messianic vision he says most would support an attack on irans nuclear facilities and even rise up against the regime
8845468 iranians are totally a different nation a peaceful polite moderate people who want a good life who adore the united states who respect canada who like western music but the regime in iran doesnt feel like theyre iranians mostly firstly they think they are shiite muslims and they have to work for the sake of islam and not for the sake of iran and they are sacrificing the iranian interest for the sake of shiism
8845469 but not everyone shares amirs view on the fragility of irans government
8845470 one who does not is shabtai shavit who ran israels legendary spy service the mossad from 1989 96 shavit whos now a security consultant says the notion of iranians overthrowing the regime in the wake of an israeli strike is a fantasy
8845471 still shavit agrees with amir that israel must not assume that the regime will act rationally
8845472 we have to make our decisions according to the worst case scenario theyre going to have the bomb
8845473 theyre going to pursue an unrational way and theyre going to use the bomb if this is the case then i dont have any other choice but to pre empt it
8845474 amir says his iranian callers believe israel has an obligation to act
8845475 they claim the israelis and the jews have a historical debt to the iranians because 2 000 years ago cyrus the great came freed jews from babylon and he sent them back to their country to build again their homeland iranian listeners say now thats the time you pay us back please come and help us to get rid of this regime
8845476 i know that these measures will go a long way toward reducing our carbon footprint
8845477 we stand to save a lot of money and reduce our energy consumption
8845478 if im old enough to die for my country im old enough to drink
8845479 our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that the age 21 minimum is not working a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
8845480 it was in the millions so many millions that it was beyond anything we could collect readily we put on these fundraisers and the funds we garner go into an account with cuesta college to be used only for the theater
8845481 even before the earthquake there was a strong voice that we needed more performing arts opportunities or venues in north county
8845482 even a rough gauge of hiv incidence is a valuable tool for understanding and combating the spread of hiv
8845483 researchers may be able to discern increases and decreases in hiv incidence over time and target prevention efforts accordingly
8845484 the large and growing unmet need for pediatric hiv aids services demonstrates that failure of our pmtct programs to avert parent to child transmission of hiv
8845485 if we prevent hiv infection in children then we do not need to take care of them when they are infected
8845486 cultural beliefs social stigma ignorance and economic status influenced the mothers attitudes and preference for the different feeding alternatives
8845487 deny their spouses the opportunity to participate in the program
8845488 we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren are born and remain free from hiv aids
8845489 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection
8845490 it was not until the era of haart which restored the t cell levels that an increased incidence of asthma was noted
8845491 extraordinary mutability and resulting genetic diversity of hiv which is substantially more complex than that of other human viruses also present a formidable obstacle to immune control
8845492 may not be able to develop an hiv vaccine that is highly effective in the classic sense of successful viral vaccines
8845493 if we do it will be in the face of enormous scientific challenges
8845494 must turn to fundamental research to a degree that has not been required in the development of vaccines for other viral diseases
8845495 implement effective and multifaceted treatment and prevention programs advance human rights and invest in aids health care systems
8845496 worse than was previously known particularly among blacks and men who have sex with men
8845497 black leaders called for the united states to develop a national aids strategy and a domestic pepfar program
8845498 to understand why marginalized populations are at higher risk of infection you have to recognize that these groups often do not have equal access to housing education health care clean drinking water or nutrition
8845499 marginalized groups also face discrimination and have less control of funding streams for health and social welfare purposes
8845500 enjoy rights and a quality of life much higher than do people in other nations
8845501 legal system acknowledges constitutional and civil rights but not human rights
8845502 void when it comes to advocating for the right to quality health care for everyone
8845503 without equal access to quality health care the epidemic will only continue to increase in much of the world
8845504 some societies are busy playing the blame game to avoid taking on their fair share of the systematic responsibility for infections the medical community aids service organizations and human service agencies around the world are in the trenches trying to save lives
8845505 we will never have enough resources to defeat this epidemic if we dont have the support of our communities
8845506 opt out testing for human immunodeficiency virus in the united states
8845507 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young

8845574 josie what on earth are you doing to the window
8845575 ella shes the girl that moved in down the road by the river ariel and i met her before we seen her at the river is that who you are talking about
8845576 i mean i hardly know her she could be a friend maybe like in the future or not i dont know yet
8845577 she wanted to know if you could talk i told her of course that you were grounded what is she doing here at this hour josie its ten oclock at night were you expecting her or was she expecting you
8845578 no neither i dont know maybe her parents dont care if she is out late i dont know her well enough to know why she would just show up i didnt even think she knew where i lived
8845579 i noticed they didnt know who i was did they
8845580 it doesnt matter josie i wanted to talk to you
8845581 i cant explain it but i like you alot when you didnt come to the river these last couple of days i felt like crap i dont have alot of friends hell i dont have any friends its not just that though i really like you
8845582 i know me too except for the not having friends thing i just meant i missed you too
8845583 i wanted to tell you that i am not a virgin
8845584 im not but its not like you think it happened fast and it was nothing
8845585 no listen it was van gogh but he never did it again i thought i had too and afterward i cried and cried and he didnt know how to react he sat at the edge of the bed and he said im sorry ella i thought for sure he would hate me or hurt me or at least leave me to fend for myself and spread nasty rumors he didnt we stayed together and he slept with other girls he never even tried to touch me again we were fine with it i guess me and van gogh we werent really in love or anything he was just protecting me
8845586 but patrick did show up patrick is in juvy because of me josie he almost killed kudos he had a gun and kudos guys moved after patrick shot a bullet passed them which got kudos attention long enough for me to get out of the space between him and the brick wall patrick yelled go home ella but i was frozen kudos laughed and said that patrick wouldnt do it i was crying they were yelling and i was scared and next thing i know kudos lunged at patrick so patrick shot him
8845587 no he only got shot in the leg but he dropped to the pavement patrick grabbed my arm so fiercely i bruised for weeks and he pulled me away and we ran home when we got home i ran to my room and i cried some more mom and patrick were screaming because patrick was packing his bags she accused him of being a no good man like most men and said he was just like my father he was screaming he had to go he had to then the cops came
8845588 i found this on the road on my way here yours
8845589 i was praying and the flashlight landed on my hands and i thought god was showing me the light im so stupid
8845590 i dont think so i think you are very smart and cute when you blush
8845591 im not sure honestly she is often at the river so probably she is really nice
8845592 well maybe we can decide that for ourselves when we are properly introduced
8845593 but i hope in the future you would tell us about any new friends you make how old is ella
8845594 hmm well remember that she is older than you and that just because she is allowed to wear makeup and belly shirts doesnt mean a girl your age is allowed to do the same hell i wouldnt even allow you to wear those clothes at sixteen
8845595 no josie we didnt say we didnt approve im actually happy to know that you have others friends than ariel dont get me wrong ariel is great but its good for you to have other influences
8845596 i know ariel has been your guiding light for church and i know that you two have been inseperable for years now but you are both growing up and could end up being two very different people im just saying dont be surprised to find out that everything is going to change now
8845597 thats right you are a high schooler now and that means new classes new teachers and new friends just dont do anything stupid because of peer pressure
8845598 oh i had lots of crushes i had my first serious one in my freshman year he was dorky now that i look back but at the time i thought he was suave
8845599 no i mean not about you at my window they just want to meet you they actually said they wanted me to have more friends
8845600 tomorrow i have to let her know so she can plan dinner they dont really like unexpected guests
8845601 josie im not a godly person the idea that god is real its scary i am not saying he doesnt exist but if he does then he is like the boogy man he is always waiting in the shadow to get me for something i did wrong or something im thinking
8845602 so we are labrats god is like the big daddy who didnt ask me if i wanted to be born but expects me be okay with it
8845603 well maybe im not okay with it maybe not existing is easier than existing maybe i dont want to be your child i am not the antfarm sitting on your divine dresser
8845604 i didnt mean to scare you how did i scare you
8845605 i am trying so hard to dedicate myself to the lord now i dont know what to do
8845606 i want to i just dont know if the lord wants to love me what if i fail his test
8845607 this calmness i feel when i talk about god i mean normally when i am with others who believe i feel more calm
8845608 oh so you think that the doubt you feel about god is just a test why would god purposely make you doubt him that is a cruel interpretation listen i want to feel calm too i have problems and angst and i think we could both believe in god if we just interprete him differently
8845609 but do you think its about translation when we get to the judgement day and our verdict is flaming brimestone are we going to say oops i translated wrong i need to know
8845610 that is where the faith comes in you just have to have faith that what you are feeling is right
8845611 i have a digital camera i could take pictures maybe some other time
8845612 of course i just hope i know which voice is gods
8845613 dear god our heavenly father we come to you in prayer may our prayers be heard we praise you for your love and we have faith in your love may you lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil be a light unto our path amen
8845614 sounds good what do you girls want for dinner tomorrow
8845615 i suppose its the whole idea that i really do have a father that can still watch out for me to have a father who will accept me for who i am and love me i need to know that there is a point to everything you know a reason for the pain and the tough decisions
8845616 i think we really should just lay here and try listening hard
8845617 i think we should get up now especially since i keep thinking about ticks
8845618 i dont have any boyfriends i am still new here and i havent met any interesting boys josie is really the only person i know right now
8845619 well i dont know if youll meet any interesting boys hanging out with her since she obviously hasnt
8845620 i just meant that if there was any interesting boys im sure we would have heard about them already
8845621 thanks i got it when i was really young it was enormous then
8845622 well i dont have to be if you arent tired
8845623 why i mean if you want to i guess i could you shouldnt but i just figured wed share the bed

8845648 if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30million can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8845649 we totally back him its his decision if arsene found the right player he would buy that player but at the moment his hasnt
8845650 i have a feeling we can put this story to bed
8845651 i think with the purchase of pavlyuchenko the idea of arshavin moving to london no longer exists
8845652 espanyol have decided taking into account the player must leave next sunday to join up with his national team to authorise the player to travel to manchester to take a medical this friday while the english club deals with the documentation of the termination of the argentinian contract with the catalan team
8845653 until this moment espanyol have tried to convince zabaleta to continue in barcelona but the defender has shown his determination to continue his career in the premier league
8845654 they feel the carp are valuable enough to cover their expenses
8845655 when public dollars are at stake and someone offers to do it for free you go in that direction
8845656 we are excited to have someone of jeffs caliber and experience join sutherland
8845657 jeff understands the value and importance of sutherland in helping strengthen the conservative principles that act as the fundamental pillars of a free and prosperous utah
8845658 i am excited to have the opportunity to join the sutherland institute
8845659 i firmly believe in the values that form the core governing principles of the institute
8845660 thats important because provo has asserted jurisdiction for mining to occur in the canyon
8845661 i cant wait to hear your report i got a last minute ticket i swooned getting in was a bit of an ordeal but i actually expected to wait longer i wrote separate posts on getting in and on watching the speech i hope it was as great for you
8845662 that is stunning i love how the bluish purple looks like the spiral arms of the milky way galaxy or does it only have two makes me wish i had been in there i never got a pass to get in to the pepsi center
8845663 so if i can get an extra ticket do you want it
8845664 maar nu wil ik weten hoe hij het stelt kent iemand lars
8845665 hij was buiten bewustzijn en bloedde uit de neus en mond en aan zijn armen hij lag in volle zon en met zijn hoofd naar beneden sommige mensen wilden hem daarom omdraaien maar dat mag je niet doen door het lichaam te verplaatsen kan je grote schade aanbrengen
8845666 hij kon zeggen dat hij lars heette en belg was maar daarna verloor hij opnieuw het bewustzijn
8845667 ik had waarschijnlijk de handrem niet goed opgetrokken maar daar denk je in zon situatie niet aan
8845668 volgens de eigenaar van onze camping moet zijn toestand daarom ernstig zijn geweest dat maakt me nog ongeruster
8845669 ze vroegen of ik een kennis of familie van het slachtoffer was mogelijk kreeg ik geen informatie om privacyredenen
8845670 de man heet lars is een dertiger en belg maar waar is hij nu hoe stelt hij het heeft hij de klap overleefd dat weet ik allemaal niet en het kwelt me
8845671 we dont know who to give a lot of this stuff to
8845672 a lot of this stuff was never investigated because people dont report it
8845673 die niederbayern wird f r dieses jahr meine letzte rallye in deutschland sein ich fahre anschlie end noch mit dem mitsubishi auf sardinien einen vortest f r die geplante pwrc 2009 und danach mit dem 190er die rallye legend in san marino
8845674 es war fantastisch zu sehen wie mein vorsprung im zweiten stint so schnell gewachsen ist
8845675 nein denn wie oft passiert das in der formel 1 das ist v llig normal und es war nicht mal gef hrlich
8845676 emigreren is een mooi avontuur maar daarbij hebben wij wel erg geboft
8845677 waarschijnlijk krijgen maar weinig emigranten de ontvangst die ze in dit dorp krijgen enige tijd voor we vertrokken stuurde de presidente van de vrouwenvereniging een mail ze wilde weten welke boodschappen we moesten hebben en dan bedoelde ze niet alleen peper zout en suiker nee ze wilde ook achter een nieuw koffiezetapparaat aan en meer van zulk soort keukenhulpjes die je niet kunt meenemen naar canada zelfs een auto kon ze verzorgen maar we vonden het wel fijn om die zelf te kiezen toen we hier aankwamen was alles gereed
8845678 we arriveerden op woensdag en vrijdagnacht ging ik al aan het werk
8845679 dat liep best maar ik wilde iets anders een nieuw avontuur daarvoor zijn we verscheidene keren naar canada geweest en hebben we naar vele bedrijven ge nformeerd vaak was het te oud of te duur toen belde er een makelaar uit deze regio hij wist dat er iemand werd gezocht die een bakkerij met nederlandse producten wilde overnemen dat leek ons wel wat ik heb mijn bakkerspapieren voor ik de markt opging heb ik bij verschillende bakkers gewerkt
8845680 de nederlanders houden vaak niet van het canadese brood te zacht te weinig korst en het gebak is veel te zoet
8845681 ik vond het erg dat ik mijn vrienden niet meer zou zien en wist ook niet goed wat ik hier moest gaan doen
8845682 we waren hier nog maar even of er belde al een moeder die een jongen van dezelfde leeftijd had het gezin heeft een boerderij en ronald mocht komen logeren het was helemaal leuk dat hij nog net meekon met de schoolreis naar national park waterton
8845683 best spannend want ik kende niemand gelukkig spraken sommigen nederlands dus ik had al gelijk een paar vriendjes
8845684 sterker nog we spreken de familie nu vaker dan we in nederland deden we hebben ook niet het idee dat we zo vreselijk ver van huis zijn als er in de familie iets aan de hand is kun je binnen een dag op schiphol staan canada is dichtbij vergeleken met nieuw zeeland daar zou ik dan ook niet heen gaan
8845685 de herkenning die je daardoor hebt vinden we heel fijn
8845686 men zingt hier echter de psalters erg mooi maar je moet er wel even aan wennen verder is hier elke zondag nog een nederlandse dienst maar daar gaan wij niet heen we volgen altijd de engelstalige anders leer je de taal nooit
8845687 het is wel een hele stap als je met negen kinderen naar een ander werelddeel emigreert
8845688 een combinatie van factoren leidde ertoe dat we deze stap hebben gezet allereerst ons gezin we wilden graag een groter huis bovendien wilde gerard zelf een boerenbedrijf beginnen
8845689 eerst in de provincie british columbia maar als je daar boer wilt worden kun je net zo goed in nederland blijven het is er druk en duur we voelden veel meer voor alberta toen we hier kwamen waren we onder de indruk van de rust en de weidsheid van dit gebied we bezochten verschillende boerenbedrijven kerk en school waren zoals we gewend zijn dit leek ons wel wat
8845690 maar er kwamen eigenlijk geen negatieve kanten van emigratie bovendrijven
8845691 we wilden echter niet een zelfgekozen weg inslaan maar weten of het van de heere mocht we zeiden als het visum komt ligt de weg open de visumaanvraag verliep zeer voorspoedig en werd zelfs niet vertraagd doordat er tussentijds een dochter werd geboren toch had ik nog geen rust ik had in mijn hart nog niet het gevoel dat de heere met ons optrok we hebben daar veel om gevraagd op een keer werd in de kerk psalm 45 vers 5 gezongen de laatste vier regels klonken met kracht in mijn hart toen kwam er rust en mocht ik geloven dat we een bestaan in canada mochten krijgen
8845692 onze weg is zo gelopen het is niet dat nederland niet deugt en dat we dat land ontvlucht zijn we wijzen echt niet alles in nederland af maar voor ons als boeren en voor onze kinderen zagen we hier meer toekomst
8845693 het was een mooi moment toen in maart 2005 de eerste kalfjes arriveerden tegelijk was die eerste tijd niet de gemakkelijkste we waren er weliswaar helemaal naar toegegroeid maar als je emigreert voor jezelf begint en een groot gezin hebt dan heb je best veel aan je hoofd de hulp van andere mensen zullen we niet snel vergeten
8845694 de winter is langer en kan erg koud zijn het groeiseizoen is kort en krachtig
8845695 ook in de tuin moet je goed opletten in de zomer is het hier erg droog maar als je het goed bijhoudt kan er toch heel wat groeien
8845696 ik vroeg me af of ik zonder familie kon dat ging wel maar dat komt ook doordat we een groot gezin hebben natuurlijk dacht ik bij verjaardagen wel eens nu zitten ze in nederland gezellig bij elkaar
8845697 maar na een halfuur ben je dat ook weer vergeten op een andere manier kun je tegenwoordig heel goed contact houden
8845698 het schoolsysteem vinden we in nederland beter voor je hier een beroepsopleiding kunt kiezen ben je achttien tot die tijd doorloopt iedereen hetzelfde middelbaar onderwijs ben je geen student en weet je op je zestiende wat je wilt worden dan moet je dus eerst het middelbaar onderwijs afmaken er zit in nederland meer vaart in het onderwijs en je kunt meer keuzes maken
8845699 we waren een grote stadse gemeente gewend nu zijn we lid van een kleine plattelandsgemeente de leer is hetzelfde als in nederland maar het kerkelijk leven is anders wij voelen meer verbondenheid met elkaar dat komt ook doordat iedereen hetzelfde heeft meegemaakt iedereen is ge migreerd of hun ouders hebben dat eerder gedaan veel mensen hebben hier geen familie dus dan zoek je elkaar ook eerder op immigranten hebben het hier dan ook relatief makkelijk men weet wat je nodig hebt

8845701 if youre afraid mccain is going to drop dead hes got a vice president who is fully up to speed and can step in
8845702 it makes sense to put the two of them together
8845703 im guessing mccains advisers think well maybe we need a woman she might attract the women who are disappointed that hillary clinton didnt win to come over to the republican party
8845704 but i think women who feel that strongly about hillary arent inclined to vote republican
8845705 het belang van de kinderen weegt in deze kwestie zwaarder

8845708 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was seven or 10 years ago
8845709 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google hasnt at least from what i read about them evolved to that
8845710 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
8845711 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
8845712 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
8845713 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing

8845725 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8845726 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8845727 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8845728 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8845729 i knew that there was a website or going to be a website about troy buswell

8845735 manhandled during detention and tactical questioning the lack of significant physical injuries led him to conclude that the force used against each detainee was
8845736 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008 he said
8845737 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8845738 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger

8845819 as ive come to know him hes been very clear to me and not just in saying it but what his actions are that his goal my view is to do the right thing hes an extraordinary individual and his ultimate his goals are his principles and goals are to do whats best for pakistan and everything hes done our engagement indicates thats absolutely the case

8845863 not only the russians but saakashvili as well is responsible for what has happened
8845864 he failed to avoid a war we are considering different options including the need for early elections as we cant imagine how saakashvili could continue to govern this country after plunging it into such a deep crisis
8845865 the majority of people believe mr saakashvili has behaved bravely
8845866 this is not the proper time for this it is traitorous to question his leadership it is doing the work of putin when the focus should be on what he has done
8845867 from the very beginning ms burjanadze made it clear that she will return to active politics in the future
8845868 the recent crisis has only accelerated her plans to be fully involved in the political process
8845869 for years hes boasted about what hes done for us the electricity the roads and so on and then in one swoop he sent us back to square one
8845870 why couldnt he have found a way to talk to the russians instead of making war just from our district there were seven young lads killed
8845871 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8845872 i would just say that it wasnt what i would call an endorsement u
8845873 the fact that you havent seen countries come forth and recognize these two parts of georgias territory is a significant sign
8845874 expanding the group would realize russias goal of turning the sco into an anti american anti nato counterweight said yevgeny volk an analyst in moscow for the washington based heritage foundation research group
8845875 it comes as a result of western criticism of russia for its military action in georgia and for recognizing the breakaway regions
8845876 countries that do not belong to a region do not interfere with the countries of that region
8845877 russias active role in helping to create peace and cooperation in this region
8845878 either had to just walk past or stop the bloodshed of that long suffering people he said
8845879 chinas reaction to this dispute has been very muted because were also very aware of the secessionism in xinjiang tibet and the central asian countries also have the same worries said zhu feng a security expert at peking universitys school of international studies
8845880 unlike some of our major foreign partners we prefer that each country think for itself he said in dushanbe
8845881 will propose sanctions others will be against when they meet on sept 1 to discuss the situation in georgia in a subsequent statement kouchner said france hasnt called for sanctions will seek to forge a common eu position
8845882 stir up the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates in the u s presidential election
8845883 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8845884 in kindergarten i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
8845885 were meds the right thing i could be on the fence either way
8845886 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8845887 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8845888 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8845889 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8845890 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8845891 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8845892 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8845893 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city

8845896 i was here and i remember wolf blitzer and anderson cooper talking about it that night
8845897 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8845898 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides
8845899 ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8845900 for michigan his speech holds promise for our struggling economy and our domestic auto industry
8845901 if this is senator obamas idea of the change we need he can keep it
8845902 has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8845903 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8845904 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8845905 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8845906 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8845907 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8845908 a nation of whiners tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made
8845909 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8845910 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong yahoo has made it very very clear theyre going to take the best parts of their network and ours and combine them

8845947 these kinds of public allegations made without supporting evidence need to stop because im concerned this is starting to undermine public confidence in our public hospitals
8845948 this crisis would not have happened if the beattie bligh government had listened to frontline clinical staff
8845949 seriously sick and injured people do not need their hardworking doctors and nurses to be distracted by a tirade from an incompetent minister
8845950 they have every right to make public comment however i think theres a responsibility on everybody that they provide accurate advice
8845951 thats silly but the word crisis must certainly be one of the most overused words in the political vocabulary
8845952 what i believe is a crisis is when the system is going backwards when you have beds closing medical staff resigning when you fail to keep pace with the numbers coming through the door youre in free fall
8845953 what we have in queensland health is in fact the opposite
8845954 there is pressure when the system is working to capacity
8845955 when it has gone beyond capacity in my opinion that is a significant issue it is dysfunctional it is a crisis
8845956 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8845957 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8845958 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this
8845959 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8845960 since the government pulled the legislation from the house yesterday there has been no discussion with the unions and our members are furious at the lack of consultation
8845961 i believe it came from the journalists pocket thats what he told me on the day
8845962 were glad the matter has been resolved but reject totally what the defendants said in court as to their dealings with dylan howard except insofar as he was told that the documents were found in the street
8845963 a witness was present for all dealings between dylan and the individuals in question
8845964 we support dylan howard and can vouch for the fact that dylans conduct was entirely appropriate and not as described in court today
8845965 its more than just an unfortunate instance when you dismiss someone for taking part in strike action its illegal to dismiss people for taking part in strike action
8845966 i dont know what went on in there it was a pretty rowdy day
8845967 i think the speakers handling of the situation was pretty poor i dont know why i was bounced
8845968 i dont know why i was picked on when the ministers were getting away with murder
8845969 they wouldnt answer questions about why theyre threatening to withdraw funding from vital projects around the state when those projects are actually funded in budget documents and other planning documents
8845970 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8845971 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8845972 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8845973 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8845974 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening

8846005 singt das lied von zuffenhausen der mir versprochene termin bei dem wir ber das vw gesetz sprechen wollten hat bis zum heutigen tage nicht stattgefunden er hat noch nicht mal einen angeboten
8846006 i dont really know what the hell happened that night
8846007 i look for sounds that basically throw you off a little bit
8846008 i could hear the car sounds disintegrating for 25 minutes
8846009 they just had three things going on and it was beautiful
8846010 in case you have forgotten this is a machine my owner does not want siding the newspaper or the carpets cleaned he donates to charity through his office and does not want his picture taken if youre still with me leave a message and well see if he calls you back
8846011 a long pause so you think youre talking to an actual person
8846012 how do you leave an idiot in suspense leave a message and ill get back to you
8846013 okay so i liked your resume and called you for an interview but
8846014 to fund legacy pensions and retiree health care an average of about 7 billion a year a dramatic competitive and cash flow disadvantage
8846015 everyone covered by a health insurance program will submit a claim
8846016 everything has moved online including education though more and more americans are getting educated online there is still a bias toward traditional classroom education especially for high end careers and top ranked companies
8846017 a candidate with an online degree would have to be truly extraordinary otherwise to merit serious consideration
8846018 i dont think online degrees reflect a serious commitment to education on the part of the degree holder
8846019 why did i use a bare foot to kick away a broken glass table
8846020 must have worked full time for at least 20 weeks during a 12 month period before filing the initial claim
8846021 in general the extension will be the same dollar amount as the regular benefit but will last half as long up to 13 weeks
8846022 the program expires at the end of march 2009 unless congress renews it if the person runs out of regular benefits before then and is eligible for extended benefits the person can keep getting them past march 31
8846023 as fewer jobs are created spending power could dry up and more homeowners could fall behind on mortgages

8846026 the white house had threatened to veto the bill saying it would waste money by
8846027 e mergency steps such as broadening benefits for the whole country have been used only when the unemployment rate jumps considerably higher than 5 5 percent
8846028 extending benefits to all states regardless of unemployment rates means that states such south dakota and wyoming which have 2 6 percent unemployment rates would also get extensions
8846029 i dont mind paying for breakfast and i dont mind paying twice what the breakfast was worth but you have to wonder why
8846030 i can take a coffee mug but not a t shirt or the other way around
8846031 dealing with the tear gas was easier than trying to figure out the ethics laws
8846032 it does require more effort on my part but i want to make my district proud
8846033 my district is a little more hypersensitive about that because of jim black
8846034 if a lawmaker crosses the borders of north carolina its not that the lobbying laws no longer apply
8846035 the public doesnt distinguish between being wined and dined at conventions or here in raleigh im glad legislators are being mindful
8846036 arent doing it for legislators theyre doing it for a larger group
8846037 you wonder how much sense it makes to segregate or separate elected officials
8846038 when you get legislation like that you need to figure out where you need to tweak it
8846039 the citizens of north carolina expect you to have common sense
8846040 i didnt even know it that he was living under these aliases
8846041 he was an easy person that i could talk to
8846042 adopted for life the priority of adoption for christian families and churches
8846043 you rarely see only one family who has adopted it becomes part of the culture of the congregation
8846044 both are saying the same thing segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever and both pretend theyre just being realistic about racial discrimination
8846045 every one of us who follows christ was adopted into an already existing family
8846046 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8846047 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8846048 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting alibis
8846049 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you
8846050 i think its a growing public awareness the problem is that most people feel like im not doing anything wrong so who cares but i think thats the wrong way of looking at it
8846051 we need to do due diligence and come to a consensus that we can present to the university of north carolina constituents
8846052 you cant build a lab in an energy star building that looks like mccorkle place
8846053 destroyed if the front yard is turned into a parking lot and the vista destroyed
8846054 there will be times of growth and times when flights are reduced we focused on building a terminal that is flexible to meet the needs of a growing region
8846055 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8846056 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8846057 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8846058 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8846059 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement
8846060 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8846061 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8846062 however there is a great view of the rocky mountains to the west i sit here soaking in the sun i have no shirt on
8846063 i was recently working in an organic lettuce farm in hawaii and after that i was a camp counselor and im currently unemployed
8846064 making movies about protests and questioning the validity of both the convention and protesting and trying to find a place in that dynamic
8846065 i just think that he has the capacity to really rally people together in a way that i havent seen before
8846066 the other day i went to the denver coliseum to see rage against the machine and the flobots and i was astounded by their ability to musically rally a large amount of people towards peaceful protest there was an amazing march that ensued after the concert it was unbelievably peaceful and rule y as opposed to unruly but focused and determined and i feel that on a more general level i would love to see barack rally a large amount of people a very large amount of people all together
8846067 actually id say hed be a belly itcher and not a pitcher
8846068 and we would like a pitcher and not a belly itcher
8846069 i didnt receive my absentee ballot along with a lot of other college students
8846070 management is optimistic about the future of the company having priority on the coal applications recently submitted and the expectation of the potash approval forthcoming will enable sidon to be active on multiple prospects in the second half of 2008
8846071 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8846072 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8846073 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8846074 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8846075 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8846076 i got done faster because i couldnt wait to see you
8846077 we are continuing the company strategy of developing and licensing proprietary techniques which offer distinct advantage to the companys client base we already have a number of proprietary techniques and were always looking to add more where we can find techniques which will provide clear advantage for our clients and adsam certainly fits that description
8846078 for qualitative research the advantage of adsam is that it can be easily executed in a 60 minute idi each exercise only takes 30 seconds to complete on the quantitative side it can be completed very efficiently and deliver more robust and usable emotional segments which feed into segmentation analysis and or message optimisation studies to aid decision making
8846079 it will be interesting to hear from the prosecutor when he will be able to have this new indictment
8846080 in terms of finding out about the beginning of the trial that will be vital
8846081 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8846082 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8846083 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8846084 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8846085 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8846086 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8846087 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8846088 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8846089 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8846090 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8846091 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8846092 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8846093 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8846094 in the absence of proper plans compensation and adequate alternative housing for at least 3 000 affected families the filling of the lake should be immediately halted otherwise this may be the beginning of the biggest forced eviction in post war cambodia
8846095 if the government wishes to develop boeung kak they should do so through a legal process with the participation of communities that live around the lake
8846096 affected communities need to be able to make informed decisions the serious lack of clear information and accountability shows that preparations are just not in place
8846097 pleasant trade and service places for domestic and international tourists
8846098 lets take your car back so you can drink and ill take you home later
8846099 these are carrefours best first half results since 2005 this strong performance attests to the relevance of our multi format single brand strategy on an international scale the group has robust fundamentals with a business model focused primarily on food a balanced portfolio of formats leading positions in the countries where it operates and a sound balance sheet these strengths along with our competitive advantages such as the power of our brand and our real estate potential give us the means to forge ahead and create greater value in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8846100 the israeli siege has turned gaza into a big prison we cannot leave not even for medical care or to study abroad and most of what we need is not available in gaza we are not living really we are barely surviving and the outlook for the future is bleak
8846101 break the siege that israel has imposed on the civilian population of gaza to express our solidarity with the suffering people of gaza and to create a free and regular channel between gaza and the outside world
8846102 the mission is to break the israeli siege an absolutely illegal siege which has plunged a million and a half palestinians into wretched conditions imprisoned in their own homes exposed to extreme military violence deprived of the basic necessities of life stripped of their most fundamental human rights and dignity the siege violates the most fundamental principle of international law the inadmissibility of harming civilian populations i cannot stand idly aside to do so would violate my commitment to human rights
8846103 the collective punishment of the population of gaza which has been instituted for months now has failed
8846104 the commencement of our new drilling campaign within the shallow fields production unit at the mtsare khevi field has progressed very well and we are encouraged by the results and efficient pace of our early work in this new development program as drilling continues our rolling development plan calls for these shallow wells to be completed and brought into production as quickly as possible in order to ramp up production from the field as it represents an important near term value component within our overall portfolio
8846105 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
8846106 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
8846107 it is high time for the ioc to put its core values of human dignity and universal fundamental ethical principles into practice by making human rights a new pillar of the olympic games
8846108 gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place
8846109 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
8846110 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
8846111 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
8846112 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
8846113 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
8846114 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity
8846115 gathering and colluding to commit a crime against national security
8846116 we are forced to hold our meetings trainings and seminars in our homes but the security forces have worked hard to prevent us from even holding meetings in our own homes meetings have been broken up and members have been arrested
8846117 nearly 50 were arrested and charged with vague security charges such as endangering national security or spreading of propaganda against the state
8846118 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
8846119 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
8846120 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardize the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives
8846121 in the absence of independent international monitors sri lankan civilians lack protection and remain at the mercy of two forces with long records of abuse

8846123 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
8846124 some of the people sentenced only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
8846125 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
8846126 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance with international law and the sudanese constitution which guarantees fair trials
8846127 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately

8846131 given the sophisticated optical systems in the two israeli tanks less than a mile away and the fact that the area is open and visibility was very good in full day light it is extremely difficult to believe that the soldiers would not have seen the clear tv press marking on both fadel shanas blue flak jacket and the reuter mitsubishi truck nearby
8846132 the need for a fully independent and impartial investigation into this killing is beyond question
8846133 indications that there are important needs in the region that still have to be addressed
8846134 here it is like war for us and back home it is war also there is no difference
8846135 we fled from death but death is after us we dont know what is happening to our relatives back home in camps for the displaced staying there would have been better than what happened to us
8846136 the egyptian authorities shameful treatment of sub saharan african migrants and vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees blatantly disregards international law we are calling for urgent intervention by president mubarak to end these abuses

8846144 i need your help with an issue that is affecting our soldiers sexual assault
8846145 weve been on the defensive concerning this crime and it is a criminal act
8846146 the army was focused on response now were going on the offensive were implementing a new prevention campaign
8846147 as the army moves out front in these efforts i need you to ask yourself and each other what can we do now to prevent sexual assault
8846148 its about bringing the team together being a leader looking out for our fellow soldiers and taking them under your wing to keep them safe our army values and the warriors ethos should make it a given
8846149 but to remind you and all our army soldiers i want to reinforce that its your duty as a soldier to
8846150 when you recognize a threat to a fellow soldier i expect you to have the personal courage to intervene and prevent sexual assault as a warrior and a member of a team you must intervene
8846151 as a brother a sister a fellow soldier it is your duty to stand up for your battle buddies no matter the time or place take action do whats right prevent sexual assault act
8846152 sexual assault goes against our army values and warrior ethos
8846153 i need you to intervene before an assault happens have the personal courage to take action and be motivated to make the program a success take ownership
8846154 stoning is a horrific practice designed to increase the suffering of those facing execution and it has no place in the modern world
8846155 we look to the iranian authorities to ensure that this dreadful punishment is never again used
8846156 the suspension of stoning is a welcome if long overdue step and a tribute to the courageous efforts of iranian human rights defenders
8846157 however an earlier moratorium on stoning executions was breached so we shall be watching closely to see that this does not happen again
8846158 it is really over to parliament which is currently considering proposed new penal legislation to reform the law and ensure that stoning executions are never again permitted
8846159 think about all the resources it takes to make those reusable cups

8846163 war crimes or crimes against humanity committed on the territory of georgia regardless of nationality of the perpetrator would fall within the jurisdiction of the international criminal court under article 12 of the rome statute of the international criminal court
8846164 georgia ratified the rome statute on 5 september 2003 russia signed the rome statute on 13 september 2000 while it has not yet ratified it it is bound not to defeat its object and purpose by committing war crimes or crimes against humanity
8846165 journalists as all other civilians in the conflict zone must be protected from hostilities
8846166 human rights monitors including from intergovernmental human rights bodies should be allowed full access to the conflict zone
8846167 moreover prior to the ceasefire there had been reports that humanitarian aid had been prevented from getting through to civilians trapped in the conflict zone
8846168 for example russian media reported that russian aid could not get through to tskhinvali on 11 august due to ongoing hostilities on 12 august the international committee of the red cross icrc stated that its access to south ossetia to deliver aid was being hampered by the intense fighting
8846169 we are also concerned that important questions of justice and impunity were not explicitly tackled in the mou suggesting that these issues will not be dealt with in the talks between the political parties
8846170 we add our voices to the increasing number of civic and political leaders activists and ordinary citizens in condemning the events in zimbabwe which have brought untold suffering to its people
8846171 the present government has brutally suppressed democratic dissent and persecuted political and human rights activists in callous disregard of the rights enshrined in the african charter on human and peoples rights
8846172 we value and admire her courage in telling us what happened to her events which have left her with irreparable trauma from both the physical and psychological torture she suffered
8846173 she corroborated events that the truth and justice commission had already been investigating we had heard of many cases but no one had wanted to give testimony as she has done
8846174 he said these words to me many girls have passed through here some left alive others werent so lucky he looked at me for a long time and said you are a very pretty girl please dont make me kill you
8846175 the first night was horrible no human words exist that can express the pain of that night my body was covered with bruises and bite marks a deep wound bled from my breast

8846178 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8846179 designed specifically to serve the growing entrepreneur and the home based and small business markets it is not only inspirational but also instructional in taking a balanced approach to success by offering guidance and insight into improving ones entire life
8846180 on the specific question of where packaged goods will go there are two factions but im clearly in the camp that doesnt think its going to go away before i retire
8846181 the reason why im so convinced is that ive always been saying our softare developers eat up storage space so much quicker than telcos can build distribution
8846182 i mean we used to be below 1gb but were now building games that have 8 9 10gb and if broadband distribution is going to allow 10gb to be distributed in half an hour well have games that are 100gb because the graphical resolution increases
8846183 the content size of games say need for speed the size of the open world that you can use increases so you just need more and more storage space which is going to again make the pipeline a big bottleneck
8846184 so i think there will still be a need for a physical distribution starter and then services and additional content can be distributed online
8846185 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended

8846200 this was the sixth olympic games ive attended and this by far was the least fun of any of them
8846201 you would see signs all over beijing one world one dream that was a bunch of baloney these games were chinas world and chinas dream
8846202 outside the venues there were no places to mingle no places to grab a sandwich or have a beer
8846203 not in beijing it became rather obvious after a while to me that the chinese government didnt want large groups to assemble near the venues because they were worried about protestors
8846204 you wouldnt believe how stark it was outside the birds nest beijings olympic stadium there was no place where you could find any shade no place to do anything i found the whole setting kind of depressing
8846205 first they wanted to show the world that they werent a third world country
8846206 secondly they wanted to show their citizens how great they were and lastly they designed the venues for their own citizens who wound up with most of the tickets it was very difficult for people from outside china to get tickets
8846207 id be watching cnn in my hotel room and suddenly the announcer would be saying something about china and the olympics and the screen would go black for a few moments
8846208 obviously the chinese censors perceived something negative being said about china and it simply wasnt allowed to be shown
8846209 and i heard if you went on google in beijing and tried to get information about darfur or tibet it wouldnt come up there was an english language newspaper id get at the hotel not usa today and everything in it was positive about the olympics not one negative comment whatsoever in the two weeks i was there not even by the guy who wrote a column
8846210 i saw michael phelps last three swims as well as misty may treanor and kerri walsh win their gold medal i saw some great things ill never forget
8846211 but outside the events the excitement just wasnt there to me these olympics were a total dud easily the worst ones ive been to
8846212 the consensus among those in the international water polo community is that tony azevedo now is the best all around player in the world
8846213 wonder how comfortable it is for long term gaming sessions
8846214 the ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for cash in our stores
8846215 im all for innovation but its tough when your customers dont have the money to pay for it
8846216 patients think they owe this money and it causes tremendous stress and anxiety for people
8846217 it is inappropriate to put the patient in the middle of this
8846218 position in china was stronger than what it was globally
8846219 they havent come up with the next generation product that replaces the razr
8846220 the guys that replaced it were nokia samsung and even lg
8846221 we try to make sure chinese early adopters are among the first to have our top of the line phones
8846222 we are the only ones with the technology to address the needs of all three of them
8846223 we took our eyes off the ball a little bit
8846224 they have a passionate base that they went after in a smart way
8846225 rights fees are up attendance is up viewership is up
8846226 somehow the strategy of putting baseball games on every device that has a plug or a battery has worked for the business partners even more important its worked for our fans
8846227 its much more than what you can get on television
8846228 it taps into the base by offering multiple camera angles stats and on demand video

8846242 chicago lawyer and onetime mega fundraiser joseph cari has advised biden and his campaigns on and off since 1984 serving in posts as varied as a senate adviser on crime to the midwest political director for bidens aborted 1987 presidential bid in 2005 cari helped arrange private meetings for biden with potential supporters as the senator explored another run for the white house he has also worked to raise money for biden
8846243 cari never attended those meetings however days before they were scheduled to take place he learned he was under investigation as part of the rezko probe and excused himself from the events a spokesman explained sunday
8846244 federal prosecutors indicted cari in august 2005 and in september cari cut a deal agreeing to cooperate with the governments investigation and pleading guilty to a count of attempted extortion
8846245 cari admitted that in 2004 he helped a rezko associate by making calls in what turned out to be a kickback scheme the deal was an offshoot of a complex corruption scheme wrought by antoin tony rezko whose ties to obama have vexed the white house hopeful cari has maintained he did not know the details of that scheme or any other
8846246 caris sentencing is delayed while he cooperates with the investigation he testified at rezkos trial earlier this year in which a jury found rezko guilty on 16 of 24 corruption related felony charges obama who entered into a complex real estate transaction with rezko and his wife in 2005 that appeared to aid the senator has returned nearly 150 000 in donations he received from rezko and his associates over the years

8846258 the recent incidents have really stripped off the veneer and reveal its not much different in kurdistan than other parts of iraq
8846259 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed tat preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8846260 it was a us proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraq one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq had the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops

8846275 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8846276 tonight tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8846277 at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8846278 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8846279 a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8846280 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8846281 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance
8846282 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8846283 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8846284 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built
8846285 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8846286 finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8846287 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made it clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8846288 you know john mccain likes to say hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8846289 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8846290 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore
8846291 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8846292 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8846293 this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8846294 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8846295 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8846296 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8846297 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8846298 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8846299 i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8846300 would be very pleased and proud of what the democratic party and our nation is on the brink of doing
8846301 i feel that he and my mother are looking down today with a great big smile on their faces
8846302 one of those moments where no matter how you assess it america is moving far from where its ever been
8846303 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8846304 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8846305 put middle class americans first again and reward companies who create jobs in america instead of shipping them overseas
8846306 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair

8846333 this deterioration of confidence is a sign that leaders arent meeting the needs of the organization
8846334 every business leader needs to take note of this if they want to grow their organization
8846335 great leadership doesnt happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than theyre getting now
8846336 this is scary considering the high rate of retirements were expecting over the next 5 10 years
8846337 organizations will have empty seats in key leadership roles if they dont begin planning for their future leadership
8846338 these arent good odds for programs that are supposed to increase success
8846339 organizations need to look at how theyre developing those individuals and identify why the failure rate is so high
8846340 when times get tough leadership skills are really put to the test and organizations with the right quality and quantity of leaders will weather the storm better than those less well prepared
8846341 in the face of pressure to reduce costs organizations must remain firm in their commitment to invest in leader assessment and development

8846361 there was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed
8846362 we know that four adults ate one cake made from this recipe and they didnt feel well
8846363 at first we thought this would be enough because we didnt really think anyone would bake or eat this cake since so much nutmeg would give it a horrible bitter taste and because it is simply not that easy to get hold of that much nutmeg

8846433 lately travel agencies have used the alluring name of bali to attract hordes of tourists for their round the world cruises that make a one day stop on the island
8846434 after going on a challenging and formidable journey as a sailor on a cargo vessel i arrived in java where i decided to jump ship
8846435 the people the sundanese and the javanese are so incredibly beautiful so delicately built brown and aristocratic that everyone who is not one of them should be ashamed
8846436 the dutch here are the most hateful and small minded people that one can imagine uncivilized haughty stupid boring arrogant
8846437 football is played with the feet and a goal basketball is played with the hands and a basket maybe we could invent a game played with the hands and a goal and call it handball omg can you imagine it would be so funny so funny ha ha ha ha ha ha hahahahahahahaha
8846438 im not sure how to do this question on electron path through an electric field
8846439 can you imagine if you were the funniest person in the world you would have to be
8846440 can you imagine an orange the size of the empire state building thered be so much juice
8846441 can you imagine an apple the size of the universe thered be so much apple
8846442 belakangan ini agen perjalanan wisata memanfaatkan nama bali untuk menarik minat rombongan turis yang ingin pesiar keliling dunia dan berhenti sehari di bali
8846443 setelah melalui pelayaran yang menantang dan berat sebagai pelaut di kapal kargo aku tiba di jawa dan memutuskan lompat dari kapal
8846444 orang sunda dan jawa itu menarik menawan hati berkulit coklat dan berpenampilan aristokrat membuat orang yang bukan dari golongan mereka merasa malu
8846445 orang belanda adalah orang paling picik angkuh dan tidak beradab sombong bengal membosankan dan arogan
8846446 people are starting to rethink what a healthy landscape looks like its not the trugreen chemical lawn anymore its a landscape thats more multipurpose that combines beauty and utility
8846447 i would love it the front yard of the white house we could get back to our roots
8846448 but weve had several cases where we had to tell people to cut vegetable gardens back residents were complaining
8846449 early presidents were responsible for providing for their own households and feeding dignitaries
8846450 but in general the history of vegetable gardening at the white house got lost because its so ordinary
8846451 most people dont realize that the victory garden program is a world war i program
8846452 her victory garden was a visible symbol that the family was pitching in doing their bit and making a sacrifice
8846453 i was watching my mother in law take things from their garden into the kitchen and transform them magically through the wonder that is belgian cuisine into things that were very very memorable to me
8846454 i was realizing that the europeans were really onto something when it comes to food
8846455 to pretend they can be a functional part of a front yard ornamental landscape is a stretch
8846456 bashing lawns as useless and environmentally unsound is a tired old story
8846457 a vegetable garden in front of the white house is a great idea and im really interested in history
8846458 whatd be really neat is to change the garden every couple of years to do something that celebrates the american history of gardening and what the presidents in the house and their first ladies may have done
8846459 thousands and thousands of people wrote mrs roosevelt personally describing their gardening experience or asking for seeds or tools
8846460 are you content to follow me just cleave and follow
8846461 if you were here winter wouldnt pass too slow and if you were here then id have a choice to live not be alone

8846475 this is the one weekend of the year that you can begin to imagine old sacramento as old
8846476 theres the final weekend of the state fair theres the greek food festival the rainbow festival country in the park a lot of activity but all of it outside of the old town the idea was to put a spotlight on history and see if it wouldnt draw visitors here
8846477 anytime youre bringing 120 000 people in its got to be good for the businesses
8846478 there was a confrontation on j street and shots were fired
8846479 half a dozen people were killed including the mayor when the sheriff went out to catch the culprits he was shot and killed too
8846480 we look to paul and the railroad museum to make sure what we represent is authentic
8846481 the gold panning the various camps the costumed characters theyre all historical entertainment supplements these things
8846482 one of the things that this event has lacked one of the few things is a place to get away from the action and relax a little
8846483 we dont want to make this thing a huge commercial event
8846484 because then it loses a large part of its charm
8846485 the event has had ethnic and cultural components for most of its history
8846486 were changing how its presented they used to be grouped all together but in the gold rush days it was all spread out there were making it a part of what you experience as you go through town more like the way it would have been encountered
8846487 were not even validating such an outrageous and preposterous claim with a comment
8846488 people spend hours and hours editing political ads i really dont see how this could go unnoticed by the editors maybe they saw it and thought it wasnt noticeable or maybe they thought it wasnt important
8846489 charter growth a skeptical public gradually embraces charter schools statewide

8846506 ya rasulullah engkau naik mimbar kemudian mengucapkan amin amin amin
8846507 hadits riwayat bazzar 3142 ahmad 2 254 dari jalan amas dari abu shalih dari jabir diriwayatkan oleh ibnu majah 1643 darinya secara ringkas dari jalan yang lain haditsnya shahih

8846509 sesungguhnya yang halal itu jelas dan yang haram itu jelas di antara keduanya terdapat perkara perkara yang syubhat samar yang tidak diketahui oleh orang banyak maka siapa yang takut terhadap syubhat berarti dia telah menyelamatkan agama dan kehormatannya dan siapa yang terjerumus dalam perkara syubhat maka akan terjerumus dalam perkara yang diharamkan

8846522 we understand that many advisors are feeling the squeeze at the moment its at this time that they should look to alternatives business types to bridge that revenue gap and help continue those relationships with their client banks pmi is one such business area
8846523 despite the current gloomy outlook were seeing enquiry volumes buck the trend and increase thats not to say there havent been changes in the nature of these enquiries were seeing increasing evidence of consumers shopping around now looking for better deals and perhaps more tellingly an erosion of brand loyalty in favour of affordability its just a shame that were not seeing advisors make more of this opportunity and offer pmi to their clients
8846524 clients are already shopping around for affordable pmi cover so this is a natural opportunity for the advisor to provide support to their client and if the advisor is not confident in this area then its a logical step to refer the business to a third party who can and will support it seems a wasted opportunity to leave clients to go directly to providers when the advisor could be at the heart of this process deliver an extra service to their client and at the same time access an extra revenue stream for their business
8846525 pmi is bucking the trend at the moment and advisers cannot afford to miss out on this hidden opportunity
8846526 we want our adopt a pet sm program to grow stronger in 2008 so we have invited the free spay society to take advantage of this petland corporate initiative locally
8846527 we devote some of our highly visible retail space at petland wesley chapel to showcase kittens fostered by the free spay society
8846528 its the right thing to do many community shelters are overloaded with litters of unwanted puppies and kittens and very often the professional pet industry is accused of helping to fill them i want to demonstrate that we at petland wesley chapel are part of the solution not a part of the problem the truth is that communities and shelters are overloaded with unintended litters from mix breed dogs and cats that people cannot afford to have altered i believe working with the free spay society will help change that
8846529 and i believe we need to help provide access to free or very low cost pet alterations to the people whose pets need it the most
8846530 our goal is to provide reimbursement or pre procedure vouchers to needy families that will cover or supplement the cost of having their pets spayed or neutered
8846531 petland wesley chapels generous donation of retail floor space will help us to help more pets and more pet owners i appreciate their generosity we the members of the free spay society have been helping pets with our own private resources but now we have officially organized and are in the process of applying for tax exempt status
8846532 individuals donors have the power to help us prevent the spread of canine reproductive cancer and to help the pets of low income families lead healthier happier lives to date our members have funded the spay or neuter of over 850 pets but together we can do more the free spay society receives no state or federal funding so our work depends completely on the generous donations of individuals
8846533 but i cant picture us still being beatles when were 30 years old
8846534 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word
8846535 ive never thought that much about age i mean ive always really liked chuck berry and he must be closing in on 50 by now
8846536 i dont think anybody would get real upset if they found out ill be 30 in a couple of weeks but why take a chance
8846537 shell kill me if you print this but our drummer is
8846538 did you see dave edmunds and rockpile at the roxy a couple of months ago or carl perkins at the whisky i didnt hear anybody calling them too old did you you could put four 59 year old men together and if they rocked like that nobody would call them old
8846539 throughout history men have been reaching their peaks at around 33 look at mozart and alexander the great and jesus if only people under 30 were allowed to play it it would be rocks loss
8846540 a couple of times when i was broke i had to join groups that were more like 9 to 5 punch in punch out jobs than music
8846541 but everybody kept asking me why i wasnt playing until i realized that i wasnt being true to my school as the beach boys would say that playing the guitar is what im really around to do
8846542 this is the last group ill ever be in full time if we dont get signed im going to find myself a nice well paying probably deathly boring job and live comfortably again ive done enough starving

8846550 going surfing is a big part of my creative process
8846551 surfing has always been a big part of my life ive surfed since i was nine years old leaving land is my favorite part of it i like being in a separate reality
8846552 its still my favorite thing to listen to a story through a song its like nothing else a song can preserve time and memory and history in a way that words or a picture alone cant a song can capture it all
8846553 it was a great time and a life changing time for me i felt like i had a peer group not only did i identify as far as politics and music but also age wise i had been with people because they were lesbian and women and we had a lot in common but they were all a lot older so for once i fit in where could a freak fit in in punk rock
8846554 so i came back from san francisco and the only people i knew here were lesbians and no way man i wanted punk rock i started going out to punk shows i would put on a little suit and tie and i would go there and try to look so cool though i didnt know a soul
8846555 he walks up to me and says hey want to be in a band
8846556 the fashions changed and the politics changed and people were wearing the swastika which they hadnt been up to that time because im jewish i would notice and it pissed me off so i wrote a song called take off your swastika it was right around the same time the dead kennedys wrote nazi punks fuck off i wrote the song as a direct personal reaction to the swastikas and i decided to play it on my acoustic guitar up til then id been playing electric guitar and synthesizer nobody in punk was really playing acoustic guitar at that time and the reason i did it was because i really wanted the words to be heard because as far as im concerned punk rock is the folk music of today though i didnt play it at some folk club i played it at punk rock clubs
8846557 people would yell and id get heckled and stuff but on the whole it was pretty great i remember playing at the whisky and seeing a couple of guys taking off their swastikas

8846605 it was an interesting three or four days leading up to the series i never thought id be anywhere near the games
8846606 they asked me where i was going to be in the winter and then i got a phone call saying ryan sidebottom was injured and they needed somebody so i said why not id never let them down

8846628 the story songs came out of conversations between pierre kaiser the dimes lead guitarist moog master and backing vocalist and i we work the same day job and usually eat lunch together i used to write boy girl songs like most pop writers but at lunch im always talking about stories i read in the newspapers pierre said why dont you write story songs theyd be better than the crap youve been bringing me lately i was already working on catch me jumping which is a true story about a friend who joined the navy he was out at sea and ended up jumping off the ship i think as a cry for help wed just been in japan playing shows on us bases including the one he was stationed to he was on a tight leash and had to check in with the guards before he could make any move it was a real story and the other guys in the band had such a positive reaction to it it got me addicted to the idea of story songs it was a combination of pierre telling me to get off my ass and stop trying to fit into some mold and my realization after writing catch me jumping that it could be a great thing i started working on the battle of san jacinto which i grew up hearing about in school in san antone i did some research and found out what both sides were experiencing and it was my first history song when i saw how much fun it was to write and how rewarding it was story songs became the story of the band for the next year and a half
8846629 pierre has an old house hes renovating which made it a perfect studio
8846630 he had isolated all the instruments in empty rooms and set up a studio in the basement we were going over for an all weekend session and when we showed up pierre had a stack of tattered newspapers on the kitchen table hed torn up the kitchen floor and under the floor someone had used these newspapers for insulation they were laid flat and in good shape we must have read then for an hour and the page he handed me was a world news page from the long gone oregonian daily journal it had headlines like reds riot in new york and man awake for 15 years cant pay his club bill and emmy destin dies in czechoslovakia i couldnt stop reading the man awake story was about captain paul kern who was shot in the head in wwi they saved his life but the bullet hit the part of his brain that controls sleep and fatigue he never slept again for the rest of his life he hung out at a club to find people to talk to at three in the morning i started singing paul kern cant sleep i stayed up all night and wrote paul kern i showed up for rehearsal the next day and played it and we all got excited we spent the day jamming on it and the parts came together i got three songs from that one page of newsprint we would have had fun making whatever album we would have made but after those newspapers it veered from one history song to three then seven more
8846631 we recorded and produced ourselves in our various bedrooms basements and attics using pro tools
8846632 but theres such a thing as being too perfect if we dont nail it in one take it goes out and we do it again i cant stand pitch correction i think relying on it is abusing the technology we usually play live over an acoustic guitar and vocal demo that i lay down with a click track so we get that live feel if you know what youre going for you can capture the raw element without sounding too digital
8846633 to follow a girl the age old story but were now married so it was a good move
8846634 i responded to an ad looking for a john lennon for a beatles tribute band and got the job but the band only lasted three gigs at the second gig i met pierre who invited me over to his house to jam with his roommate jake rahner who played drums we started getting together weekly after writing a few songs we put an ad for a bass player on craigs list and a few other sites and ryan showed up after we played one song with him we asked him to join
8846635 were aiming to have the next group of songs ready by early 09 when pierre told me he grew up in boston i started to research the city as if i were going on a trip boston was the center of early american history so i finished a boston song i had so much fun finding out about that history i thought maybe we should have a couple of boston tunes i wrote about the ride of paul revere in the first person and now i have 18 songs about people from boston or events that happened there clara barton who started the american red cross was from boston the sacco venzetti trial took place in boston and led to the riot i wrote about in new york 1930 the presiding judge in the case webster thayer had made up his mind before the trail that they were gonna fry and told his friends at his country club he was gonna throw the book at them they lost the trial and appealed but he was the appellate judge and denied their appeal five times which caused riots all over the world london new york moscow the chicago 1929 song was about the great chicago fire which was the biggest in american history but a year later in 1872 we had the great boston fire i wasnt planning to tie the new songs to the first record but i found all these connections when i started to investigate the history of boston its amazing how the threads of our history are so intertwined

8846649 i think ive paid my dues to be able to get in there and be able to have something thrown my way every now and then
8846650 to those people that say that i dont deserve the fight those are short timers and the ones that havent really followed the career of mma to know the guys that have been here a very long time and fighting when there was no money to now get an opportunity to fight and make some money
8846651 ive got a shoulder i had to replace ive got a knee i had to replace ive got a few broken bones in my feet and my hands
8846652 a bunch of stitches and all of that is attributed to the time ive put into the ufc and the times ive put into mma
8846653 me and a bunch of others have stepped in and made it possible we went through all the trials and tribulations of them trying to close it down and calling us animals and fought for practically nothing at one time because we love the sport
8846654 some guys in the fight world are saying that i stepped in front of them or this and that and hey i didnt do nothing but train and be a part of the history of the ufc and the history of mma and it got offered to me
8846655 tell me any jabroni that wouldnt take it if it got offered to them
8846656 to me its ridiculous because when youve got people that are talking like that who dont know the source dont know how things get started theyre just flapping their jaws you have know idea why this fight happened
8846657 this fight is happening because the organization needs a good fight they need something to go out there and sell tickets and draw people in

8846674 tentu saja tim rumania cluj tak bisa dikesampingkan walau saya tak tahu banyak tentang mereka tapi tim manapun yang bisa mencapai fase grup liga champions layak dihormati sehingga kami tak bisa meremehkan mereka kendati kami akan melakukan pekerjaan rumah tambahan menyelildiki tentang mereka
8846675 saya pikir anak anak sangat terfokus pada liga champions setelah mencapai empat semifinal termasuk satu final tetapi selalu hanya jadi pendamping juara saya pikir tahun ini determinasinya ada mereka sudah pernah berada di sana dan mencicipi bagaimana rasanya di final mereka sangat terfokus sampai final lagi tahun ini

8846681 allein die senkung der umsatzsteuer auf lebensmittel w rde die gemeinden j hrlich weit ber 80 mio euro kosten
8846682 ich habe verst ndnis daf r dass in einem wahlkampf intensiv um stimmen geworben wird
8846683 ich werde mich aber dagegen wehren wenn versprechungen zulasten dritter gemacht werden die gemeinden bekommen vom bund st ndig neue lasten und aufgaben aufgeb rdet viele w nsche des bundes m ssen am ende des tages von den gemeinden mit bezahlt werden
8846684 damals wurde vereinbart etwaige steuer nderungen nur im einvernehmen mit den fag partnern und nach wirtschaftlichen m glichkeiten durchzuf hren sollte die senkung der umsatzsteuer auf lebensmittel in der geplanten form beschlossen werden dann entfallen insgesamt 750 mio euro an steuereinnahmen nach dem verteilungsschl ssel des finanzausgleichs betr gt der anteil der gemeinden daran 11 713 prozent also mehr als 80 mio euro pro jahr
8846685 es ist immer noch so dass das gesamtstaatliche defizit 2008 ohne die wahlzuckerl rund 0 6 des bip betragen wird das sind mehr als zwei milliarden euro der gro teil dieses defizits wird von bund und l ndern verursacht die gemeinden erzielen als einzige den im stabilit tspakt verlangten berschuss
8846686 damit sind mit einem einzigen wahlversprechen alle zus tzlichen mittel aus dem neuen finanzausgleich f r die gemeinden weg
8846687 aus langer erfahrung als b rgermeister einer kleinen gemeinde kann ich allen parteien nur raten den w hlern nicht das blaue vom himmel zu versprechen
8846688 wenn man will dass die gemeinden auch in zukunft ihre aufgaben korrekt b rgernah und effizient erledigen dann kann man sie nicht um die finanzielle ausstattung daf r bringen
8846689 gute kinderbetreuung funktionierende pflichtschulen die w rdige betreuung und pflege lterer menschen u v m sind aufgaben die geld kosten die qualit t mit der diese aufgaben von den gemeinden erf llt werden ist in der bev lkerung anerkannt mit sinkenden steuereinnahmen werden wir diese qualit t allerdings nicht aufrechterhalten k nnen
8846690 gerade die gemeinden haben hier leidvolle erfahrungen weil nach abschaffung der getr nkesteuer f r handel und gastronomie die preise keineswegs gesunken sind die wirtschaft hat die damalige steuerersparnis nur vereinzelt an die konsumenten weitergegeben ich habe daher meine zweifel dass dies nun anders sein sollte

8846708 we are saddened to lose such a wonderful friend to our community and our love goes out to phyllis and her family during this most difficult time
8846709 we would not be at this incredible moment in history where all couples have equal rights under california law if it had not been for dels lifetime of courage and leadership our community will forever honor her life and legacy
8846710 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible
8846711 del martin slipped away from us just moments ago but her spirit and legacy will never be extinguished within the lgbt community
8846712 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8846713 i just found out about it right before i went up on stage and you know its hard to describe my respect and admiration for phyllis lyon and del martin what theyve done to change this country and to change peoples hearts and minds and to reconcile those that may be a little different than others but to humanize the lgbt community and to do what theyve done in advancing fundamental human rights is second to none and to hear that really one of the heroes of the civil rights movement in this country passed away and someone that i was privileged to marry just a few months ago was difficult for me and i know politicians arent supposed to get up there and show any emotions but it was human and real because she was an extraordinarily human person and a person of total authenticity and lived her life out loud and never took no for an answer and demanded equal justice and equal rights and she got it just a few weeks before she passed away

8846737 were not sure why this sudden boom occurred but we can speculate
8846738 the reason why i chose to go to acc over any other school was because it is the fastest way for me to become a longhorn while still receiving class credit
8846739 while acc has definitely helped to prepare me im ready to move on to a four year college with more opportunities to get involved
8846740 i wanted to join the rotc or a writing club community college just doesnt offer that
8846741 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8846742 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8846743 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8846744 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8846745 sites like facebook make it easy to disseminate a large amount of information to a large amount of people at a relatively low cost
8846746 obama is targeting the young vote very effectively and mccain needs to catch up on that
8846747 he has an older campaign that has to learn to change with the evolving media
8846748 its worse than last year but the states position hasnt changed
8846749 if something happens to you you may never be able to buy insurance after that at least on an individual basis

8846751 so where does this leave midnight sun my first feeling was that there was no way to continue writing isnt like math in math two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like with writing the way you feel changes everything if i tried to write midnight sun now in my current frame of mind james would probably win and all the cullens would die which wouldnt dovetail too well with the original story in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
8846752 president saakashvili has himself put an end to the issue of the territorial integrity of georgia
8846753 he left the south ossetian and abkhazian people no other choice but to ensure their security and their right to exist as independent states
8846754 what happened in south ossetia was an attempt of genocide on the ethnic basis
8846755 in order to compensate georgian losses of weaponry in south ossetia the west is ready to give georgia new tools for killing at the expense of its taxpayers

8846790 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
8846791 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can
8846792 the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible

8846796 asia remains a key strategic priority for our business and we have a very active plan to grow our operations in the region
8846797 investors continue to be stuck in that mentality that we need to get international exposure to avoid the u s slowdown and i think thats going to turn on itself maybe it is already

8846807 its not the billy ray cyrus mullet of the 80s
8846808 but if you are a young thin hipster kid there are incarnations that look really cool
8846809 hipper kids wearing more fashionable alternative versions of the rural mullet
8846810 you have to own the mullet to wear it right
8846811 he was wrong they all are theres no such thing as a good mullet
8846812 one thing this means is for republicans for once were probably not going to get outspent
8846813 it just shows that theyre very serious about winning this race
8846814 dino rossi did not knock this one out of the park
8846815 its an example of them having to bail a governor out a year and a half early
8846816 im sure gov gregoire has hit the big red panic button
8846817 while my earlier action to have the citys judgment claims fund pay this fine is legally defensible
8846818 it is clear that it is not politically acceptable and creates the appearance that i somehow feel that the citys ethics sanctions do not apply to me
8846819 that is not the case and not the impression that i want to give to the citizens of seattle
8846820 its my understanding the council is eager to close that loophole and we will provide whatever advice we can to support that
8846821 my position has been that if i showed no actual impairment what am i guilty of
8846822 however ive lost that battle and i concede that fact
8846823 has now established a nebulous or undefined precedent which troubles me i fear that the current standard is so vague that no one knows to which standard they are to be held accountable
8846824 we are working with our counterparts in russia in a cooperative effort and with other u s agencies
8846825 i think this is going to be an opportunity to have a real public discussion on this
8846826 by the marynarska business park we have acquired another profitable property for degi international in the biggest growth market of the european unions eastern european member states
8846827 this investment supports the strategic expansion of our portfolio as well as its profitability
8846828 we have been negotiating a joint venture with a potential partner for a number of months and i think that were pretty close i cant talk about the partner because the partner is a listed company
8846829 im optimistic we will sign a joint venture in the next four weeks
8846830 the department continues to gather and receive information the officers will remain on administrative leave
8846831 are certain that once all the facts are known the involved spog members will be vindicated and absolved of any wrongdoing

8846833 the grand jury mustve decided that mr smith having taken an oath to testify truly in a state proceeding stated intentionally and contrary to the oath a material matter which he knew to be false
8846834 we were not under the impression that any of the iron pigs had guns
8846835 we dont know more than anyone else about what that video showed
8846836 at this point the grand jury knows a great deal more about it than we do at loud american we have to trust the system
8846837 were sending the wrong message to the community through this federal law
8846838 we know that we have a lot of work to do
8846839 we have one group in one area that we really need to be concerned about
8846840 for me its less about being on the list and more about what we are going to do for those kids

8846847 it felt great being out there because its been so long since ive had live action in a game over seven months
8846848 it felt good to work the kinks out it was important for our starting offensive line to go out there together and get some valuable time before next weeks opener
8846849 it was important to get playing time for demetrius todd jared gaither and more snaps for adam terry
8846850 that means a lot going into the opener they knocked some of the rust off
8846851 dem vietnam veteranen mccain hielt er entgegen dass die demokraten nicht weniger patriotisch seien als die republikaner
8846852 zynische realit tsverweigerung ist ein untr gliches zeichen f r politische inkompetenz oft auch f r bevorstehenden untergang das insofern verr terischste zitat wird marie antoinette zugeschrieben der sp ter gek pften k nigin frankreichs die bauern sollten doch kuchen essen wenn sie denn kein brot h tten
8846853 das ist ein wichtiger schritt f r ein sozialeres klima in tirol
8846854 wir haben uns seitens der ak tirol ganz stark daf r eingesetzt dass diese soziale h rte in tirol abgeschafft wird was in anderen bundesl ndern m glich ist muss auch bei uns m glich sein ich habe dem landeshauptmann dieses anliegen vorgetragen gest tzt auf dutzende briefe und telefonate von betroffenen kindern die jetzt erzielte einigung zeigt dass in unserem land ein neues soziales klima m glich ist ein klima in dem das miteinander wieder im vordergrund steht im interesse der b rgerinnen und b rger unseres landes zu w nschen bleibt noch dass auch bei h rtef llen der ehepartner regress sozial vertr glich geregelt wird
8846855 die sp selbstbewusst und geschlossen in den intensivwahlkampf startet und das mit einem spitzenkandidaten werner faymann der den f hrungsanspruch der sozialdemokratie erneut unterstreichen wird

8846857 wir wollen sterreich moderner und sozialer gestalten genau deshalb ist es so wichtig dass wir als erster aus dieser wahlauseinandersetzung hervorgehen
8846858 wir werden zeigen dass jeder einzelne der 30 000 wahlhelferinnen voll motiviert und engagiert in diese wahl geht denn es geht um viel n mlich um ein sterreich in dem es faire chancen gibt und eine gerechte wohlstandsverteilung

8846861 thats one thing no one ever promised as a coach in the nfl its never smooth its never easy
8846862 i think joe has made the case that he can go back there and compete for us as the opening day starter
8846863 whether thats the best thing or where were at well have to see in the next three four or five days hes acquitted himself very well
8846864 even if we planned to name a starter we couldnt right now
8846865 well find out more about kyle in the next couple of days we dont know about troy well see what the next few days bring
8846866 it certainly wasnt our ideal to have a quarterback that very well could have been our starter miss all that time
8846867 so well have to factor that into the equation as we go forward by the same token hes had a lot of reps he knows our offense
8846868 we know that we have all the information on his shoulder and he is in the process of treating it with certain things
8846869 well know by the weekend whether he can throw it and be ready to go in a week
8846870 the great thing about it is i dont think i have to give out that information at this time so well get to you at another time
8846871 it was good to get in there and work with all of those guys
8846872 we moved the ball a little bit and were able to get the confidence of the offense up
8846873 he was in control he played faster and he was mostly on target he keeps making progress
8846874 if we get everybody back healthy we have a chance to do some great things this year
8846875 our second group was disappointing at the end of the second quarter you have to earn a ravens helmet some of those guys will make our roster decisions easier
8846876 we have opened on our own initiative an investigation under the treatys anti trust rules
8846877 we stock depends but we dont have any for babies
8846878 you can drive for 30 miles and maybe meet one or two cars
8846879 i couldnt even put a door on my house in new york without getting a permit
8846880 thats great news because theyre the ones who have kids
8846881 this is what weve been waiting to hear because those numbers have been going down for quite some time
8846882 an interesting contradiction is that in 2000 we ranked 15th oldest in the nation but we now are at 30th
8846883 there is not much you can do about it short of tying them up
8846884 it is best to aim a bit forward of the flys starting position to anticipate where it is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8846885 children are most at risk from disease and suffer physical and mental distress from being moved from their homes to relief camps
8846886 unicef focuses its response on delivering life saving supplies like medicines drinking water and sanitation equipment to ward off the threat of disease amongst the affected children
8846887 i felt like i was standing back there and nobody was within 10yards of me i felt ridiculously protected
8846888 we are starting to build the kind of chemistry that we need
8846889 we had a good week of practice this week and i think we will continue to come together the way were supposed to

8846891 marshalls interims demonstrate that whilst the public sector and commercial market has continued to be robust as would be expected the domestic market is becoming increasingly challenging
8846892 certainly thats our goal to have a successful resolution by the end of 2008
8846893 to bring continuity to the doj discussions rod parry our newly appointed chairman will be taking over the day to day management of the doj process freeing me up and allowing me to focus my efforts on daily operations
8846894 you just try to keep it from becoming a sideshow
8846895 weve tried to maintain an air of calm and sanity around the process this has not been as dramatic for us as choosing a vice president
8846896 but in the end its a very small victory compared to the victories i hope and plan to have throughout the year
8846897 as weve said to daniel hes still a very important part of this football team
8846898 we couldnt guarantee anything for his future we said look youre going to have to come out and play youre going to have to come out and compete and he was fine with it
8846899 the quarterbacks have to build their credentials with the players and thats done really long before practice starts during the offseason program
8846900 they build credibility with their work effort and their commitment and how they interact with their teammates so the players can root for all three of them and as a coach you can root for any one of the three to win the job
8846901 i do think when you settle on a quarterback i like to have things going in a direction
8846902 we couldve been 4 0 and if we lose to dallas in the opener sept 7 youre going to ask what went wrong
8846903 if you win most of your getaway day games youll be in the hunt
8846904 it was something i emphasized to the team during spring training
8846905 winning on the last day sometimes prevents sweeps sometimes puts you in a sweep position but most of the time it determines whether you win or lose a series because most series are three games
8846906 its the toughest game to play especially the last game of a trip guys think about going home after being on the road a long time 10 days this time i guess what you have to do is pretend youre not going home or not going to the next city if you win the majority of your getaway days i guarantee you youd be in the hunt
8846907 t hroughout the mediaeval period the role of the minaret oscillated between two polarities as a sign of power and as an instrument for the adhan call to prayer
8846908 it the minaret seems on the whole unrelated to its function of the adhan calling the faithful to prayer which can be made quite adequately from the roof of the mosque or even from the house top
8846909 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8846910 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8846911 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8846912 kita lihat bagaimana saat ini banyak rakyat yang menjadi korban pembangunan pariwisata hal ini harus mendapatkan perhatian serius dari gubernur yang baru

8846914 horse racing is a dangerous industry 89 per cent of jockeys have suffered at least one fall during their career that requires medical attention however most jockeys are not highly paid
8846915 89 of jockeys have suffered at least one fall during their career that requires medical attention
8846916 insurance for jockeys was almost unobtainable insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get its not a big working force where you can go insure 50 000 people or something like that
8846917 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8846918 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8846919 more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
8846920 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8846921 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8846922 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy

8846924 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8846925 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8846926 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8846927 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8846928 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8846929 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8846930 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8846931 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around

8846967 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying

8847004 it was a very tight match between us the last time and we feel that we were unlucky to lose it
8847005 actually all of the games that we have played against eachother this season have been pretty tight so this should be another cracking match
8847006 cork are a very good team with some excellent players and we know that it will be tough to break them down but weve been playing well in the last few games so we will be confident of winning it
8847007 in a way we can use the cup game as motivation to get revenge over them they knocked us out of the competition which was a big blow as we felt that we could have at least reached the final of it this year
8847008 the cup is over for us but we want to finish as high as we can in the league so we will be looking to get the win and it would be nice to get one over them at the same time

8847012 since i came to united theyve always been the team everyone wants to beat so were all used to that
8847013 and winning the double was a great achievement but were not satisfied with that
8847014 its something we all spoke about when we came back in pre season we want more trophies
8847015 we dont want to be known as a team which won the double and that was it we want to make history
8847016 hopefully in the next few years we will too i think we can do great things because weve got experienced players and young lads who can only get better
8847017 hopefully we will all keep learning keep playing well and keep winning trophies
8847018 in five or six years i hope people are saying what a great team we became
8847019 after that game the dressing room was a horrible place to be
8847020 no words were said and club wise its the worst ive ever been in
8847021 we realised that with the other teams who were left in the competition we would have had a great chance to win the fa cup it was really disappointing
8847022 the important thing was to keep that feeling at the back of your mind and make sure we went on to win the premier league and champions league

8847041 you wonder how much sense it makes to segregate or separate elected officials

8847043 the citizens of north carolina expect you to have common sense

8847064 i dont want someone living that close around my family and other families either
8847065 you need to worry about your friends and family you let around your children more so than stranger danger

8847097 we need to re establish in australia that teaching is a great profession and a great calling for the best and brightest of our university graduates
8847098 we have already witnessed in the last one year primarily these steel prices were the major ingredient for all these steel companys stock prices to go up but in the last one month what we have witnessed is they have sharply come up their highs across the globe so they will be under pressure only very few companies who have very integrated raw material and in the best kind of raw material management though companies are working on that but with this kind of a price suddenly the input costs are rising and demand has also started decreasing because of the higher price regime so everything put together this sector will remain under pressure and plus domestically also there is some kind of a government intervention because of the inflation pressures so i feel that a very low upside is on tata steel from these levels probably if somebody is holding on to it and it gaining some money we can trade during frequent intervals either go long short at times but booking profit at these level is advisable
8847099 for tata steel rs 565 570 is a very strong support but the idea here has to be a trading move so once you can get past the rs 625 627 level we could probably be in a good market where steel is coming back at rs 700 but those are the levels one needs to book profits at and again try to look to get back around rs 565 570 i dont think steel is likely to make new highs from here

8847144 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8847145 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger

8847315 the project would require about 600 650 acres for tata motors and 300 350 acres for about 60 70 suppliers or about 1000 acres for the entire cluster this is a misplaced view that 351 acres of the suppliers area are in fact vacant and that this area is planned to be used for commercial purposes this has never been our intention

8847318 i have to ask the question whats going to make it worthwhile for me to make a very good example of another cop corruption movie
8847319 we started saying to each other that the institutional lying at the center of
8847320 yet he reaches a moment where he says im going to distribute a disc with the pictures because they show a corruption of the things were supposed to be standing for for an actor thats an incredibly interesting tension
8847321 my dad retired from the nypd as a detective sergeant
8847322 my uncle was a cop my mothers father was a cop there are a lot of things we got right in the script including having cops talk as cops talk
8847323 but when edward got on board he was great about challenging me pushing me
8847324 edwards very involved in a positive way most actors are just concerned with the role he needs to know how his work fits into the piece as a whole he needs to understand the whole puzzle and how his character tentacles out into the other pieces
8847325 theyre all by sidney lumet for me the lumet movie that stands out from that bunch is serpico because that was the police corruption film for its generation frank serpico was the hippie cop who spoke to the counterculture
8847326 how words like pride and glory and patriotism are used to co opt my generation into participating in things that it knows are not right and when you frame something that way to me it starts to rise above genre
8847327 edward works like an investigative journalist or an archaeologist when he digs into a role he doesnt play ray as a cliche but as a compassionate troubled internally struggling guy
8847328 that was more the fun of seeing whether you could make a film that makes you feel the way those comics did when you were a kid as if youre entering a slightly illicit fantasy world
8847329 whenever i hear an actor say his character wouldnt do something i have to laugh
8847330 because for me when im working on a character and he starts to do contradictory things thats when i know were in the zone of truth
8847331 we have established that all types of antipsychotics carry an increased risk although the risk might be somewhat higher with the second generation drugs

8847351 what is so surprising about these sculptures is firstly their sheer modernity and secondly how distinguished and distinctive they are in their place in the history of chinese art and chinese buddhist sculpture i still when looking at these now familiar sculptures am struck by their innovation and their moving interpretation of spiritual and human values
8847352 in sponsoring the lost buddhas exhibition we are pleased that we have helped bring such a majestic array of sculpture from china to sydney

8847361 i thought we know what happens to actresses in their 40s and 50s

8847367 andreas has the enthusiasm for his subject that explodes into your subconscious mind and really makes nlp real for me i recommend this training for everyone who already thinks that they are great because they will realise just how much better they will be
8847368 the best blogs have a tinge of obsession about them
8847369 a big hit on the web one of londons obsessives
8847370 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8847371 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8847372 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8847373 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8847374 oh it will just feel like you bit your tongue

8847380 us still working on revised draft and india still demanding
8847381 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8847382 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8847383 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground
8847384 there are signs however that the process of developing a revised draft is taking so long that the other 44 members will not have sufficient time to analyse the proposal and work through their respective national political processes to enable them to take a decision by next week
8847385 some indian officials and commentators have suggested that new delhi may walk away from the deal if the nsg establishes hyde act like requirements if that occurs so be it
8847386 the indian governments demands have been so unreasonable that the bush administration simply cant ram an india specific exemption through the nsg without accepting substantial changes and some common sense restrictions and conditions
8847387 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8847388 have stuff we need to sort out on our own

8847392 hatten die polen etwa nicht das recht in die nato einzutreten oder gibt es nur ein recht auf imperium

8847394 we were watching tv and all the sudden the house shook and the first thought was someone was going about 200 300 miles an hour and hit the side of our house
8847395 first we heard a big boom and then the whole building shook and the glasses started falling and everything so we ran outside to see if anything had hit the building because thats what it felt like we went outside and we didnt see anything and then my manager said look behind us and we saw this big ball of fire and smoke going up in the air
8847396 incluyen aunque no s lo municipios de bosnia y herzegovina

8847405 a veces hasta siento culpabilidad de venir de esta manera y que otros vengan de otra
8847406 me gustar a preguntar al distinguido representante de estados unidos armas de destrucci n masiva las habeis encontrado ya en irak o a n est n busc ndolas
8847407 no soy un psic logoy no se que le ha llevado a esa libre asociaci n que escuchamos del embajador churkin
8847408 eso es bien sabido pensabamos que estaba superado pero no hay una ambici n territorial o deseo de desmembrar a irak
8847409 me temo que esa afirmaci n embajador churkin simplemente no se sostiene
8847410 talking through the language of the bullet should be stopped
8847411 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8847412 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8847413 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8847414 if my suspicions are confirmed in that case the suspicion arises that somebody in the united states has intentionally created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8847415 this is as we told the union leadership this morning our best shot
8847416 the best package of pay and benefits in the aerospace industry
8847417 theyre still going through it every detail line by line
8847418 so even a small disruption of a week or two can cause a slippage in the delivery schedule

8847422 ich verstehe schon ich bin nicht der typische pr sidentschaftskandidat ich bin anderer herkunft und ich habe nicht mein ganze karriere in washington verbracht aber ich stehe heute abend vor euch weil bei uns etwas in bewegung ist
8847423 harry has made no secret of the fact he wants to be there when the regiment returns to the front line next year he said the experience of leading his men into battle is one he hopes he can repeat
8847424 and with one mission under his belt he has the skills and experience that will make him an extremely valuable member of the battle group
8847425 prince harry is committed to his career in the army and he remains ready to do whatever iss required
8847426 i dont want people to do jobs i want them to become entrepreneurs
8847427 everyone must do any bussiness whether big or small and blogging is one of them

8847433 john mccain steht allein mit seiner eigensinnigen weigerung einen schlecht gef hrten krieg zu beenden
8847434 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid
8847435 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8847436 the governments failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8847437 but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8847438 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8847439 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8847440 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8847441 it was not an elegant speech but that may have been on purpose
8847442 his attacks on mccain were pretty tough and thats the one element of his speech where he was in danger of conflicting with his brand
8847443 en las ma anas se ha planteado una batalla muy bonita pero de alto riesgo porque cada vez se concentran m s profesionales de prestigio en esa franja
8847444 lo que en principio era una desventaja se ha convertido en una virtud ya que sabemos adaptarnos a la actualidad y hacer un programa pegado a ella
8847445 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8847446 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8847447 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8847448 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8847449 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording

8847457 we want to rework our ability to open shelters without closing school prematurely
8847458 i want to try to find a way to do a better job informing people as to the progress of power restoration
8847459 honoring and respecting the chain of command making sure everyone e in the emergency operation centers goes through the proper process so that good decisions are made and we way the level of the need with the available for help
8847460 i think well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it obviously
8847461 but it is also an opportunity to play anderson back from the olympic games nani whos available from suspension and if possible gary neville i think those three will all figure in fridays game
8847462 patrice evra and wayne rooney will also be involved after that it depends whos back from injury if owen hargreaves has maintained his training performances he will play i think well play a strong team but therell certainly be some changes
8847463 hes not one of my closer friends but theres still conversations i guess hes alright
8847464 its been a long time since ive been able to relax and have a sleep in im looking foward to sitting on the couch and hopefully watching the eagles win on the weekend
8847465 she didnt look too good in brisbane and was coughing up a lung pretty much hopefully she can get better in the next few days and get back out there

8847468 this one man show cannot sustain as one person cannot physically be the party head de facto pm de jure president party strategist economic czar wheeler and dealer manpower manager political mastermind this all in one approach was detrimental to the country
8847469 what if our forces in swat or fata refuse to fight any more because of lack of will and political support where would that take the country and who will stop the onslaught of the taliban then
8847470 because you will not be able to handle it because it will be too much for everyone to swallow and digest so quickly because if you fail you will bring the entire political system down
8847471 they were asking for restoration of the judges on nov 2 position and that would have offended the mqm who would destabilise sindh
8847472 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still number one and the best youre going to be there again and stuff
8847473 so i feel like ive got unbelievable support from the fans watching me and seeing people in the streets and stuff its really nice
8847474 mindestens einen punkt m ssen wir aber holen denn bremen hat im borussia park noch nie gewonnen und wir haben gut 50000 fans im r cken

8847481 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was seven or 10 years ago
8847482 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google hasnt at least from what i read about them evolved to that
8847483 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
8847484 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
8847485 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
8847486 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing
8847487 cest une jeune dame qui vient darriver au gouvernement et qui se trompe
8847488 je ne vais pas fuir je pr f re rester et lutter et de toute fa on on peut faire autre chose que quitter le gouvernement on peut par exemple bloquer tous les dossiers de lopen vld

8847500 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8847501 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighbouring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8847502 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8847503 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8847504 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8847505 the active role of russia in promoting peace and co operation in the given region
8847506 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8847507 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8847508 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8847509 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts
8847510 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8847511 i ask people why they have deer heads on their walls they always say because its such a beautiful animal there you go i think my mother is attractive but i have photographs of her
8847512 take a good long look at yourself and see how stupid you are
8847513 the child is happy that mommy and daddy made up
8847514 i dont blame you for being you but you cant blame me for hating it so say what are you waiting for kiss her kiss her i set my clocks early cause i know im always late
8847515 we admit that we are like apes but we seldom realise that we are apes
8847516 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8847517 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8847518 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8847519 to make the euro a bigger player in global financial markets as the dollar wanes
8847520 shoring up her legacy before the bush administration leaves office
8847521 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8847522 operations will not resume until such time as measures are implemented to the satisfaction of the department which will eliminate excessive fugitive emissions from the site
8847523 in football soccer its the other way round if our english qualified figure starts to fall then that will begin to affect the national team there can be no question that is starting to happen in soccer
8847524 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8847525 this is going to be a speech that is going to be remembered along with a handful of other great ones in the past
8847526 the general nature of this election is just a high wattage election in the extreme and the democrats putting this together as they did moving to the stadium with the fireworks i think they did well i dont think he could have done any better
8847527 any party in any election year would very much like to be able to replicate it for the party that didnt do it theyre going to have to do what you would expect them to do which is to find some way to depreciate what happened
8847528 its like saying well the only reason that you guys on the colorado rockies have so many home runs is because the air is so thin well please
8847529 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8847530 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8847531 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship
8847532 still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8847533 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8847534 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8847535 what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8847536 i believe even if you are opposed to a certain point of view that you can listen to it
8847537 barack obama gives me cause to look at him with a little more attentiveness and with a bit more of a critical eye he said some very intriguing things tonight
8847538 he cast a large net out to include a lot of things that certainly concern me
8847539 does not minimize his very very strong appeal in other areas
8847540 would i vote for him if it was today no but lets see what happens in six weeks
8847541 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8847542 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8847543 this one was definitely over the wall this was a great presentation i loved it it touched me it made me want to be better than i am
8847544 it made me want to get engaged again and go off and do things for america
8847545 yes government must lead on energy independence but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient
8847546 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we also must admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework
8847547 i thought barack obama who names their kid barack obama
8847548 i think it actually takes more concentration to do it well
8847549 you have to line it up with the runway and you have to do that without sitting right there
8847550 i have a desk job and when you sit at the computer you dont have a lot of evidence of anything concrete
8847551 sometimes its nice to work on a project and have something right there at the end of the day
8847552 you have to take a closer look but once you do you can see its not a little airplane
8847553 once they see the caliber its pretty clear its not just a toy
8847554 that made it hard to really learn how to fly because if you spend six months laboring on it youre afraid to fly it
8847555 you can build if you want to build but really for most the flying part is what tickles your fancy
8847556 now you can have 10 20 people together at the same time
8847557 you have to reverse them when its flying right at you
8847558 you would have these 20 pound airplanes flying into a building at 60 mph
8847559 i think i can sit there and imagine myself flying and wondering if id be airsick if i was doing all the skills that some of those pilots can do and i think i would be
8847560 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8847561 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8847562 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8847563 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8847564 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8847565 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8847566 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8847567 this is going to be a speech that is going to be remembered along with a handful of other great ones in the past
8847568 the general nature of this election is just a high wattage election in the extreme and the democrats putting this together as they did moving to the stadium with the fireworks i think they did well i dont think he could have done any better
8847569 any party in any election year would very much like to be able to replicate it for the party that didnt do it theyre going to have to do what you would expect them to do which is to find some way to depreciate what happened
8847570 its like saying well the only reason that you guys on the colorado rockies have so many home runs is because the air is so thin well please
8847571 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8847572 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8847573 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship
8847574 still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8847575 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8847576 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8847577 what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8847578 i believe even if you are opposed to a certain point of view that you can listen to it
8847579 barack obama gives me cause to look at him with a little more attentiveness and with a bit more of a critical eye he said some very intriguing things tonight
8847580 he cast a large net out to include a lot of things that certainly concern me
8847581 does not minimize his very very strong appeal in other areas
8847582 would i vote for him if it was today no but lets see what happens in six weeks
8847583 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8847584 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8847585 this one was definitely over the wall this was a great presentation i loved it it touched me it made me want to be better than i am
8847586 it made me want to get engaged again and go off and do things for america
8847587 yes government must lead on energy independence but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient
8847588 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we also must admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework
8847589 i thought barack obama who names their kid barack obama
8847590 jab koi baat bigad jaaye kahi koi muskil aa jaye tum dena saath mera oh hum nawaz
8847591 ho chandni jab tak raat deta hai har koi saath tum magar andhere me na chorna mera saath
8847592 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8847593 when its calvin klein and its steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it

8847595 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze

8847611 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8847612 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8847613 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8847614 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8847615 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8847616 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home

8847659 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8847660 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8847661 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8847677 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8847678 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8847679 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8847680 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8847681 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8847682 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8847683 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8847684 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8847685 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8847686 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
8847687 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8847688 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8847689 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8847690 now wall street is finally paying attention heck the release of the second quarter qbp was a major media event cnbc covered it live why
8847691 insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported net income of 5 0 billion for the second quarter of 2008 this is the second lowest quarterly total since 1991 and is 31 8 billion 86 5 percent less than the industry earned in the second quarter of 2007
8847692 loan losses registered a sizable jump in the second quarter as loss rates on real estate loans increased sharply at many large lenders net charge offs of loans and leases totaled 26 4 billion in the second quarter almost triple the 8 9 billion that was charged off in the second quarter of 2007 the annualized net charge off rate in the second quarter was 1 32 percent compared to 0 49 percent a year earlier this is the highest quarterly charge off rate for the industry since the fourth quarter of 1991
8847693 the industrys ratio of reserves to total loans and leases increased from 1 52 percent to 1 80 percent its highest level since the middle of 1996 however

8847721 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8847722 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8847723 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8847724 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8847725 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8847726 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8847727 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8847728 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8847729 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8847730 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8847731 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8847732 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8847733 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8847734 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8847735 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8847736 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8847737 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8847738 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8847739 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8847740 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8847741 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8847742 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8847743 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8847744 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8847745 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8847746 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8847747 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8847748 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8847762 so fake us marshal fake credit cards you got anything thats real

8847764 ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8847765 amid thin trading it is a given never to find yourself in short positions
8847766 if this news were fully taken into account oil should be up by more than 1
8847767 the market is responding calmly i dont think the market is seriously picturing that such a big sanction as reported is on the horizon
8847768 computers used to take up entire buildings now they just take up our entire lives
8847769 so how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire and the honest answer is this you wont and accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience
8847770 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8847771 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8847772 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8847773 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8847774 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8847775 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8847776 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8847777 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8847778 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8847779 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8847780 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8847781 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8847782 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8847783 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8847784 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8847785 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8847786 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8847787 who are open to doing something on the production side
8847788 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8847789 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8847790 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8847791 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8847792 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8847793 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8847794 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8847795 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8847798 ich denke worauf es uns wirklich ankommt ist die tatsache dass das spiel f r neulinge nicht zu einsch chternd wirkt
8847799 sofern wir weiter die maximale levelgrenze erh hen und dabei nicht zur ckgehen und die zeit anpassen die man vom anfang bis zum ende ben tigt w rde das spiel unserer meinung nach zu einem hindernis f r leute werden die neu einsteigen und mit ihren feunden spielen wollen
8847800 ich denke viele aus unserer aktiven community erstellen neue charaktere wodurch diese ebenfalls von diesen nderungen profitieren
8847801 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8847802 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8847803 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8847804 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8847805 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8847806 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8847807 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8847808 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8847869 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward

8847891 they should continue vetting their staffs instead of doing it once this will help them to insure safety in their banks
8847892 we want the judiciary to refund peoples money as a matter of urgency they should put an advert in the media inviting claimants to be paid because bail money is claimable
8847893 this matter is complex and thats why we are in touch with the auditor general and the accountant general to sort out this problem
8847894 we have some magistrates who misuse bail money but the major problem has been inadequate funding for court operations
8847895 we have names for those from 2006 to date the rest we dont have and its a problem mr chairman

8847921 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

8847925 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8847926 absolutely spent was i thinking about leaving him in i definitely had a thought about it but i knew there definitely was no sense in sending him back out
8847927 this is our time to hold these leads this is our job were not getting it done right now
8847928 it would be kind of interesting wouldnt it to play for the nlcs title right here
8847929 burying the 2008 yankees has become too darn easy like practicing layups on an eight foot rim or beating a 4 year old at checkers
8847930 if you are a yankee in 2008 the red sox are your daddy
8847931 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8847932 after we had returned to school from a parade and turned in our uniforms and changed our clothes mr d would stand at the top of a flight of stairs and personally call by name and congratulate each band member as they left school
8847933 he was greatly admired and his classes werent a competition for grades they were simply enjoyable
8847934 he inspired us to play well and sound good and all of the students respected and admired him
8847935 they got about 100 people from the 1950s through the 1980s to come
8847936 and it was the push i needed to start playing the clarinet again i had stopped about 20 years ago
8847937 i didnt know i had a day off until i saw the situation taking place
8847938 in my mind i thought i was going to face somebody in the eighth but i just work here they know what theyre doing hopefully in september well have extra bullets in our arms
8847939 sometimes they are smarter than we are we just go with our energy and adrenaline im never going to second guess my manager hes the boss if he feels i need a day off so be it but as athletes we like to be out there every day but we still have a few days before september im pretty sure once september arrives you might not see that happen
8847940 hopefully ill be able to finish up strong for them
8847941 i dont know i looked in the stands the whole time
8847942 dubee already told me are you ready to lead the pitchers meeting im not a whole lot of help a couple of the hitters asked how this guy is going to pitch them how is this pitcher going to try to strike me out try to get you to swing and miss three times chase thats what i told chase last night
8847943 they are the bosses they are the ones that run the team and they know what is best for us
8847944 sometimes we just have to stay back and watch even though as an athlete you are very competitive and you want to be there every time but its not that easy we play 162 games and they are trying to do what is smartest for the team so when september comes we can all be ready to go
8847945 all you can do is keep your fingers crossed and do what you can do
8847946 his past three or four times out there down there i understand he was throwing real good
8847947 his command was good he was pitching much better we figured that that is going to be pretty tough on him to pitch him 2 or 3 days in a row
8847948 i dont want to say i wasnt wanted but i kind of got dismissed
8847949 but the best thing is he didnt send me somewhere that doesnt mean anything he sent me to a playoff contending team and ill be forever grateful
8847950 to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our lineup did against ryan dempster
8847951 it was one of those days where it wasnt going where i wanted it to go
8847952 we got in a situation where we couldnt get people out
8847953 now we have to play the mets head to head theyre must wins
8847954 its no secret were running out of time theres no margin for error
8847955 that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to understand
8847956 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm

8847958 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8847959 sergej alexander munkvold f dt 1979 er leder for ivar aasen sambandet og dermed den norske h gnorskbevegelsen
8847960 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8847961 obviously were not trying to prevent the hospital from providing care
8847962 strikes are always a difficult situation for everyone involved but we are comfortable the proposals we have offered to the union so far have been very fair and equitable
8847963 we are well on track with the 45nm plan as we have been telling this group about in the past we have actually started production late last quarter and are on track to start buying shipments early in q4
8847964 i wouldnt trust that site if my life depended on it
8847965 officials from amd did not comment on the news story
8847966 we are well on track with the 45nm plan as we have been telling this group about in the past we have actually started production late last quarter and are on track to start buying shipments early in q4
8847967 if they are just carrying a few palestinians that is not a problem
8847968 during this whole trip to gaza the only time i was generally scared was in an israeli prison
8847969 more than 40 000 are living in government run camps
8847970 we have seen panic weve seen sorrow weve seen despair hundreds of people screamed to us from rooftops as we floated by
8847971 but there are simply too many people to rescue and too few boats to do so people were literally screaming waving running with suitcases in water trying to get to us
8847972 we agreed on 2 000 rupees and he upped it to 2 700 61 just like that
8847973 its raining here people are on rooftops begging to be rescued
8847974 we are hungry were thirsty we have to drink something
8847975 the more surprising the lies the easier they are to expose
8847976 drepung the largest tibetan monastery and once home to as many as 10 000 monks is now a re education camp for monks involved in the march 14 uprising
8847977 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8847978 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8847979 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8847980 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8847981 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8847982 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8847983 will not enter his plea to the indictment until the new one which he will be judged upon is finished
8847984 we will ensure that it reflects the current case law facts already established by the court and evidence collected over the past eight years
8847985 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8847986 i want the same justice for every marine sailor soldier serving in harms way
8847987 you dont know what combat is until youre in combat
8847988 its an extraordinary situation and there just wasnt enough evidence
8847989 people heard the shots but nobody saw who did the shooting thats not enough
8847990 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8847991 is the deadline that most of the registrars have given us to place measures on the ballot
8847992 i frankly negotiated in good faith for as long as we can and if the governor can get a couple of republican votes then we have a budget
8847993 in legislation the devil is in the details we will be analyzing the plan thursday night but at this point it does not appear to be something republicans can support
8847994 not only do i think its a bad idea but makes me wonder what has the governor and don perata done the last several months to come up with this
8847995 ugly ugly this is not a budget that anybody likes
8847996 i dont like it because it doesnt do enough to sustain the level of service that i believe the state needs to be committed to support its human infrastructure but its the best we can get done
8847997 we need to monitor all our personnel related costs to make sure we are managing our resources well
8847998 at the same time overtime in many cases is required to ensure the continuity of our service to the public such as dealing with hospital or safety emergencies or other situations where it makes more sense economically to pay someone overtime than to hire additional permanent staff
8847999 in the long run it would be more economically sound not to have that overtime bump
8848000 overtime should be an exception it should not be the rule
8848001 kayani is moving in that direction im pleased that hes moving in that direction and that he is actually operating kayani is undertaking operations that were not ongoing a few months ago
8848002 we have got to figure out how to get at this problem
8848003 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8848004 dit is beslist geen kunstwerk maar een godslastering en een walgelijk stuk vuil dat veel mensen ziek maakt zei pahl gisteren
8848005 kwetst de religieuze gevoelens van zoveel mensen die in het kruis het symbool van gods liefde zien
8848006 kunst moet altijd vrij zijn en de kunstenaar moet geen beperkingen in zijn vrijheid van expressie hebben zei claudio strinati van de staatsmusea in rome gisteren tegen een italiaanse krant
8848007 there will be laughter there will be tears and youll learn something about how we can turn the outcome of this disease if we just set our minds to it
8848008 people can call in and talk to their favorite celebrity
8848009 and she said in english wow are you a real norwegian she was so thrilled to see me ive never felt so special in my whole life
8848010 as a city were interested in becoming a first tier cultural center
8848011 that entails opening up and seeing whats happening out there and bringing to philadelphia the best and most interesting work available and it works both ways it also means exporting some of the great thinking were doing in culture
8848012 i feel all countries all cultures all nationalities emphasize their specialties up to a point where you start to forget that people are actually the same anywhere you are
8848013 through this performance im giving the finger to people who want to be so special and want to withdraw from the common society
8848014 its a major tendency in contemporary times and its especially interesting here in the states where everybody has roots from somewhere and very often people identify strongly with those roots
8848015 if youre born in the u s a and grew up in philadelphia you have nothing to do with your old country its just a myth but i know norwegians living in the midwest whove never been to norway but theyre more norwegian than me theres something wrong here
8848016 put ourselves in a position to be the butt of some jokes and the object of some rancor
8848017 it would be really easy to dismiss the show as being look at the funny americans talking about europe but i really think its more of a human tendency to be fascinated with strange customs the semaphore or the smoke signals of a distant culture
8848018 ive also been on backpacking trips in europe where all anyone was interested in at that given moment was finding a mcdonalds so were trying to play with anthropologizing the idea of discovering all these strange truths while holding on very tightly to what we already know and how willing we are to step outside of our comfort zone
8848019 the image of america from swedens point of view is that youre a pretty right wing religious bunch of people
8848020 so this has been an exploration for me to find the other side of america it was the opposite for my great grandfather and joe hill when they came here because there were pretty radical things going on back then politically the story is really religion and politics and can they blend i dont know if they belong together and i dont know where to look for the answers
8848021 i feel like the play that we made is not like either of our existing plays
8848022 we pushed on each other and ended up at a third point which i think was kind of important to us we wanted to do something different from what we usually do
8848023 perhaps the most important thing in theater is to create an atmosphere on stage a new logic
8848024 if you do that the audience will feel that theyve entered a room they havent been in before and they open their senses and are ready to take whatever text or action there is
8848025 i dont want to do something trendy or good work in a certain method i just want to make the actors get into my world if they manage that then automatically we will become original or new in a way thats something i often miss personal work in theater or movies i want to see that there is a sick mind behind things
8848026 when the cast of the show must go on travels
8848027 we are 24 people making some long flights around the world in the past two years the issue of climate change became very intense to me that is why i started to think about how to go showing this piece without spending so much energy and producing co2 i decided this piece should be given to companies around the world so we will save some energy
8848028 here i can make use of all my american references
8848029 i can explain a scene by recalling an episode of seinfeld and they get it and finally i get to work leave it to beaver into a piece
8848030 the age at which children start with donald duck magazine went from 6 to 8 years old in the last few years the magazine turns out to be too difficult for many 6 and 7 year olds children read less these days thats why we wanted to develop a magazine that is much simpler and with which children learn to read while having fun
8848031 an amoebic structure thatll morph around various architectural sites around the city
8848032 what would kinky do how to unscrew a screwed up world
8848033 a life sized insect who can visit dreams and speak to the dead
8848034 klein had been moving in and i hoped to trap him in a big pot
8848035 while it was possible steve had a big pair i knew he was an advanced player and it was possible he was trying to pick up the pot with a squeeze play
8848036 leading out here would have likely caused steve to fold overcards but if he had a real hand hed probably raise and put me in a tough spot
8848037 a check raise would be a much scarier scenario for steve so i decided to go for it
8848038 the way the hand came down pre flop i figured he had to know this flop was right in my wheelhouse
8848039 my flat calling both kleins raise and steves re raise cried out middle pair or middle connectors i knew he couldnt call my all in with overcards and that there was a decent chance hed suspect a set and lay down a strong hand like an overpair i call this the threat of the set
8848040 when a player makes a big move against a players strong pre flop raise his opponent must consider that hes up against a set it can be a good bluffing opportunity
8848041 first we pray then we sing then we listen to the sermon
8848042 worshipers should not take a passive attitude toward worship such as we usually take toward entertainment worship is a priestly service it is latreia labor service therefore we should go to church to do something to bring praise to god and to minister to one another
8848043 finally it is a clear fact that our goodwill has gotten us to the point where our enemies are making a mockery of us
8848044 it was a slow steady project a lot of the arrangements were worked out on tour
8848045 one of our best wholesalers had been bugging us youve got to make a pumpkin beer
8848046 i was just scratching my head it wont last i thought the wholesaler was just jumping onto a trend
8848047 its developed a following all its own and you have to say its on merit not just for kicks
8848048 the essential reference of domestic brewers and their bottled brands
8848049 tell me what is more american than pumpkin at thanksgiving
8848050 at this time of year there are really only two major styles competing for seasonal popularity and between the oktoberfest beers and the pumpkin flavored brands i think pumpkin beer wins hands down for uniqueness and flavor
8848051 brewers can practice a ton of creativity when it comes to the pumpkin beer style some pumpkin ales purely rely on natural pumpkin flavors while others are highly spiced and take on the pure delight of liquid pumpkin pie
8848052 the amount of exuberance that pumpkin beer gets its just unbelievable
8848053 its not just a fad people honestly cant wait for pumpkin beer
8848054 hey this is so funny but someone told me youre actually 43 i totally dont care older men are totally sexy but how old are you really
8848055 when in deadly danger when beset by doubt run in little circles wave your arms and shout
8848056 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8848057 these are the industries which make up the engine of the regions economy
8848058 although businesses families and residents are going through some tough times the economy in the east of england is resilient and what we need is to balance immediate effective support with a focus on the long term goal
8848059 our role during this period is to make sure the regions businesses and the 5 5 million residents know what support is available to them
8848060 the east of england is being affected by global uncertainty but our regional economies are much stronger now after years of investment and growth
8848061 here in the east of england we are determined the government along with regional and local agencies such as eeda will all work together to ensure that businesses and households get the support they need
8848062 the regional economy is the uks fourth largest and has overtaken other areas to become the countrys top location for private sector research and development
8848063 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed

8848086 tu tu sei pazzo e io non ho nessuna intenzione di coprirti
8848087 growing up she was the peaceful one and i was the impossible one i was very rebellious about everything i also had a lot of energy thank god my parents took me to a ballet school every day because there was no way i could sit in my house

8848090 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8848091 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8848092 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8848093 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8848094 no one works for someone we all just work together
8848095 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8848096 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8848097 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8848098 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8848099 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8848100 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8848101 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8848102 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8848103 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8848104 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8848105 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8848106 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8848107 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8848108 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8848109 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8848110 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8848111 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8848112 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8848113 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8848114 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8848115 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8848116 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8848117 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8848118 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8848119 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8848120 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8848121 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8848122 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8848123 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8848124 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8848125 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8848126 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8848127 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8848128 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8848129 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8848130 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8848131 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8848132 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8848133 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8848134 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8848135 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8848136 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8848137 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8848138 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8848139 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8848140 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8848141 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8848142 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8848143 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8848144 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8848145 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8848146 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8848147 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8848148 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8848149 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8848150 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8848151 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8848152 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8848153 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8848154 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8848155 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8848156 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8848157 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8848158 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8848159 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8848160 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8848161 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8848162 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8848163 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8848164 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8848165 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8848166 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8848167 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8848168 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8848169 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8848170 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8848171 an error occurred while updating the default player for audio file types you do not have enough access privileges for this operation
8848172 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8848173 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8848174 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8848175 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8848176 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8848177 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8848178 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8848179 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8848180 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8848181 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8848182 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8848183 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8848184 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8848185 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8848186 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8848187 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8848188 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8848189 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8848190 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8848191 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8848192 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8848193 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8848194 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8848195 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8848196 all our services have been engaged to the maximum extent possible if we continue with the dynamics of the arrests from the past two years i expect the arrest will happen soon
8848197 its very unhelpful to make prognoses no one can say
8848198 he was a professional soldier and had an illusion that he was fighting for serb interests it would be best for him his family and us if he surrendered voluntarily
8848199 they all hope to gain from delays of the trials in light of the tribunals exit strategy
8848200 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it
8848201 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8848202 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be

8848244 as predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8848245 while there is still a distance to go the proposal to give india a clean exemption from global nuclear trade standards is in deep trouble
8848246 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8848247 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8848248 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground
8848249 there are signs however that the process of developing a revised draft is taking so long that the other 44 members will not have sufficient time to analyse the proposal and work through their respective national political processes to enable them to take a decision by next week
8848250 some indian officials and commentators have suggested that new delhi may walk away from the deal if the nsg establishes hyde act like requirements if that occurs so be it
8848251 the indian governments demands have been so unreasonable that the bush administration simply cant ram an india specific exemption through the nsg without accepting substantial changes and some common sense restrictions and conditions
8848252 in addition many nsg states have done their homework and are being reminded why the proposal to exempt india would be a nonproliferation disaster ngos and experts from nearly two dozen countries have been working for months to publish opeds encourage newspapers to write editorials critical of the deal send letters to their foreign ministers and meet with their parliamentarians to help encourage their governments to help reduce the damage to the nonproliferation system

8848282 we definitely have to play better well take the win but weve got to get better
8848283 it was great to see we knew we had a better football team than a year ago
8848284 to see it come out with a win tonight really makes us feel good its the kind of thing that will bring us even tighter together
8848285 we put this game on the offensive line we talked at halftime that this was the no 1 rush defense in the country last year and we wanted to out physical them we did that
8848286 he doesnt talk about his team and i dont talk about our team
8848287 it was just like last year in a lot of ways but a conference game and playing the way we did you have to give all the credit to the line and the fullbacks for getting on bodies the whole night
8848288 i get to run out on an nfl field in front of my family and everyone im just going to live it up and see what happens
8848289 i dont have the luxury of sitting back with my shoulder pads off
8848290 college was the last time i really got to play the whole game
8848291 ive been thinking to myself ive had a good camp yeah but its not over i want to prove to myself that i can be a viable receiver on this team
8848292 some guys will make it or break it in that game
8848293 but for the most part you know your team right now
8848294 i think some teams that are really deep right now there is value to this game for them because theyve got a number of guys theyre thinking can make the roster hopefully well be there some day
8848295 i think thats part of the reason why im not being successful
8848296 when i was in the minors i always started like 100 and everybody was really worried about me but ive always trusted in my tools and i know that i can do it
8848297 but you dont ever make promises in this business you just go down you do your best you get your swing back and you earn your way back up
8848298 something thats deep in the left field corner a cameraman from a certain angle might be more inclined to focus on the player well now he might be a little bit wider and keep an eye on the tip of the fence
8848299 because we know what were doing the camera guys know what theyre doing its up to major league baseball to take it from there
8848300 it would be hard to be a good coach if the guys didnt see that you loved them at some point
8848301 going against their first defense and being productive that was the highlight of my nfl career to date
8848302 a little bit but you always are in the preseason
8848303 every game is important if you take a day off the next day youll be gone
8848304 it doesnt make you uncomfortable it makes you want to work harder
8848305 hopefully ill get a phone call and go somewhere else this is a dream ive had since i was young im so close i dont want to give up yet
8848306 youve got a lot of adrenaline you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run so i just have fun with it and try to stay as relaxed as i can
8848307 its amazing that it was as long as it was
8848308 yeah its nice to win two in a row but the goals not to win two in a row the goals to win a lot more than that
8848309 ive spent bits of every season the last four years up and down
8848310 was a bit of a surprise but it wasnt something i was going to let bother me i was going to go down there and get my work in and get back up here as quick as i could
8848311 i dont want to put too much pressure on that if you start focusing on that number you might try too hard or overdo it itd be nice
8848312 to be told i might not be able to play again and to make it back to the big leagues

8848322 to still be in fresno at this juncture of the season is a bit shocking
8848323 i understand this is a transition year and maybe that transition does not involve me
8848324 its who we think going into next year is going to have a chance to help us
8848325 you want a smaller pool of guys because there is only going to be so much playing time within that pool you want an ample amount of time to evaluate them
8848326 just because somebody was in the big leagues or somebody has been here earlier in the year they wont have a free pass to get back up here
8848327 i feel that we all believe we can contribute at the major league level
8848328 weve proven it in previous seasons to sit and dwell on our misfortunes is not going to help us get back to that level
8848329 it cant be easy being in that situation passed up by some other guys and having to wait it out and see what happens in september
8848330 and im not going to sit and play gm im grateful to have had the opportunities that i have had and i believe that ive made the most of them all i can honestly say is that i would love to have the opportunity to play in the major leagues with any team that is willing to allow me that chance whether its the san francisco giants i cant say
8848331 hes been able to command his pitches in lower half of the strike zone better hes commanded his sinker and slider and used his curveball in the right counts it was just a matter of getting his strength and velocity up the key for him was getting back to healthy and trusting his stuff
8848332 im seeing better velocity on his fastball hes using it more i like the way hes pitching hes avoided throwing his breaking ball on all counts and hes using it as a put away pitch instead of trying to get ahead with it his velocity is back up to 93 or 94
8848333 its just consistency at the plate his knowledge of the strike zone has improved a lot hes putting better swings on the baseball just quality at bats thats what were looking for hes driven the ball a lot better this year than last year
8848334 fop just tore up his knee in albuquerque two weeks ago and hes out for the year he had surgery for an acl tear he was making progress he was getting his confidence back and we put him in the rotation for a couple of starts hopefully he continues after he comes back and we see what happens

8848349 we never underestimate anyone we know all our competitors need to be treated with respect and we need to fight hard with them
8848350 it felt great being out there because its been so long since ive had live action in a game over seven months
8848351 it felt good to work the kinks out it was important for our starting offensive line to go out there together and get some valuable time before next weeks opener
8848352 it was important to get playing time for demetrius todd jared gaither and more snaps for adam terry
8848353 that means a lot going into the opener they knocked some of the rust off

8848361 first of all i highly doubt that sanctions might ever happen but hypothetically speaking this would be to the detriment of the european union as much if not more than to russia
8848362 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8848363 i can only express the wish that european leaders will be able to rise above the emotions of the day and consider seriously and without prejudice the perspectives of strategic partnership with their important partner the russian federation
8848364 we need the new agreement as much as the eu does not less not more
8848365 we are strongly committed to keeping open channels to russia we have to look at who will be hurt by sanctions what will be the costs and benefits
8848366 sanctions would play into the hands of radical elements in moscow who want an escalation of the conflict
8848367 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8848368 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states about weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8848369 let me refer to the six point plan of presidents medvedev and sarkozy which does not include a reference of territorial integrity and its not a mistake it was deliberate i would say

8848376 im not complaining about this because of my record 4 14
8848377 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few

8848385 fans who had purchased tickets in rotterdam and oberhausen were very disappointed as the tour was called off at the last minute but we could do nothing about it we arrived at the decision to call off the tour after weighing the pros and cons of every possible solution the local promoters defaulted at the last minute making it impossible for us to continue with the shows
8848386 the official take is that local promoters defaulted and did not meet the requirements of wizcraft and stars on the tour however one of the main reasons for calling off the tour is mediocre ticket sales the tickets are very expensive and the meet and greet with the stars comes at an additional price also as compared to the unforgettable tour the tickets of srks temptations shows were much cheaper considering another temptations tour being in the offing in europe including germany bollywood fans were in no mood to buy expensive tickets for the unforgettable tour
8848387 the promoters of the show have defaulted on the contract im not authorised to give a comment on this and ticket price is not an issue all our other nine shows in canada trinidad and in entire usa and london were sold out
8848388 considering the fact that we are planning to have our segment of the show in europe we had an afterthought about doing the shows now in rotterdam and oberhausen we have now scheduled shows in the said european cities for our second segment in europe

8848405 in seeking to remove control for the future of the mayoralty of durham away from the people of durham city you will bring this embryonic unitary authority into disrepute
8848406 the city of durham is 900 years old and it carries with it many traditions that cannot simply be bandied around as the political playball of some modern institution
8848407 to draw trustees from the whole membership of the incoming unitary council thereby involving members with little or no connection with our city is clearly politically driven and divisive
8848408 such a machiavellian approach to the future of durham city will be seen by the people of durham for what it is and to repeat it will bring this infant authority into disrepute
8848409 i see no reason apart from sheer political power and vindictiveness to move in the way suggested
8848410 i dont think its right to say members outside durham city have no regard for durham city
8848411 i think we all have high regard for the history and traditions of durham city

8848435 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that daddy yankee and mccain
8848436 the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him
8848437 were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war

8848444 kids today face a lot of social challenges and dangers that their parents did not face growing up due to this age of technology
8848445 it used to be that a childs home was his or her refuge against bullies however nowadays with so many preteens and teens having their own cell phones and computers cyber bullies can impact a childs psyche in the home as well

8848532 but i got a lot of really touching e mails from people whose parents had killed themselves or who were suicidal i was going to kill myself but i have a daughter and reading your comic made me realize what it would do to her life so now im not going to what do you say except please see a therapist
8848533 questionable content has done a very good job of carving out its own niche in the comics world and im sure there are a fair number of slice of life comics that have come along in the past five years that would cite jacquess comic as an inspiration
8848534 seeing how well jeph and cristi are doing has really helped me not to accept things as they are and made me keep trying to move forward with audience and business
8848535 everything that happens in my life is in some way reflected in the comic
8848536 the older i get the more my perspective on the characters and their lives change and since im currently aging faster than the story is progressing im sure the characters will gradually change along with my outlook
8848537 uns fehlte bisher die durchschlagskraft ich muss schauen wie ich unsere offensivkr fte st rken kann oder ob ich etwas personell ndern muss wir brauchen mehr impulse nach vorne
8848538 ich bin in einer zwitterrolle nat rlich sind wir alle ber die punktausbeute entt uscht und es gibt viele dinge die verbessert werden m ssen ich muss mich aber auch mal sch tzend vor die mannschaft stellen
8848539 die frage ist ob ich das glas halbleer oder halbvoll sehe ich versuche es mit halbvoll als trainer muss ich den blick nach vorne richten
8848540 die gei b cke haben bislang erst einen z hler gesammelt wir wollen ihnen von beginn an zeigen dass es auch am freitag nichts mit dem ersten saisonsieg wird

8848544 neste momento tudo o que eu sei que tenho um grande prazer em tocar com esses dois caras e trabalhar em material novo quando eu entro no est dio eu nunca fa o perguntas se eu recebo uma liga o para ir e tocar eu aproveito o momento seja l o que isso der ter a chance de tocar com duas pessoas como essas algo fenomenal para mim minha vida o que eu sonhei fazer

8848546 how we think about licences is getting a bit more nuanced
8848547 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative licence they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licences that are readily combinable with epl code
8848548 we have decided that after nearly two years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers

8848553 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better

8848560 stripped naked beaten and mistreated and that they had been subjected to too rough handling
8848561 manhandled during detention and tactical questioning the lack of significant physical injuries led him to conclude that the force used against each detainee was
8848562 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008 he said
8848563 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8848564 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8848565 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8848566 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8848567 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8848568 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8848569 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8848570 i knew that there was a website or going to be a website about troy buswell

8848607 our policy is to stay out of pakistans internal affairs weve said that over and over again pakistan is a close ally it has a new government that government is trying to find its way its sorting through a whole host of very difficult issues

8848612 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8848613 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8848614 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8848615 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer

8848617 us still working on revised draft and india still demanding
8848618 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8848619 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8848620 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground
8848621 there are signs however that the process of developing a revised draft is taking so long that the other 44 members will not have sufficient time to analyse the proposal and work through their respective national political processes to enable them to take a decision by next week
8848622 some indian officials and commentators have suggested that new delhi may walk away from the deal if the nsg establishes hyde act like requirements if that occurs so be it
8848623 the indian governments demands have been so unreasonable that the bush administration simply cant ram an india specific exemption through the nsg without accepting substantial changes and some common sense restrictions and conditions
8848624 pakistan should take initiative in dismantling the terrorist training centers in pakistan if they want any help in doing so the indian government should cooperate

8848649 i question whether cindy is someone id want to see in the white house
8848650 the fact is my mother and cindy had lots of contact
8848651 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
8848652 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities following direct orders from their leaders

8848676 acum vreo 15 ani eram intr o situatie foarte grava cu sanatatea pentru care medicina alopata nu mi mai acorda sanse ca orice om am incercat si am reusit cu diverse proceduri alternative printre care si yoga asa ca am inceput sa practic yoga sub indrumarea fratelui meu care este antrenor instructor de yoga atestat de catre ministerul sanatatii si care are contracte in multe locuri cu multe institutii printre care si misa
8848677 despre yoga cred ca stiti foarte multe ca este o disciplina a mintii si a trupului si pe care am practicat o din pacate acum programul nu mi mai permite de o buna perioada de timp mai exact de c nd s a nascut fetita mea din 1998 era o practica alternativa pentru ca eu am practicat si karate si judo in facultate dar am facut yoga si in facultate daca vreti sa stiti sub indrumarea unui profesor de la medicina trei patru luni
8848678 pentru fratele meu nu faceam altceva dec t sa platesc taxa la casa de cultura a sindicatelor n r locul unde se desfasurau int lnirile misa si cursurile de yoga taxa de inchiriere a salii si sa fac cerere in numele lui pentru ca el locuind in bucuresti venea saptam nal duminica si s mbata aici adica imi lasa el cererea si eu o duceam la domnul director rata pentru inchirieri de sali asta era toata atributia mea

8848683 since i came to united theyve always been the team everyone wants to beat so were all used to that
8848684 and winning the double was a great achievement but were not satisfied with that
8848685 its something we all spoke about when we came back in pre season we want more trophies
8848686 we dont want to be known as a team which won the double and that was it we want to make history
8848687 hopefully in the next few years we will too i think we can do great things because weve got experienced players and young lads who can only get better
8848688 hopefully we will all keep learning keep playing well and keep winning trophies
8848689 in five or six years i hope people are saying what a great team we became
8848690 after that game the dressing room was a horrible place to be
8848691 no words were said and club wise its the worst ive ever been in
8848692 we realised that with the other teams who were left in the competition we would have had a great chance to win the fa cup it was really disappointing
8848693 the important thing was to keep that feeling at the back of your mind and make sure we went on to win the premier league and champions league
8848694 it was a very tight match between us the last time and we feel that we were unlucky to lose it
8848695 actually all of the games that we have played against eachother this season have been pretty tight so this should be another cracking match
8848696 cork are a very good team with some excellent players and we know that it will be tough to break them down but weve been playing well in the last few games so we will be confident of winning it
8848697 in a way we can use the cup game as motivation to get revenge over them they knocked us out of the competition which was a big blow as we felt that we could have at least reached the final of it this year
8848698 the cup is over for us but we want to finish as high as we can in the league so we will be looking to get the win and it would be nice to get one over them at the same time

8848841 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8848842 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to paid work when caring ends or changes to do so

8848852 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill

8848930 this is the last oceanfront property on the bay to be constructed and were only developing the minimum amount necessary to create an intimate resort experience residence club owners purchase a fraction of a home and they typically visit often while were keeping the overall density low owners will keep the tourism dollars flowing to help sustain huatulcos economy
8848931 residence clubs are a sensible way to own in any market but especially now members own deeded real estate in a prime location and prices reflect todays economy not only is the purchase price commensurate with the amount of use but the insurance taxes utilities maintenance replacement reserves and staff expenses are shared amongst owners the club is operated for the benefit and exclusive use of its owners similar to an equity golf country club
8848932 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8848933 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8848934 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8848935 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8848936 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8848937 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8848938 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8848939 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8848940 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8848941 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8848942 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8848943 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8848944 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8848945 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8848946 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8848947 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8848948 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8848949 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8848950 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8848951 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8848952 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8848953 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8848954 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8848955 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8848956 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8848960 the internet marketing zunch can provide is crucial to the success of our online expense report technology
8848961 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8848962 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8848963 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8848964 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8848965 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8848966 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8848967 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8848968 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8848969 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8848970 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8848971 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8848972 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8848973 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8848974 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8848975 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8848976 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8848977 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8849000 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8849001 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8849002 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8849003 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8849004 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8849005 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8849006 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8849007 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8849008 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8849009 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8849010 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8849014 who is making what might be perceived as big studio movies with big stars but each one of his films has a signature hes an artist
8849015 there were movies we would have considered but they werent ready
8849016 until about four or five years ago we didnt show any studio connected films at all and the fall releases are not quite like last year when you had so many high profile films that were of oscar quality
8849017 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8849018 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8849019 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8849020 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8849021 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8849022 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8849023 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others

8849025 didnt get the prize but shes gotten everything else shes the most respected most appreciated woman in the world shes gotten the utmost respect from world leaders really won out in that respect she will keep moving forward
8849026 in a good place but theyre having to work at it but theyll be fine they have so much important work to do the fact that she just ran makes her a winner she really did come out on top shes so much more defined as a politician today than she was when she got into the race

8849034 we front loaded most of our production for the first half of the year
8849035 2009 is set now were doing preproduction work in anticipation of 2010
8849036 we hope these initial hints of decline in production days for the feature category dont blossom into the trend witnessed in 2001 when labor contract uncertainties resulted in a strong first half of the year for on location feature production followed by a drastic decline in the latter half
8849037 the loss of this valuable and irreplaceable painting has saddened the entire community and we still hope it will be found
8849038 i would really think it would be important to try to get a painting as significant as this
8849039 its a bad place to give any art objects to and i want all of them back

8849049 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8849050 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8849051 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8849052 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8849053 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8849054 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8849055 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8849056 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8849057 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8849058 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8849059 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8849060 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8849061 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated

8849067 this landfall forecast may be adjusted several more times before this weekend

8849072 you might have heard some of my remixes but never known it was me
8849073 i thought if i want my remixes to be popular if i want people to even know im doing them maybe i should use youtube i never thought wed get as many views as we did i was tripping
8849074 i hadnt heard his remixes and didnt know how amazing a drummer travis is but we got together i threw on james browns funky drummer one of the most sampled beats in hip hop and i know you got soul by bobby byrd his face would just open up he would match the beat perfectly i thought damn this is fun its like a skeleton you get to put the clothes on and once the clothes are on you yank out the spine
8849075 people get fixated on him its like hes playing in blink but theres no breaks its a 45 minute song with super aggressive drums the whole time
8849076 ive been so busy with school and now im back in school thats a tremendous weight
8849077 but it seems like when im not doing anything im bored i had a friday off a couple of weeks ago i didnt know what to do i wasted a whole tank of gas just riding around im used to ripping and running
8849078 you can give them love thats not good you can take them all over thats not good you can give them food thats not good all they want is that money
8849079 my dad told me thats going to be the hit
8849080 i said dad i dont know i was looking at some other songs
8849081 but he said that beat is there and people are going to like that youre going to catch the youngsters with the beat and the older people with the french
8849082 so we went with it and thats the songs they playing the most
8849083 a lot of people ask me if im going to quit music
8849084 thats a tough question to answer i always say next subject
8849085 ill still have time to do my music on the weekends holidays and during the summer i think itll work together
8849086 i have said to the captain and the coach what my feelings are and i dont really want to say them in public
8849087 at the end of the day i was looking more long term in the winter and getting ready for the test series
8849088 i didnt envisage coming back to play in this series which makes it awkward but that is a bit down the line if i am picked for that game there is not much i can do about it
8849089 at the moment we have three games to win and if we do win that will be important for this england team as we head to antigua and into the winter
8849090 i am available from now to play every one day international and twenty20 for england
8849091 i did have eyes on playing one day cricket but i obviously wasnt quite there
8849092 both peter moores and kev told me to come back and play we need somebody we need a favour will you come and bowl i said i would come and play until the end of the series and see what happens then and ive enjoyed it
8849093 ive worked really hard to get over the injuries hurdle and have had two problem free years
8849094 im very close to my brother and got some good advice from the physios at middlesbrough about avoiding lung collapses i do a lot of core work and pilates
8849095 i struggled a bit i had a bit of a lull but after being left out i came back stronger
8849096 i hope to keep improving all the time and i want to play as much as possible ive got into the one day side recently and having a good run in the team definitely helps
8849097 it bugs me that i tend to get pigeon holed as someone who only gets wickets when pitches are helpful
8849098 i totally disagree with that my best figures before this have been at trent bridge and old trafford and i want to keep on proving i can meet the challenge of bowling on flat pitches
8849099 i havent heard of any interest from the selectors but i hope to knock loudly enough on the door for them to take notice
8849100 the wicket was really good today it was a lot quicker than yesterday so we could play our shots
8849101 wed like another 50 or 60 runs hopefully well get them in the morning
8849102 im delighted but itd be great to get 1 500
8849103 weve got a couple of games left but if i keep doing the basics right then hopefully i can get close
8849104 i really think theres a lot of legs left in this stuff and a lot of stories i still want to tell
8849105 every time you go out and do a story you find five or six more the list gets longer not shorter
8849106 the concept was that we live in this great spot but were all in such a hurry that we drive by things without looking and dont even notice whats around us
8849107 its a great show and were proud to have it continuing on kron
8849108 the stars of the show have always been the people who were featured
8849109 our job is to go out and find interesting passionate funny caring knowledgeable people and then get out of the way of their stories
8849110 one of the keys to success was that it was celebrating where we lived we pay a lot of money for our houses its not always easy to live here
8849111 but we also have amenities that no urban area in the world has the entire world is here so we have all these cultures all these cuisines all these ideas and then we have a protected landscape that no other urban area has
8849112 our idea is to say well give you all of our best stuff
8849113 i have to be very sincere the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts in erin brockovich when she got the academy award
8849114 i was very excited i was not in los angeles but i saw on television and i really was excited to see her when she appeared with my dress
8849115 when i work and i create i am not very approachable to know everything i say was being recorded did irritate me
8849116 the film was showing exactly what i am there were moments of anger when somebody says something that i dont like but i was completely myself from the beginning to the end and nothing was edited
8849117 i dont think haute couture will ever really die its like a beautiful song it will be there forever and it will never go out of fashion

8849128 twelve years ago i would have been hard pressed to understand why id want to be involved sexually with one person this long
8849129 before t a the longest my intense sexual interest would last would be maybe two years but the thing men dont realize is that initial rush you get from sex gives way to something else a lot of guys run with fear when that intensity starts to fade but the real rewards of a relationship come after youve been together a while thats where t a and i are lucky it keeps getting deeper its kind of exciting im as surprised as anybody
8849130 im not running for president so i dont have to answer that question but theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience

8849205 they still have a good ballclub they are playing well right now so are we every time you go to boston its exciting you feel the electricity of the ballpark and the fans and the team i always like to go there because thats what baseball is all about
8849206 its not too bad compared to that 16 day stretch

8849219 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up

8849221 wow in my arms and 2 hearts are crackers they go off like a frog in a sock
8849222 im releasing my inner freddie mercury its hard to explain but parts of the show are so over the top

8849226 were never going to disrespect another hurricane again in our life
8849227 people who were around during katrina will see the difference in whats happening
8849228 things that happened after the storm made landfall are happening before the storm makes landfall
8849229 hundreds of thousands of mres meals ready to eat and liters of water right here in this state
8849230 we feel we are more ready this year than we have ever been
8849231 in general were finding that state local and federal agencies are tremendously more capable than they were three years ago after katrina
8849232 five years ago we wouldnt even know there was a hurricane out there
8849233 we got a win and thats the no 1 objective whenever you play a game
8849234 but we have to do some things better on the field than we did
8849235 the holes were huge you could drive a truck through them the wide receivers were blocking downfield the fullbacks did a good job blocking too it made my job a lot easier
8849236 i think we could have had more than seven to be honest with you
8849237 i know i had him a couple of times and he got away
8849238 had to deal with issues of security and scalability from the start
8849239 microsoft realized that mac address filtering and early vpn solutions would not be a scalable final solution to support a global wlan
8849240 and you actually need to be connected to the wired infrastructure to get the certificate the first time
8849241 we think weve solved this with our 802 1x infrastructure
8849242 having a separate guest network is actually more secure than having your guest connect to your corporate network and be able to have access to anything there
8849243 this really does give us the ability to provide internet access to any of our guests without opening up any access to our corporate network
8849244 so that if anybody calls me itll be able to can find me in any one of our buildings or outside the buildings
8849245 its the same standards the same connectivity which makes it seamless for somebody traveling to redmond or to our offices in tokyo london or new york
8849246 they walk into the building and it automatically connects like the way it does here
8849247 today our end users dont even realise thats happening in the background when we provision new machines that are connected to the network
8849248 we havent found anyone that has a bigger private wireless network
8849249 supplement to the ubiquitous wired connectivity it was not designed to be an primary network connectivity device
8849250 became a highly desired connectivity choice enabling impromptu discussions software demonstrations and ability to take your work with you to meetings all of which had a positive impact on worker productivity
8849251 in just time they would spend connecting and reconnecting to the network
8849252 if they have a meeting or theyre grabbing people from the hall to go in to a room to collaborate
8849253 they can stay connected to the network as they undock from their docking station and then just seamlessly connect to the wireless network
8849254 absolutely if its not working somewhere we get complaints immediately
8849255 people dont carry around the wired cords and we dont have cables in the conference rooms anymore

8849289 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8849305 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8849306 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8849307 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago

8849467 you know what would clear that knee up turmeric you know the spice
8849468 first we thought someone is bursting crackers and so we ran towards the main gate then we saw and heard people screaming and running there was blood all over the place swamiji and mataji and others were lying in blood i shouted and ran away we all started running here and there
8849469 swamiji ran into the toilet to save himself and shut the door mataji who hid behind the door was shot first the miscreants then broke open the toilet door and sprayed bullets
8849470 i rushed towards the main gate along with others only to see some men running around and loud cracking noise i heard the cries of swamiji and others i saw other swamijis running here and there i was scared and ran inside the hostel room with another girl we sat huddled together until after a long time one of the swamijis came and escorted us out of the room
8849471 i too rushed out after hearing the noise i saw bodies lying in blood i touched swamijis feet who was lying in the bathroom it was still warm but he did not move nor did mataji who lay inside the room
8849472 we had written 30 times to the state government that swamijis and our lives were at stake that we were being threatened by christian leaders before the incident we got a letter threatening to kill swamiji we formally complained to the police and district authorities they sent only four baton wielding constables
8849473 not a single minister visited us after the incident not even of our bjp the collector comes sometimes he gave us rice dal and sugar for the children
8849474 the maoists can never do this it is christians who threaten us everyday and they did this
8849475 no one called us for any meeting or to take part in any peace process as long as are kept out the violence will continue
8849476 isnt it far fetched district authorities blaming a particular outfit within minutes of arriving at a crime scene
8849477 the five attackers who the locals caught and handed over to the police are not maoists they are from the region
8849478 moreover i see no reason why the maoists will spare the policemen on duty
8849479 they see themselves as revolutionaries they never care about whether they are seen or not in fact i would say they would very much want to be seen

8849594 and after that the pains start and within one hour the baby deliver
8849595 why did it take this long to hear someone in a national setting ask the same question
8849596 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8849597 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8849598 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production

8849604 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8849605 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8849606 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8849607 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8849608 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8849609 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8849610 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8849611 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8849612 im always going to remember being a little part of this

8849654 the closed rhinoplasty is nearly a lost art it is significantly more difficult for the surgeon to learn and demands a steeper longer learning curve than the open approach
8849655 i can perform rhinoplasty either through a closed or open approach however i reserve the open rhinoplasty approach for only very special circumstances in most primary rhinoplasty or majority of beverly hills revision rhinoplasty patients i believe that the experienced surgeon should have the capability to perform rhinoplasty through the closed approach which is how i perform the majority of my cases i have seen too many scars underneath the nose that do not heal properly as a result of the open rhinoplasty technique if these scars do not heal well it is extremely difficult to correct them and they can potentially remain permanently visible
8849656 in practicality it can also be problematic since the open technique can in some cases cause significantly more scarring skin shrinkage and long term unpredictability than the closed techniques

8849793 we received information that banana sellers were mixing carbide powder with ice and applying it externally on the fruits we have taken samples to analyse the contents we will ensure that the offenders are punished
8849794 we have no choice but to use chemicals usually bananas take 15 days to ripen so we place the bananas on ice mixed with carbide powder to ripen them within four days this also gives the fruits an appealing yellow colour

8849822 meeting him was like waking up from a dream and finding out its real
8849823 try to hold your breath as much as possible and dont give up
8849824 there is every reason to believe that the accused was intoxicated on the night in question
8849825 however the events described by the victim compel me to the conclusion that the accused knew what he was about and intended to end her life
8849826 i am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the necessary murderous intent
8849827 its an attempted murder where the accused returned twice to repeatedly attack the complainant with a knife
8849828 the wounds he inflicted on her were grievous the brutality is extreme
8849829 this is progress towards justice of this criminal and we look forward to the sentencing
8849830 harvest is upon us again and the rcmp would like to remind all persons in the industry that safety of all must be a priority children should not be allowed access to or near farm equipment
8849831 in the colony way of life the younger we can teach them the better
8849832 they were just absolutely super kids they were smart beyond measure
8849833 not only were they my grandchildren they were dear to my heart too
8849834 certainly if both boys attended the school they would have been close with all the others
8849835 this was way too complicated way way too clean to be anything but professional
8849836 no ones going to be able to open a shop with my stuff everything we had was top of the line and i know my stuff
8849837 they broke the hidden cameras they knew where the wires were for the hidden cameras and i didnt even know that
8849838 i would rather know who this is id do anything to know who did it you feel like youre raped youre sick i just want whoever did it to be punished and feel like we did
8849839 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8849840 i have said to the captain and the coach what my feelings are and i dont really want to say them in public
8849841 at the end of the day i was looking more long term in the winter and getting ready for the test series
8849842 i didnt envisage coming back to play in this series which makes it awkward but that is a bit down the line if i am picked for that game there is not much i can do about it
8849843 at the moment we have three games to win and if we do win that will be important for this england team as we head to antigua and into the winter
8849844 i am available from now to play every one day international and twenty20 for england
8849845 i did have eyes on playing one day cricket but i obviously wasnt quite there
8849846 then i got a phone call when i was putting the kids to bed at two oclock on the thursday i could still hear the lads in the nets
8849847 both peter moores and kev told me to come back and play we need somebody we need a favour will you come and bowl
8849848 i said i would come and play until the end of the series and see what happens then and ive enjoyed it
8849849 the family reasons were not the only reason i packed in
8849850 it was one of the main reasons but it wasnt the whole thing
8849851 i packed it in for cricketing reasons i wasnt bowling very well and was not enjoying my cricket
8849852 the family thing didnt help but the family is a lot more stable now i have four kids and i dont envisage having any more
8849853 at the end of the day it is two months away but i would be two months away anyway because i would have to go to south africa and then on to play the test matches
8849854 i might as well do the bowling in the one day series and be a part of what ive missed
8849855 going away to south africa to play four day matches to get ready for the test match or playing one day cricket for england was really a no brainer
8849856 this period out of the spotlight has probably been the best thing for me because i have bowled a lot of overs this year

8849858 vooral jonge vrouwen hebben het echt als eis dat de man absoluut geen haar mag hebben en dan heb ik het niet over hoofdhaar ze vinden het veel properder als hij zijn genitali n scheert terwijl je toch eerder zou denken dat dat haar daar staat net om de boel properder te houden

8849866 i thought the master has arrived crazy bill the red faced rageaholic was somewhere else this was deft political pro bill doing what no one had been able to do up to this point at the convention and that is make the case for barack obama

8849888 i have learned in this that the edmonton community heals the wounded with love
8849889 the wagons were circled and everyone who became involved or affected by this story opened up their arms with expertise strength love and sometimes cookies

8849926 i couldnt believe what i was hearing that there would be a rebuilding of the toxteth street area with new properties built
8849927 i couldnt believe that a developer could remove me from where i was living against my wishes and build a new property
8849928 judged on community benefits environmental impact and cost rehabilitation and refurbishment is clearly the way forward
8849929 there is something about terraced houses that make them a successful model for housing they can accommodate different types of people and different types of lifestyles and these particular terraces in east manchester are full of character
8849930 there is nothing wrong with terraced properties except the sheer quantity of them and they are very very low value in the current market place these properties are not even getting their reserve prices at auction
8849931 they are the lowest value housing stock in the market place and we are replacing them with 430 family homes with gardens and driveways which is giving a different sort of offer
8849932 they are incredibly tight but you can make them work i think it just takes a little but of imagination to think about how we work with these houses to breathe some new life into them
8849933 the area that i came to initially has now largely disappeared
8849934 i think that given the opportunity the people who have been shifted out of the toxteth street area would come back and thats what i hope
8849935 there is no possible way that i would live ever in a community that they are trying to construct out of a computer
8849936 we started off really wanting to make a point that demolition is insane because on every level it doesnt make sense
8849937 but weve got a situation now where we feel that this is a viable alternative and in fact a preferable alternative
8849938 the beauty of these kind of designs is that there are many of these terraces not just in manchester but all over the country and with slight modifications these kind of refurbishment proposals can be applied to different areas
8849939 ive just got to decide when and if at the moment there is nothing concrete anywhere
8849940 there has been some inquiry i have had a couple of discussions a couple with my boss at cricket south africa everybody knows exactly where they stand ive been open and honest with everyone ive spoken to
8849941 at the end of this tour ill just need some time off and reflect on where i want to go in my career after april next year
8849942 if anything happens it is not going to happen until after australia thats where my contract goes to and where my focus is
8849943 australia was always the culmination of mine and graemes planning that was our target my thought process is entirely on that
8849944 i see our one day side now where we were with our test team two years ago
8849945 its going to be a work in progress and it has to be driven to the next world cup
8849946 i dont think we are the one day side we were and we are going to have to live with that
8849947 were probably not number two in the world at the moment as the rankings suggest
8849948 weve lost depth weve lost the ability to hit the ball out of the ground at the back end of our innings weve lost a key bowler up front with the new ball weve lost a key bowler at the death
8849949 we need guys to come in and weve got to find the right balance and the right personnel
8849950 we need to see them blossom and well see the benefit of that in two years time
8849951 its an exciting challenge to get the team up and going forward but were certainly not the finished article at the moment it is going to take time

8849955 no podemos ir para adelante sin pensar hay que tener serenidad y saber cuando jugar la pelota para los costados
8849956 in the face of good growth and loose fiscal policy i dont expect any relaxation in the central banks tight policy stance even though inflation has moderated slightly
8849957 consumption spending is going to get a boost from an expansionary fiscal policy in the second half of the year we expect growth for the whole fiscal year to come down to about 7 5 per cent
8849958 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who
8849959 its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

8849967 this just isnt good enough the housing market is in a very serious position and we need serious action the figures show that it is agents and consumers that are bearing the brunt of this indecision and whilst we need a planned and managed response from the government we also need it quickly
8849968 in just 12 months this economic landslide has sent the consumer lending market into disarray

8849972 you are not going to behave like the leaders of a faction
8849973 im always keen to have a horse in australian during the spring so rather than whacking around back home in the mud we decided to bring both of them over
8849974 and everything has started off well i was very happy with giginos run
8849975 when you consider he was only beaten four lengths by those good horses and he had only arrived in australia a couple of days prior it was a good first up performance
8849976 both these horses i think are carnival horses and they are probably going to race in australia again other than just this trip
8849977 we had a lot of interest from people wanting to buy him after that win but i own fifty per cent of him and a good friend of mine owns a share and he has always wanted to win a derby
8849978 so rather than wait for the new zealand derby in march next year we thought we would come to sydney and melbourne and set a campaign for the vrc derby
8849979 ive done some research and looking back on the derby most horses have won it on their fifth or sixth start so sufficient will run in the derby on his fifth or sixth start because hes a natural stayer
8849980 im not under any illusions the golden rose is not going to be an easy race to win first up with a potential derby winner
8849981 by running on saturday it gives me three weeks to the gloaming which suits perfectly because his main goal here in sydney is the group one spring champion stakes
8849982 saturday will obviously tell us a lot especially where we are fitness wise
8849983 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8849984 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
8849985 you also know however that our business model is not perfect and that we make a loss on every console we sell
8849986 nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us
8849987 we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
