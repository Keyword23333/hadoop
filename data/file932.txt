9320008 exempting the ski industry from sales tax was put forward in the 60s when the ski industry was very small and the state legislature wanted to encourage and promote it
9320009 i would argue that the ski industry is very much on its feet and has probably grown a few extra feet
9320010 i get to stand on the sidelines of history and witness it
9320011 mccain needs the conservative vote he has a woman and this is just wow
9320012 you just cant afford not to be as prepared as possible after what we saw happened after katrina how can we not prepare as much as we possibly can

9320014 i was just expressing myself ten years of my life went down the drain
9320015 he made an error in asking joe to cut his braid
9320016 we are very sorry i apologized on the behalf of the northridge staff
9320017 because of the convention and the beijing olympics people are not eating out but staying home watching television
9320018 we knew many businesses were giving people time off or letting employees work from home but it turned out that the convention attendees more than made up for that
9320019 were on a long term marketing and public relations strategy and this was a piece of that
9320020 at this time of year we start to get more children because the crops are ready to harvest
9320021 this is a preschool program its not just a day care if theyve never held a pair of scissors before we teach them how to cut we teach them how to draw how to write their name and how to interact with other children

9320025 i wanted to do something with the miniature soldiers id collected

9320028 sometimes dale would be awake when i arrived but yesterday the chuch was still locked i noticed the desk drawers were pulled open and the office in disarray i just saw a bloody hand and found him in a kneeling position he was already cold
9320029 he isnt going to be swayed by what he likes on a visit he is going to make the broken leg decision where would he want to go to school if he wasnt playing basketball
9320030 i am thrilled with the schools he is considering they all offer great academics and great athletics
9320031 im not sure the coaches are used to moms asking that
9320032 he is hearing the most from duke rutgers and appalachian state right now
9320033 duke seems to be the most interested and wednesday hakeem had duke stuff on his car it is up to the colleges now
9320034 louisburg may have the best pair of running backs in the area
9320035 strickland could start for just about any team in the area
9320036 he went to the florida state camp and was named the mvp of the whole camp
9320037 i think he can help some college team and i think the college coaches know that hes going to get some offers
9320038 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up

9320044 someone in the house was able to press a panic button
9320045 police were in the vicinity and were able to respond quickly they came with their lights flashing and in totally marked cars
9320046 somebody said stop police then shooting tat tat tat tat
9320047 inside the car a male voice said are you police or metro a lady was screaming inside the car then someone must have fallen on the steering wheel because the hooter went on for 15 minutes
9320048 the paramedic told me that both had been hit more than once
9320049 trade openness is believed to have been central to the remarkable growth of developed countries since the mid 20th century and an important factor behind the poverty alleviation experienced in most of the developing world since the early 1990s
9320050 seven years ago we introduced at doha what was to be a
9320051 president kennedy who introduced the tokyo round famously said this will lift all boats and help developing countries like japan case made i would have thought
9320052 africa critically needs to realise development and get itself out of poverty through the establishment of fair trade rather than aid
9320053 the aggressive push by the rich countries led by the us and the eu for more trade liberalisation at a time of global crises of food and fuel became too blatant for developing countries to stomach

9320056 but i definitely dont like mccain because of the eight years with bush well see
9320057 i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9320058 everyone here is pro coal thats what the economy is built on
9320059 everything i hear he seems to be more anti coal
9320060 all hes going to do is raise your taxes spend spend spend
9320061 anything hes going to do is going to enlarge government and raise taxes to support larger government
9320062 theres probably not been enough money printed to support his plans
9320063 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9320064 and it is warm not something im really used to
9320065 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9320066 after 19 months of traversing through every state except alaska
9320067 which now that i think about it were going to have to go there now
9320068 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9320069 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9320070 does anyone else think its creepy that you dont have to refrigerate those tiny half amp half thimbles full o cream i always assumed that the one half is milk the other half is cream but theres a sucker born every minute cause milk and cream need to be refrigerated those tiny half amp half thimbles are free of that burden they just sit there in a big basket in the hotel lobby no expiration date no ingredients no excuses like little aliens in the food pyramid they must fall somewhere between twinkies and pop tarts and i for one love twinkies and pop tarts but that doesnt help me shake the fear
9320071 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9320072 and it is warm not something im really used to
9320073 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9320074 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9320075 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9320076 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9320077 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9320078 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9320079 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9320080 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9320081 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9320082 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9320083 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9320084 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9320085 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9320086 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9320087 discussions strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates he asked a lot of questions and listened didnt tip his hand to too many of us he was very insistent that this process often wounds people and we were to stay very quiet
9320088 we obviously were looking at a lot of different options
9320089 we looked at base options women pro choice pro life people outside the party it was a very broad and deep search most of the people we checked out never made it into the public domain and some speculated on were very very competitive for the job
9320090 its a little naive on the part of the media to assume because they werent reporting this palins consideration for the last few months theres something up on this we didnt spend any time saying yes or no to any of the speculation just because everyone thought it was going to be mitt romney for a month and then it was going to be joe lieberman for a month
9320091 shes got an ability that far exceeds her tenure in office
9320092 continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9320093 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9320094 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9320095 everybody is still so gun shy from hurricanes katrina and rita we just want to make sure our state is safe

9320101 st paul is mentioned many times in the bible but minneapolis never
9320102 and the city has bent way over backwards for us
9320103 right now st paul cops are trying to get the secret service to do something for us that for two months weve been told cant be done
9320104 weve been to washington d c and other places and this is one of the cleanest prettiest cities with the nicest people weve ever seen we saw more water coming in on the airplane than we have in the whole state of arizona
9320105 the situation has not changed i want to leave real and play for chelsea i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there
9320106 since may i have been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to know because they were so sure of signing cristiano ronaldo now they havent signed anyone they dont want me to go
9320107 real president ramon calderon had said that if a good offer came they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort and i dont know what more i can do
9320108 i have told the president the sports director and the coach i want to go i wont refuse to play for real if i stay but if schuster wants to keep a player who is unhappy it is his responsibility
9320109 i am feeling fine i am feeling really good and my recovery is going well
9320110 i am more than happy with my progress and i hope to be back playing for united by the end of september that is my target and it is a realistic one
9320111 it has been frustrating to miss the start of the
9320112 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9320113 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9320114 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9320115 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9320116 manchester city fc can confirm that argentinian defender pablo zabaleta has signed for the club today from espanyol for an undisclosed fee
9320117 we feel the addition of pablo is another great signing for manchester city
9320118 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9320119 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9320120 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9320121 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9320122 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9320123 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything

9320142 in just five years fashion rocks has become one of the most exciting multi media events of the year
9320143 this photo perfectly captures what fashion rocks is all about the past and the present music and fashion light and dark whirling around in a pool of inspiration influence and energy comfortingly familiar and jarringly modern all at once
9320144 we know that one third of the cancer burden could be cured if there were early detection and proper access to medical help
9320145 i think hes got an issue that is going to last the rest of the year
9320146 all ive got to do is get a hint that playing him is not in his best interest and ill shut him down
9320147 he hasnt gotten better im just seeing him in batting practice and i see him taking ankiel like swings but hasnt been swinging like that in a game
9320148 this is what ive got to do now the goal is to piece together a good september
9320149 i dont care who the cardinals run out there they could grab somebody out of the stands and theyd throw a good game against us
9320150 we cant watch what milwaukee does weve just got to win i basically stunk guys put five runs on the board and that should be enough i just didnt get my job done
9320151 it means sunday is a really important game thats what it tells me
9320152 we need to salvage one game in this series and sunday is our last chance you dont want to come in here and get swept
9320153 thats not his game thats not anybodys game he got up and he got nailed
9320154 i know it was a short hop i knew it was a trap
9320155 i acted like i caught it and thats what you do in that situation
9320156 we looked at this road trip like we had to win the series and its not looking good its must win sunday whatever anybody says i really do believe its a must win
9320157 hes been in so many situations and done a lot of things well not perfect yet but almost from day 1
9320158 hes established that he could pitch as a winning reliever on a contending team there isnt any reason to think he couldnt be a starting pitcher as well
9320159 hes had a very good year when you take everything into consideration the fact that hes young that its his first year here that hes established himself as a major league pitcher hes earned his way to be in a position where hes used in significant situations in the game
9320160 he should be ready to come into spring training and compete for a starting job on our team
9320161 i was just taking it a day at a time there but realistically if you would have asked me on day 1 if i would stay up here all season i wouldnt have guessed it would happen its a big deal
9320162 he could have done whatever he wanted by pointing to their dugout and getting fired up
9320163 but he pointed the wrong way to our dugout i didnt like that i had to stand up for my teammates

9320190 gustav is a category three hurricane on the saffir simpson scale
9320191 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane until landfall
9320192 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9320193 i try not to look at the numbers but i see the interceptions before i see the touchdowns he said
9320194 im trying to limit them i hope i have zero next week
9320195 it is hard to swallow when you come out and prepare so hard to lose by such a short margin to a good team he said
9320196 but its something to build on it gives us an accurate look at where we are as a team
9320197 we were able to open things by taking some shots down the field locksley said
9320198 weve got to find a way to finish the game there were still a lot of plays that were left out on the field
9320199 we said all along juice was making a lot of progress and i think everyone can see that zook said
9320200 he is becoming the guy you should become in your third year starting im proud of the way he hung in there he was dead tired he didnt run quite as much but when he did he made things happen which was good hell just continue to improve
9320201 i try not to force things thats what i did my freshman and sophomore years
9320202 the x ray is negative and that was good news to me and to mizzou fans
9320203 i cant speculate whether hell be out two days or two weeks but the good news is hes ok
9320204 my players were a little disappointed and that upsets me a little bit pinkel said
9320205 when you win you enjoy winning there will be many lessons to learn but you enjoy winning are you kidding me
9320206 he also caught some passes which is something we want to get going with the tailbacks he definitely opened up some of the passing game i dont think one time the first guy tackling him brought him down
9320207 we got kind of cold there in the third quarter its a team deal but we certainly have some guys who can make plays
9320208 i got them all smiling and laughing and made them feel good he said
9320209 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
9320210 several italian newspapers cited vatican sources suggesting that mr bush may be prepared to convert
9320211 anything is possible especially for a born again christian such as bush
9320212 is not unaware of how evangelism by comparison with catholicism may seem more limited both theologically and historically
9320213 in the view of the theologian the madonna who gives birth to the man child signifies the priority of the mother aspect of divinity the oval nimbus in which the figure stands represents the glorification of the creative power as exemplified in motherhood the christ child always symbolizes wisdom the virgin mother faith the figure therefore declares that wisdom born of faith shall redeem the world now encircled by the serpent of evil

9320217 the eye in the pyramid is not now nor has it ever been a masonic symbol
9320218 the great seal of the united states is not a masonic emblem nor does it contain hidden masonic symbols
9320219 the temple of man is a monumental product of intellect scholarship and exploration into the pharaonic mentality of ancient egypt there is no work more ambitious in seeking to render accessible the consciousness of a time and place remote from and extremely alien to our own the sufficiently careful and aware reader can actually take on enough of the mindset being described as to arrive at states of consciousness unlike any experienced by contemporary people it then becomes possible to glimpse that extraordinary mentality which cast in egypt a spell of luminous fascination still potent after thousands of years
9320220 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9320221 its important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9320222 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9320223 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9320224 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9320225 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9320226 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9320227 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9320228 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9320229 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with re uk chancellor alistair darling says economic crisis the worst in 60 years
9320230 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9320231 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9320232 he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites
9320233 so if the races of man are to survive it is ok for us to exterminate the lower races in order for the higher races to survive
9320234 im eliminating the competition in order for my offspring to survive might makes right but we are taught that this is wrong morals have always been taught to kids so we can eliminate this behavior out of them
9320235 grand master freemason albert pike was instrumental in the klan many could have gotten sucked into those troubled times what does this have to do with being anti communist my education post shows marxist influence on education are you defending marxism now

9320237 apathy are you saying the new world order doesnt exist
9320238 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9320239 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism
9320240 what brings you to this forum you came directly to this thread and dogmaticly disregard any and all evidence for a global flood there is a mountain of evidence for the flood that even the blind can see the universal chalk layer polystrate fossils pillow lava on mtn tops non confomities within the geo column rappid petrification the numerous fraudulent dating methods used yet carbon dating shows coal is young which is disregarded billions of years do not exist neither millions
9320241 the only ones dogmatically clinging to this fairy tale of pagan evolution are either those in the education field for obvious reasons or pagans themselves freemasons knights kabalist all other witches or roman catholics who will not accept the bible including genesis which does not support their pope they often call themselves atheist and call catholics christian as if they are an expert on christianity for them accepting genesis would mean becoming a protestant excommunication and being disowned by their family a high price to pay for standing up for the truth the truth is a divider
9320242 none of your dating works you cant prove that the earth is millions of years old you guys cant even get 2 test to give the same result bet still stands perform your own tests
9320243 you dont have any if you did they would be paraded around not locked up in the basement of the smithsonian like the coelacanth lol
9320244 sorry not true their are always resistant strains they survive and breed they were already immune same as a killer flu virus it will kill off a lot of people but not all the people why some are just immune from it and will most likely pass that on to their offspring but its not guaranteed now if a virus turned into a moue that would be different now wouldnt it

9320246 thats nice johhny use a creationist that set up the chart by similarities wasnt darwin a creationist i believe so if by your reckoning of dna then were most closely related to the eggplant a chimp is higher on the evolutionary scale than we are and a fern is the highest evolved form of life on the planet nice one bj
9320247 wow do i really need to address this again one no where on earth can you find the geological column in its exact geological order and second you date the order by the fossils found in the layer at the same time you date those fossils by which layer they were found in third most of the time the younger layers are on the bottom and the older layers are on top like on the continental shelfs
9320248 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9320249 the more civilized so called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence looking to the world at no very distant date what an endless number of lower races has been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world
9320250 i think we must admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation i know that this is anathema to physicists as it is to me but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it
9320251 now this professor is an advocate of the theory of evolution
9320252 i believe that you can feel the religious overtones in that statement concerning the theory of evolution you can also see that someone who has preached it with the great zeal of thisman has had his entire comprehension of the universe altered it is more than a science to this man it is his religion it has permeated his entirepersonality under the guise of intelligence
9320253 has now come to realize that the possibility of a cell coming into existence by chance is impossible
9320254 if it comes to a choice between believing in a creator and believing in a scientific impossibility i will believe the impossibility
9320255 stupid statement he is saying that over the eons as the eyes have evolved from one creature to the next theeyes have remained the same but the genetic information producing the eyes have changed he is saying that mutations produced thesame results but with different combinations of genes thats utterly ridiculous but it is typical of the desperate measures taken by the evolutionist tobe able to hold on to his god the theory of evolution
9320256 if the theory of evolution is true we should see organs in the human body for instance that were useful to the human during his evolution but that since have become useless
9320257 there are about 180 organs in the human body listed by evolutionists as being in this category they included things such as the appendix the thymus gland and the big toe
9320258 guess what else is part of the auto immune system
9320259 the truth is there are no organs that do not have a purpose if evolution really happened we should see them
9320260 we should also see organs being born that is organs that seeing strange organs developing in our bodies organs that have no use at the present but that will have a use sometime in the future but we do not because there are none this is still another instance of the proclamation of assumed processes processes that have no proof of ever having happened
9320261 imagine the first amphibian as he started to evolve a wing at first it would be just a stub having evolved from a useful forearm in the midst of its evolution it would become a useless stub being halfway between a forearm and a wing it would have no function while evolving thus it places a severe handicap on the creature obviously natural selection would not allow such a thing to take place genetics certainly disallows it so there is no way with reasonable thought thatit could have happened
9320262 lucy has massive v shaped jaws in contrast to man
9320263 to complicate matters further some researchers believe that the afarensis sample lucy is really a mixture of two separate species the most convincing evidence for this is based on characteristics of the knee and elbow joints
9320264 johanson himself originally described the fossils as homo a species of man but soon after changed his mind based on the assessment of his colleague tim white they now describe the bones as too ape like in the jaws teeth and skull to be considered homo yet also sufficiently distinct from other later australopithecines to warrant their own species
9320265 the term falls outside the usual naming conventions for early humans and is used in a general sense to describe the oldest modern people in europe the skeletons showed the same high forehead upright posture and slender gracile skeleton as modern humans

9320276 you need to be scared you need to be concerned you need to get your butts out of new orleans this is the storm of the century
9320277 riding it out would be the biggest mistake you could make in your life

9320279 between the buses train and aircraft there is no reason for anyone to ride out the storm in new orleans this is simply too dangerous of a storm
9320280 last year we needed 3 5 mils of tax to generate 1 5 million in revenue
9320281 now that assessments have come in higher it made sense to roll back the rate the reason we are able to do this is because fire expenses are coming in below budget the city council understands that these are tough economic times so we are pleased that we can lower tax for the community
9320282 staying in the black is always the number one yearly budget goal
9320283 it has been a difficult year due to fuel prices and unforeseen building and vehicle maintenance charges but everyone has felt the crunch and the pain not just me
9320284 sometimes you have to do without to make things work
9320285 it comes down to every member of the department being accountable for and caring about the citizens tax dollars i make all monetary decisions as if it was my personal money we all look toward the future for purchases look for price increases and buy what we need before the taxpayers have to suffer needlessly
9320286 anytime citizens can receive help or assistance and services are not jeopardized im all for it
9320287 the citizens deserve the very best and the city leaders expect them to receive the very best
9320288 to help offset the expenses for providing our city fire protection suppression and rescue
9320289 the fire tax will generate approximately 1 5 million as you can see that doesnt quite cover half the fire budget
9320290 the city decided that is all its going to levy on citizens as far as property tax on that service
9320291 the average taxpayer is going to see some reduction we have worked real hard to contain costs and keep from having to raise taxes thanks to the outstanding people working for the city who do everything they can to control expenses we are able to do that
9320292 i have such a good time strolling through this store

9320302 now you could have littleton police looking for a guy but they cant find him because hes in jail in rockingham county or a guy is in there and nobody knows hes under a detainer order from berlin
9320303 no judge wants be on the front page of the paper having allowed lowered bail on a defendant only to learn hes been rearrested and no one knew none of us want that
9320304 it has the potential to impair the open police investigation

9320329 ow i think i need a fork and a knife it burns my fingers
9320330 yeah she mentioned that but there is no excuse for making anyone wait 3 min to be helped she could have transferred the call to someone else which btw once she actually disconnected me and i called back and got her again then someone else got on the phone after she put me on hold again and when i said i was placing an order with brandy she clicked me back to her or something and i told them that they should train their employees better before putting them on live calls and to cancel my order he actually sounded surprised and asked me for my address and since i had given her my number 3 times which as you know tells them who you are i told him that and to figure it out this is probably the last time i oder from this place though their pizza is good i have had better and can not stand crap service this pizza is damn good i had it delivered and it was so full of flavor crispy too even after the time in delivery box i appreciate their gourmet combos you gotta try it i seem to be having a bit of a dilemma on how to rate this place cause the pizza is good once it finally arrives i used to get extreme from the fillmore location they were fast efficient good no complaints i moved and thought okay no more extreme and then recently i get one of their brochure thingies in the mail nice ive never eaten inside i always get delivery the website says it takes 45 minutes for the order to arrive i believe that is a total lie because our pizza didnt arrive until over an hour and half later look guys i know youre trying to expand your business i understand but if it takes you that long to deliver to parkside maybe you shouldnt bother oh i forgot to mention this wasnt a one time thing it happened twice and im sure it would happen a third time cause you know everything happens in threes but im not a masochist im not ordering pizza from you again unless you can guarantee a speedier delivery or at least make it within your 45 minute time range this place has the best pizza ever combinations you would never think of on your own my favorite one is the ragin rooster they deliver but i try to eat there as much as possible because i have a thing for one of the employess i think his names max about 5 11

9320340 the first time i came here was a few years back the night of the marina challenge
9320341 lots of diversity two different floors lots of room to dance security was very friendly and the staff is awesome
9320342 if markell could put in place what he says he would he ought to be governor but personally i think carney will get the primary
9320343 im backing markell and it has been the most difficult decision of my life
9320344 the thing that swayed me is the exact same thing that is going on at the national level the climate of change at a crossroads like this i cant be a wimp and sit it out its time for a change
9320345 to them i say it may not be my turn but it is my time im in the right place at the right time delaware is ready for a message of change
9320346 all great change is leveraged off somebody or a group of people who can create that sense of urgency
9320347 the rate of change in this world is going up faster and faster and faster it affects everybody and as the rate of change goes up we need to make bigger leaps organizations dont like them but thats what leaders do throughout history they have helped people in difficult circumstances to take leaps in the right direction
9320348 the challenger though has free rein on the change slogan
9320349 obviously i bring change im not in the current administration some might see that as a better argument for the challenger it rings a little more true the fact that change is the buzzword with the presidential election will bode well for the challenger the person who is outside the administration who is not as closely associated with gov minner
9320350 they want to see change yes but they want to see results at the end of the day by the next governor im prepared to deliver those results and the leadership it takes he talks a lot about blaming the problems on me but he has been elected longer than i have and has had opportunity to address these challenges or raise them
9320351 he has had eight years to get things done and things havent changed
9320352 he is minners hand picked choice he has her authority and in her mind he is her partner this state needs to move in a different direction
9320353 elections are more about the future than they are about the past
9320354 what i would do as governor is not what the last governor has done what i have done as lieutenant governor is that ive been able to accomplish more as lieutenant governor than any prior person in that position
9320355 you have to prove you can make those decisions and not only react to them
9320356 john can certainly do that john and i dont always agree i think you can expect that but as far as the minner carney administration thats history
9320357 carney got the party endorsement but he didnt get a unanimous endorsement
9320358 the new people in district committees were not eager to endorse him from my vantage point there are a lot of old line committee members who either work for the state or are in a union or are the standard old line democratic crowd and then youve got this new blood coming out and the new blood doesnt necessarily agree with the old liners
9320359 carney brings proven leadership that will make change a reality
9320360 hes the man to take us to the next level as governor
9320361 lt gov john carney worked tirelessly to bring bluewater wind delmarva power and delawares state government together to make the first offshore wind power park in the nation a reality
9320362 he dug into details and made a case for offshore wind way before people even knew about it
9320363 when most of the political establishment was saying thats a fantasy thats not going to happen thats ridiculous there was some cost to him in terms of being out front on that when everyone else was saying its too expensive he was saying it makes financial sense
9320364 john took up the challenge but it was after it became very clear that there was a huge amount of public support for this project and it was safe politically
9320365 jack markell was the first statewide elected official to endorse the bluewater project and bluewater appreciates the role he played
9320366 many others federal officials also weighed in the ending was different thats when lt gov carney got very active and played a critical role in moving this project forward
9320367 its fair to say that the lieutenant governor got the ball over the goal line in support of the senate majority leaders initiative
9320368 i know john carney well and i like him personally but he is entrenched in old boy delaware politics he is someone who plans and is very methodical but he is indebted to politics as usual in the state indebted to the machine jack markell is not jack was stepping out long before there was any political benefit for him to do so i call that political courage and statesmanship
9320369 what ive observed is that hes a good decision maker hes a uniter not a divider
9320370 because of his manner and his style he has a lot of credibility with people hes working with and people he opposes
9320371 he is always moving always thinking always doing i think he knows where we need to go in the future
9320372 sometimes it takes patience and i think he has a lot of that
9320373 but dont underestimate him when its time to be bold and make a move john is a very good judge of that
9320374 their biggest hurdle is to differentiate one change from another
9320375 change probably does scare some people but the democratic party is embracing that idea right now
9320376 so i cant really review happy hound so we will leave it up to my dog
9320377 good bye dont let the door hit you on the way out
9320378 lots of diversity two different floors lots of room to dance security was very friendly and the staff is awesome
9320379 it has been a while since i wrote my previous review
9320380 next time you walk out you cant come back in
9320381 old soma well all that is gone and in its place is a slick new bar with nice hardwood floors flat screen tvs behind the bar and the promise of a dinner menu that will serve prime rib as its featured meal
9320382 of course people stood up and told the school board this stuff in march and they didnt listen the whole thing is a complete disaster they were promised transportation they have been given a choice in schools and that part is true but there is absolutely nothing being done to accommodate these kids in transportation
9320383 all they have to do is take a few minutes and open their ears and open their minds to find some solutions
9320384 we work around soldiers schedule to ensure their needs are met said phillips the lead dental technician and non commissioned officer in charge
9320385 we try our hardest to see soldiers before their convoy leaves even if that means extending our hours into the evening they are why we are here
9320386 weve been able to help soldiers save a lot of teeth prior to us getting here root canals would be started but follow up was never done
9320387 many of our patients are left over from our predecessors and were able to improve their oral hygiene through our capabilities
9320388 weve made a lot of smiles prettier people walk out smiling more
9320389 you do what you can with what you have you get the job done

9320403 a missing sense was originally conceived as a private tape to accompany my taking of lsd when in that particular state robert ashleys automatic writing was the only music i could actually experience without feeling claustrophobic and paranoid we played it endlessly it seemed to become part of the room perfectly blending with the late night city ambience and the breathing of the building

9320405 those who truly seek to understand and implement seo know it takes study a time investment and even some experimentation to achieve good results it also helps if you can follow the advice of someone who has already achieved that success actually that can make all the difference in the world when i began this blog i had no idea what i was doing i made every mistake in the book seo wise and i thought i didnt care whether i got traffic because i created wordplay as a showcase for my editorial consulting business i just wanted a blog that looked somewhat pretty and had interesting content that i could link to my company web site but then i made a few tweaks that brought me more traffic before long i was hooked on hits
9320406 a quick search of one of my favorite keyword tools tells me that the phrase
9320407 griz hes the guy who ranks on page one for make money online with his blogger blogspot blog ive been reading grizs blog for a while now and he knows his stuff in addition hes a legit internet marketer and a nice guy who likes helping people out hes more than proved his worth on his blog since he ranks for a whole range of make money online terms that hundreds of others would kill to rank for
9320408 google does not condone this but a lot of web masters buy and sell links seo specialists help you buy and sell links thats all they do so it makes sense to research up on the value of links when i first started out i couldnt believe how much john chow was making i didnt understand how it was possible but i now understand why he makes so much money its because he has a lot of noobie fans a lot of other mmo bloggers kiss his arse to get some of his crumbs this whole economy is supported by the ignorance of noobie bloggers
9320409 if youre spending a lot of time worrying about how flashy cool and hot your website or blog looks it may be costing you potential revenue
9320410 everyday therell be thousands of new bloggers coming out of the woodworks and you bet many have one main thing in mind how to make money online many of these bloggers are like regular visitors to the a list blogs you would think they have learned a lot from these visits but when you check them out at their own blogs one can conclude that theres a lot to be desired pretty dumb they must be wearing blinkers what can you do to be different and set yourself apart think differently out of the box and be more unique than what the masses are doing
9320411 there are thousands of blogs in the make money online niche most of them are poor and reading them will not help you learn how to make money at all every day new blogs are born with their writers either saying they can tell you the secrets of how to make money online or that they are blogging newbies who will tell you how they are learning to make money as they go along but fail miserably
9320412 lots of people turn to the internet as a way to make money online however the biggest problem people face is being overwhelmed by information they read read and read even more and the end result is total confusion months can go by with very little action being taken and when people do get started they seem to think that theyll make money fast this just isnt the case and if you think youll be able to give up your day job in a matter of a few weeks you are very much delusional unless of course you already have skills in internet marketing and seo etc
9320413 when i first started researching and learning how to blog i put a lot of time and effort into reading the traditional blogs about making money online one thing i realized was that none of them really taught me how to make money online out of the three hundred blogs that i read at the time not one blogger laid out a plan a true strategy for making money online most of what i learned centered around building readership rss and social media traffic so you can sell ad space it made sense at the time but selling ad space is not a strategy for making money online it is a strategy for selling ad space online
9320414 hey guys lets get together and screw the mmol serp
9320415 hello my name is phil removed and first i would like to thank you for what you do the knowledge i have picked up from your make money blog has taken me from someone that is sifting through envelope stuffing crap websites to being listed on the first page of google with multiple blogs using blogger since january im one of your readers that is silent never posting on your blog or emailing you because i know you are so busy unfortunately i have no other choice but to email you and ask a question since i am at a loss as to what is going on lately you have discussed on your blog about the serps being fluid and volatile and i have to confirm what you have said about this is true ive had a blog on the first page of google under my targeted keyword since early february never lower than the 5th position on the first page i place new articles fresh original content on the blog about as much as you update your make money blog and almost overnight i am finding myself on the sixth page of google for the past three days my question for you is have you come to any conclusion as to what is going on with google and do you have any opinion as to what googles requirement is now this blog is not a huge moneymaker but it does make money from adsesne daily and this has now gone to almost zero except for long tailed keywords that are a natural derivative of my main keyword any help or direction you could provide would be greatly appreciated i have taken your advice early on and stayed away from the make money niche or seo niche and concentrated all my efforts in niches outside these arenas and concentrated my efforts on products and services that are not associated with these two the only thing that i can think of that may have caused me to fall from the first page is i used duplicate content for a couple of recent articles to post news releases that were relevant to my niche if you have any idea please let me know when you have time
9320416 the short answer is no i havent figured this out yet the long answer is that it is pretty obvious that google has finally got around to cleaning up blogger for the most part it is blogspot com blogs that are being targeted and all the shuffling you are seeing is a result of this this isnt a big surprise though as blogger houses more spam sites than any other ip address and as such has had the most effect at manipulating the serps unfortunately we are just going to have to wait until things settle down if you havent been de indexed as of yet then you will probably be alright but your rankings may be lower than before this seems to be the trend at the moment i wish i could give you some better advice as to what you could do but aside from keeping your posting up and building new links there isnt much else to be done at the moment i would suggest that you dont use duplicate content and go back and re edit the duplicate posts you already have on your site change them enough so that when the bot comes by again that they would pass as original a question has your pr changed another did you only lose serp ranking on your main keyword are your longtails still ranking as well as they always have in the serps you have been getting backlinks are the anchors all for the same keyword or have you varied them are the backlinks pointing to various pages or just the homepage im sorry to trouble you with these questions but i have noticed that g only seems to be bouncing around my main keyword serp rankings and not my longtails this has me thinking that they may be targeting just certain keywords anyway thanks in advance and just sit tight for now if i come up with a plan of action i will be sure and post it
9320417 thank you so much for your quick response to answer your questions no i have not lost my page rank although it is presently 1 10 i still retain my page rank on the blog i will try varying my anchor text in articles i write since this may be one of the problems as ive only used two different forms of anchor text i have linked to some articles deep within my blog but out of over 170 blog post since late january maybe two of these articles are linked to with all of the rest all going to my home page this may be where i have dropped the ball ill concentrate on varying anchor text and linking to past articles on the blog to see if this helps me regain my position on page one of google the problem is i have read these techniques on your blog and as you can see i have failed to implement them to the degree required information overload over the past six months is probably the reason i must say
9320418 the variables are the data centers used and whether the page is a
9320419 doesnt that griz guy you talk to live around there
9320420 the troops assure me that they wont let the lodge go up in flames if for no other reason than they dont want to be sleeping in tents
9320421 lets gather round the fire and ill tell you a story
9320422 the story of how i made my way to the top of mount google and only got slapped twice
9320423 i have to read your stuff over and over because the methods in their madness are so detailed and complex and way beyond what my clueless brain could ever imagine
9320424 so what i can get my site indexed in record time by linking it to my pr 7 site submitting an article to the 7 million article directories and social bookmarking with the demon
9320425 for all of you who are busy trying to outrank my asiah blog and want to take home the 500 i suggest you join in on the forum discussion as that is where i will explain what i have done and how you can do it too
9320426 weve recently taken the step of applying nofollow to the links in hubs that have a hubscore below 50 and to all the hubs of authors with an author score below 75
9320427 weve recently taken the step of applying nofollow to the links in hubs that have a hubscore below 50 and to all the hubs of authors with an author score below 75
9320428 if i ever get my forum post done i will be dealing with this directly stay tuned
9320429 in order to use adsense through www hubpages com youll need to grant www hubpages com access to the ad code and reports in your
9320430 why do they need access to my reports april 07 2008 11 39 pm houston said hi grizz if i submit my url to site like www submitexpress com is it good or bad or better not too hope to hear from you soon p s i once used it before and i got some traffic from there houston april 07 2008 11 45 pm lissie said i can answer i love lego you need to give access to hubpages to your adsense id because they serve your id on your hubs for 60 of the impressions and their own id for the rest of the time you are therefore able to use adsense and analytics to track your traffic and adsense income direct rather than the more obscure system that squidoo uses for revenue sharing april 08 2008 6 17 am frank c said heres the suspension email i got from blogger dear blogger user this is a message from the blogger team your blog at http fenderduosonic blogspot com has been identified as a potential spam blog for an explanation of what spam blogs are please see blogger help http help blogger com bin answer py answer 42577 you will not be able to publish posts to your blog until we review your site and confirm that it is not a spam blog to request a review please fill out the form found here we will take a look at your blog and unlock it within four business days please note that if we do not hear from you within 20 days we will remove your blog if this blog does not belong to you then you

automatic spam detection is inherently fuzzy and occasionally a blog is flagged incorrectly we sincerely apologize for this erroneous result by using this kind of system however we can dedicate more storage bandwidth and engineering resources to users like you instead of to spammers thank you for your understanding and for your help in our spam fighting efforts sincerely the blogger team april 08 2008 6 49 am affiliate marketing said great article i love the way you write and your since of humor i will definitely look into getting my hub set up this weekend april 08 2008 7 16 am dennisjr said steve i agree we only one want one way links and hopefully with a little persuasion they will use our targeted keyword my intent was to create a post or page that is specifically for reciprocal links this way when they want the reciprocal link they have a place to find it additionally i also plan on removing the link however if they come back to my page and ask why i removed it i would put it back i was just curios to see if grizz or anyone has tried this april 08 2008 7 24 am dennisjr said grizz update you wanted me to let you know the outcome after i changed my words to get the ads i wanted and the traffic it appears my editing and readjustments finally came to fruitation i am finally getting traffic amp clicks for that niche you looked at for those that may be new i was getting traffic to a niche but my adsense was not giving me the ads that reflected my niche i changed things around and got my ads but lost my traffic in the end after editing and reediting my post they both came together as friar said earlier persistence it pays april 08 2008 7 54 am grizzly brears said sorry for the absence folks had to get a few things done elsewhere dennis you are talking about a reciprocal linking page and this is common practice with many sites you can join programs like linkmetro com owned bt brad callen seo elite and linkmarket net in order to find others willing to do a two way link exchange you can game both of these programs by signing up and waiting for others to contact you about exchanging links if they contact you first they have to give you a link first you then agree to the exchange and are supposed to link back to them dont this is being a prick but it gets you a one way link until the other site finally realizes that you arent going to link back some will remove their link to you but most never notice because they are busy getting 100s of these links and dont check i should mention that these are all low quality links as most of these sites set up a page like you mention and give out 100s of links totally diluting any pr value but a link is a link do not ever link back to any of these sites many of them are bad neighborhood sites and you will be penalized for linking to them you arent penalized if they link to you one last thing i should mention to everyone any link even un targeted crappy links or two way links are still better than no links i talk about spending time getting the best links as they are far more effective but if you can get 1000s of crappy links you will end up on top of the serps eventually it just takes a lot longer in my niche make money online bidvertiser is now number 1 and it doesnt have many targeted keyword links but it does have thousands and thousands of links from all the sites displaying its ads i have a fraction of the links they have but i rank on page 1 as well because mine are targeted my way is faster and to me easier than collecting 1000s of crappy links but both systems will work to look natural you do need crappy links as well it would be suspicious if every link i had used the same keyword ok long answer to a simple question yes dennis you can do what you are suggesting lol april 08 2008 11 25 am grizzly brears said gotafish i assume you have seen franks email april 08 2008 11 29 am grizzly brears said steve see my reply to dennis above with regard to two way links you can see your links using googles webmasters tools and yahoos site explorer once they have found them the only program i use that will show you all your backlinks which i recommend to anyone pursuing a serious online business is seo elite steve never click around or you could get the person you are trying to help in trouble thanks though but repaying me isnt necessary april 08 2008 11 35 am grizzly brears said i love lego see lissies explanation i should point out that i am not interested in the adsense income and didnt give them my account april 08 2008 11 37 am grizzly brears said houston i am not familiar with that program but will check it out and get back to you april 08 2008 11 39 am grizzly brears said thanks frank the last time i got flagged i didnt get an email just a captcha and note on the bottom of my blog i wanted to see what they are doing now as i suspected you could have been flagged by the machine and not a person hard to tell you shouldnt have trouble passing the review though please let me know how it turns out i will try a similar blog and see if it gets by or not april 08 2008 11 42 am grizzly brears said dennis again glad to see you worked things out now you know the secret to adsense traffic and the right keywords april 08 2008 11 44 am gotafish said i tried a new ebay affiliate site on ebay last night and it got flagged spam this am so looks like they are flagging them for the excessive outbound links to ebay the other site ive had up and running for a while hasnt been bothered yet april 08 2008 12 35 pm aravind said hi griz how r u man im getting 100 unique visits daily to my indian premier league blog i posted a few ads to that blog through adsense but im not able to generate clicks do you have any sugesstions to generate clicks april 08 2008 12 38 pm grizzly brears said gotafish thanks for the update fish your intuition sounds right and is a likely explanation ill know more once i have mine up and running at least we know it wasnt a malicious reader as you didnt leave a link it appears that blogger has a much more sophisticated system in place which isnt surprising with g at the helm april 08 2008 4 13 pm grizzly brears said aravind as soon as i have a minute ill drop by and take a peek you might play with your keywords in the meantime use post titles that while on topic also generate a variety of ads and see if there is a vein that works for your readers dennis if you want to go over what you did with your site please be my guest april 08 2008 4 16 pm dennisjr said aravind are you getting ads that relate to your niche where are you placing your ads if your getting the correct ads i would try changing the location your ad placement as long as you continue to get the 100 unique a day you should be able to get an idea of whats working i currently have mine on top below the banner and to the left however i think it may be against adsense tos having it below the header it almost looks like a part of the post you may want to try to change the color scheme i remember vic saying he would make his site black with gray font and neon links however make sure it is legible so you dont get nailed for violation of adense tos basically i kept playing around until i started getting results also are people sitting on your site for a long time april 08 2008 6 16 pm dinheiro said grizzly do you use bans vic advice to have some bans sites and if youve do you use adsense with bans im seeing people saying that adsense dont like bans sites and are banning users because of that for the hubpages after 24h ive a 85 score for the profile and 83 for the hub and the hub is indexed by google now i want to see in the next 4 weeks how much traffic that hub can get ill not do link promotion just to see how poweful hubpages can be april 08 2008 6 53 pm steve said hey grizz quick question this time do i need to worry about leaving backlinks to their sites in my comment section i thought i heard blogger no follows all links but not sure if they are good bad or indifferent thanks steve april 08 2008 8 12 pm i love lego said lizzie and griz thanks but why do they need my reports i can understand my adsense code but not my reporting i can answer i love lego you need to give access to hubpages to your adsense id because they serve your id on your hubs for 60 of the impressions and their own id for the rest of the time you are therefore able to use adsense and analytics to track your traffic and adsense income direct rather than the more obscure system that squidoo uses for revenue sharing april 08 2008 9 18 pm aravind said griz tnks for the reply ill be waiting for ur next reply dennis im not getting relavant ads when im using the custom channels some unrelavant ads are being posted can we select which ads to be posted how to place the ads below the header april 08 2008 9 26 pm amit said as far as aravind goes i believe the niche he has selected the indian premier league is not very good since it is related to cricket and that game is played in only a few nations apart from the fact that indians usually do not buy anything from the net because of unreliablity of service and danger of being duped by the unscruplous online shops the only people who visit the indian premier league kind of blogs are people who are looking for some nice information to read just like news etc and hence the clicks would be minimal apart from the fact that i have not seen any adevrtisers as yet for indian premier league so of course the ads you must be getting will be like watch live cricket
9320431 damn i wish i had known that you couldnt create a brand and make money online using blogspot before i went out and used blogspot to creat more search traffic than all the a list combined in the make money online niche stupid me ah but im no authority john is
9320432 if i would have just worked a little bit harder like john said i could have made more selling this ill try harder next time
9320433 this post isnt aimed at people trying to sell their blog its aimed at the people thinking of buying one

9320453 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
9320454 anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
9320455 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
9320456 the issue of settlement building is not just that they exist on occupied land in the west bank and occupied east jerusalem its about control over water and the territorial contiguity of any possible future palestinian state
9320457 its difficult for palestinians to have any confidence in the committment to reach a solution when settlement activity has almost doubled and by the palestinain count more than doubled
9320458 more effort should be put in order to further reduce

9320503 denn wir glauben dass die motorenfrage bei den indycars eine riesige chance darstellt
9320504 denn der rumpfmotor eines solchen triebwerks k nnte in zukunft auch als basismotor f r verschiedene sport und tourenwagenserien dienen wenn man einen motor mit nur leichten anpassungen in diversen serien einsetzen kann spart dies geld und macht die sache f r hersteller attraktiv
9320505 ich wusste dass es eine sache zwischen scott und mir werden w rde es war sehr eng zwischen uns auf der zweiten runde habe ich versucht ein wenig vorauszusehen wie sich die strecke wohl mit den h rteren reifen verhalten w rde und wir haben kleine ver nderungen vorgenommen aber diese modifikationen haben leider daf r gesorgt dass das auto ein wenig schwieriger wurde und mehr bersteuerte
9320506 wir sind den schritt wieder zur ckgegangen und sind noch mal rausgefahren das hat uns dann definitiv gezeigt dass der zuvor eingeschlagene weg falsch war in dem langsameren abschnitt den kurven vier f nf und sechs hatte das auto zu wenig grip um schnell einlenken zu k nnen
9320507 leider hat das dann f r die l cke zwischen scott und mir gesorgt ich habe wirklich alles versucht ich habe so hart attackiert wie nur m glich leider ist uns eine bessere zeit aber nicht gelungen platz zwei ist nicht so schlecht im grunde genommen ist er sogar sehr gut wir werden morgen alles tun was wir k nnen um das rennen morgen zu gewinnen
9320508 es ist etwas entt uschend ich war mit der balance nicht zu 100 prozent zufrieden wir haben hart daran gearbeitet und haben auf jeden fall einiges dabei erzielt
9320509 wieder in den top 6 zu landen ist eine tolle sache es war eine gute teamleistung von penske und das hat uns f r das rennen in eine gute position gebracht wir waren dieses jahr auf allen stra enkursen extrem gut das zeigt einfach die best ndigkeit unserer konkurrenzf higkeit
9320510 ich wusste dass man hier kaum berholen kann deshalb lag mein fokus auf dem start den wollte ich unbedingt gut hingekommen und vor jean karl vernay aus der ersten kurve heraus kommen was mir gelungen ist in den ersten runden habe ich versucht den abstand zu jean karl zu vergr ern danach bin ich das rennen ruhig nach hause gefahren
9320511 ich habe eine gro e blase an der linken hand deshalb bin ich froh das rennen berhaupt auf dem podest beendet zu haben franck mailleux start war besser und weil er im rennen keinen fehler machte hatte ich keine chance mehr auf den sieg mein rennen war gut der start leider nicht
9320512 nach dem start war mein rennen eigentlich schon gelaufen ich konnte zwar zu jean karl vernay aufschlie en aber wann immer ich nah an ihm dran war verlor ich den anpressdruck und mein auto rutschte herum der dritte platz ist ein gutes ergebnis zumal ich nun wieder dritter in der gesamtwertung bin
9320513 es war ein recht stressiger tag wir h tten nicht gedacht dass wir es unter die schnellsten sechs schaffen w rden wir waren sehr schnell und alles ist recht prima verlaufen aber uns ist in der ersten session kaum eine zeit gelungen
9320514 es bestand also das risiko es nicht in die n chste runde zu schaffen erst ganz am ende ist uns eine gute zeit gegl ckt und wir sind unter die besten zw lf geschl pft in der n chsten session waren wir dann die dritten ich war mit meiner runde im qualifying der top 6 nicht ganz zufrieden aber ich denke dass wir da das meiste daraus machen werden und mit meinem teamkollegen hoffentlich das rennen auf dem podium beenden werden
9320515 es war ein ganz gute session und der wagen war sehr gut am ende des tages hatte ich fast das gef hl dass uns etwas die luft ausgeht aber wir sind gl cklich es in die top 6 geschafft zu haben

9320528 i dont appreciate having my name or my words or for that matter sen bidens words used theres nothing i can do about it except speak out against it and hope people wont give it any credence
9320529 last night barack obama was officially nominated democratic candidate for president of the united states and i want to tell you something i really think things are starting to look bad for hillary
9320530 former president bill clinton spoke at the convention last night and it was sort of sad when in the middle of clintons speech john mccain wandered out on stage in his bathrobe
9320531 oh this is exciting john mccain now has finally decided on his vice president yeah the only question now is from which house will he make the announcement
9320532 and john kerry said well this time were going to win hey thats good enough for me
9320533 and then tonight barack obama speaks to the convention and they moved it to the stadium there in denver theyre getting like 75 000 people and im telling you the construction crew has been working around the clock painting the stadium scrubbing the stadium plastering its the same team that works on nancy pelosi
9320534 political experts say that john mccain is going to try to steal attention away from the democrats tonight by leaking the name of his running mate experts say theres a pretty good chance that mccain will leak something else too
9320535 last night at the democratic convention bill and hillary clinton were in an elevator when it got stuck between floors for five minutes
9320536 barack obama says hes planning to get his daughters a dog if hes elected president most voters asked think he should get a poodle proving that americans are not only ready for a black president theyre also ready for a gay first dog
9320537 tomorrow this is a little fun fact for you both john mccain and michael jackson will celebrate their birthday yeah so it will be the birthday of an old white guy and john mccain
9320538 quite a historic day barack obama accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states barack gave his speech on the historic anniversary of martin luther kings i have a dream speech and just two days after hillary clinton gave her i had a dream speech
9320539 and last night during his speech bill clinton promised to do everything he could to help barack obama win the election
9320540 thats nice but you know bill keeping promises is not his strong suit
9320541 at one point this week police in denver had a showdown with over 300 protesters ended up pepper spraying them and since of course it was denver and they were democrats it was only fresh ground pepper spray
9320542 and john mccain has apparently chosen his vice president he was going to announce who it was but then he forgot well there was a rumor that mccain might pick former ebay c e o meg whitman as his running mate that makes sense you know shes an expert at selling americans really old stuff

9321067 it wouldnt surprise me if we get them in the fa cup too
9321068 the fans may prefer to win that one and lose three or four around it but we are treating it as the third round in the carling cup where we havent been for many years
9321069 i understand what it means for the fans and everything we do is for the fans
9321070 its a special game for them and we are going to treat it the same way as they want
9321071 but its important that we realise its a football game and its a huge football occasion and it shouldnt go any further
9321072 the respect should be there and for the youngsters it will be the first time many will see the teams play an official game so we should make it an example for the future

9321093 i dont know if there is anything to getting the ball and having first crack at it or giving it up and having that first possession in the second half
9321094 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not

9321114 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9321115 cuando rusia tiene un motivo de queja sobre temas como osetia del sur deber a actuar multilateralmente con consentimiento m s que unilateralmente por la fuerza
9321116 mi mensaje a rusia es simple si quiere ser bienvenido en organismos como el g8 la organizaci n para la cooperaci n econ mica y el desarrollo oecd y la organizaci n mundial del comercio omc debe aceptar que esos derechos conllevan responsabilidades
9321117 queremos que rusia sea un buen integrante del g8 y otras organizaciones pero no podemos elegir las reglas a las que nos adherimos o no
9321118 es por esto que ma ana discutir si rusia debe aceptar la integridad del territorio de georgia los mecanismos internacionales para gestionar estos conflictos y retirar las tropas a sus posiciones previas
9321119 en cuanto a la luz de las acciones rusas la ue deber a revisar de ra z su relaci n con rusia
9321120 tambi n estamos reflexionando sobre la respuesta de la otan debemos reevaluar las alianzas con rusia e intensificar nuestro apoyo a georgia y otros que pudieran sufrir la agresi n rusa
9321121 debemos construir r pidamente relaciones con otros productores de petr leo y gas
9321122 creo que tenemos que dejar claro nuestra inconformidad sobre la manera en que rusia ha actuado
9321123 pero haciendo esto de una forma determinada y un lenguaje en particular estamos conduciendo a rusia al aislamiento y ser m s dif cil negociar con una rusia enojada y aislada
9321124 y por eso cuando la gente habla sobre su expulsi n del g8 y cosas de este tipo creo que no comprenden las posibles consecuencias que esto puede tener en la actitud del gobierno ruso
9321125 rusia se ha convertido en un agresor ha defendido el pasaporte ruso en regiones de georgia con nimo de romper la unidad del estado demostrando un desprecio por los principios de las relaciones internacionales modernas
9321126 mi instinto inmediato y el del primer ministro fue claro manifestarnos en contra de la agresi n exigir un respeto por los derechos humanos y la normativa internacional e impulsar una ideolog a mundial en favor de estos principios
9321127 poner fin a los intentos de usar la situaci n en torno a georgia para elevar tensiones en europa especulando unas amenazas no existentes sobre otros pa ses ex sovi ticos

9321129 an increase in the levels of cryptosporidium has been detected through our routine water quality sampling programme this has prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9321130 extensive further water sampling is required and so at this stage it is not known how long the boil water notice will be in force
9321131 we are advising gps in the area to report any cases of diarrhoea and to take samples to be tested for gastrointestinal infections such as cryptosporidium
9321132 the national public health service is closely monitoring the levels of illness in the area supplied by the water
9321133 these two have been very consistent especially kulasekara and this is what happens when you give opportunities to youngsters

9321136 if you are coming into university with not very good qualifications and do an arts degree at a low ranked university you are not really doing yourself any favours
9321137 but you are under the impression that if you have a degree youre really employable
9321138 i didnt see it university could be massively useful but my tutor said youve kind of got to go so you may as well pick something that vaguely interests you
9321139 the programme is targeted mainly at those who made a decision not to go to university because of the debts they would incur
9321140 having a workforce with graduate level skills has never been more important to economic success
9321141 there are also nonfinancial benefits for graduates who tend to have better jobs and healthier lifestyles be more involved in their childrens education and be more tolerant and active citizens
9321142 we think the qaly is woefully inadequate as a measure of patient benefit
9321143 it will be very difficult for any new cancer drug to pass the test because they have very high research and development costs and with the kidney cancer drugs there is a relatively small number of patients so the cost per patients to recover the r amp d costs are fairly high
9321144 it is absolutely essential that some allowance is made for the increase in the nhs budget and the fact the medical inflation is running at about 10 per cent a year at the moment
9321145 we believe it is too low in the context of other areas of government expenditure and in comparison to the amount of money spent on new drugs by our european counterparts
9321146 additionally it does not take into account inflation since the threshold was first used
9321147 we have commissioned research to assess whether our current threshold range is reasonable or whether it should be altered and the findings will be discussed fully at a workshop next january

9321157 we got a find a way to get this guy on the field hes that good
9321158 i cant think of a single operator in the top 15 that isnt looking at this issue carefully

9321160 we are actively exploring new and evolving technologies for bandwidth management factoring in the new guidance provided by the fcc and we will continue to communicate openly with our customers about the methods we use to ensure a high quality online experience
9321161 engage in the types of p2p traffic management used by comcast
9321162 we dont see any need to change any of our current network management practices
9321163 theyve reinforced that there remains a justification for reasonable network management
9321164 its managing the network in a fair and efficient fashion in a way that benefits the widest number of users
9321165 we think transparency is really key its good for consumers
9321166 its about giving consumers more choice and they pick the best plan
9321167 although comcasts terms of use statement may have specified that its broadband internet
9321168 the no 1 challenge is to make sure nobody is surprised by the new plan
9321169 that indicates people are not at their computers so theyre not noticing the drop in bandwidth
9321170 what were trying to do is just smooth out the peaks but not reduce bandwidth to such a point where youre leaving network resources idle

9321213 there have been smaller distribution companies interested in distributing the films
9321214 i will come back at a later date and show part two of the trilogy which premiered in sundance in 2007 it is fine everything is fine it is important to show what is it first because it sets up thinking about taboo subject matter to that when people view it is fine everything is fine the taboo element is not what becomes important but the emotional content of the film the two films have thematic similaries but are very different kinds of films it is fine everything is fine note the period is part of the title very much deals with the emotional catharsis of the main character who is played by the author of the screenplay steven c stewart who was born with a severe case of cerebral palsy steven had written his screenplay in the late 1970s i read it in 1986 and as soon as i had read it i knew i had to produce the film steve had been locked in a nursing home for about 10 years when his mother died because of his palsy he was very difficult to understand people that were caring for him in the nursing home would derisively call him m r for mental retard this is not a nice thing to say to anyone but steve was of normal intelligence when he did get out he wrote his screenplay although it is written in the genre of a murder detective thriller truths of his own existence come through much more clearly than if he had written it as a standard autobiography i am very proud of the film as i am of what is it i feel it is fine everything is fine will probably be the best film i will have anything to do with in my entire career part three will not be shot for quite some time and it will not be the next film that i shoot

9321246 second the impact of co2 is nonlinear in the sense that each added unit contributes less than its predecessor for example if doubling co2 from its value in the late nineteenth century from about 290 parts per million by volume ppmv to 580 ppmv causes a 2 percent increase in radiative forcing then to obtain another 2 percent increase in radiative forcing we must increase co2 by an additional 580 ppmv rather than by another 290 ppmv at present the concentration of co2 is about 380 ppmv

9321318 i think that gov palin is a compelling person shes got a great story
9321319 i think you guys can take a look at gov palins and joe bidens record and make your own judgments in terms of who you think has what it takes to be an outstanding vice president
9321320 republicans rightfully have criticized the democratic nominee sen barack obama for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison

9321329 leave the heroic tales of past strikes and picket line battles for the history books
9321330 forget about anachronisms like a jobs bank that pays people for not working
9321331 join with management to tell the world about the great skills and work ethic of michigan workers team with company leaders and state officials to tell the story of productive flexible workforces willing to make tremendous changes and sacrifices just as the uaw has done with health care costs and job classifications in the 2007 contract
9321332 senator mccain has made a truly impressive choice in naming sarah palin as his running mate what we are seeing is a maverick who has shaken up washington picking a teammate a maverick who has brought reform to her own state
9321333 in her scant two years as governor she has lobbied aggressively to open up the anwr to drilling pushed for even more drilling off of alaskas coasts and put special interests above science
9321334 my running mate should have the qualifications to immediately step into the role of commandeer in chief

9321371 we are of course well aware that several conclusions of the ivir studies do not agree with the policy choices underlying the commissions proposals and we are certainly not so nave as to expect that the recommendations of an academic institution such as ours however well researched and conceived they may be will find their way into the commissions policies in undiluted form what we would expect however is that our work which was expressly commissioned by the policy unit in charge of these proposals be given the appropriate consideration by the commission and be duly referenced in its policy documents in particular wherever the commissions policy choices depart from our studies main recommendations as you are certainly aware one of the aims of the better regulation policy that is part of the lisbon agenda is to increase the transparency of the eu legislative process by wilfully ignoring scientific analysis and evidence that was made available to the commission upon its own initiative the commissions recent intellectual property package does not live up to this ambition indeed the commissions obscuration of the ivir studies and its failure to confront the critical arguments made therein seem to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the parliament as well as the citizens of the european union in doing so the commission reinforces the suspicion already widely held by the public at large that its policies are less the product of a rational decision making process than of lobbying by stakeholders this is troublesome not only in the light of the current crisis of faith as regards the european lawmaking institutions but also and particularly so in view of european citizens increasingly critical attitudes towards intellectual property law

9321378 every time we sat down for coffee he was right there taking pictures of me little things like that freak you out when you arent feeling great anyway
9321379 ive not brought it out for people to use as a self help book to say this is how you cope with anxiety and depression
9321380 its just to get it out in the open there have been so many questions left unanswered and ive not helped that process but this is the opportunity and i hope people can understand why i did a few things i did
9321381 i remember those interviews i wasnt looking forward to them but id dealt with the process for such a long time you get through those processes
9321382 i didnt want to admit to people it wasnt as good as i wanted it to be because i wanted to make sure i could stay on the tour

9321384 the situation i was in it was just going to get worse i didnt want to say to people ive missed out again it was a tough pill to swallow
9321385 the words that i speak you convince yourself that everythings ok but eventually it cracks and then i knew midway through that match at sydney i was gone and that was enough
9321386 i struggled mostly with the nerves and the worrying that goes with it it doesnt matter what you do anybody can pick it up whether you earn 1m a year or 20 a week
9321387 it strikes when it wants to and theres not much you can do until you take pills or seek help and get back on the road to recovery
9321388 but you try to cope with those pressures then when you get to that point when you are trying to deal with everything when you are stuck in a hotel in baroda india or sydney without the support network of your family you realise you dont need to be like that
9321389 when you worry about external stuff in cricket you struggle for runs if you are not mentally switched on behind the scenes then youve got no chance on the pitch
9321390 people try and hide it all the time i hid it for weeks months and a couple of years before saying i dont want to run from this any more
9321391 anxiety problems are seen as a weakness people tell you to pull yourself together but it is an illness its not something you make up
9321392 the pressure of travelling in the winter is a major pressure trying to get to abu dhabi in the winter for the somerset tour earlier this year was the worst of it
9321393 its not worth the hassle of making me poorly but in england i can travel for three weeks away at a time because you know that you are a maximum of three hours away from home
9321394 and after a long hard day at taunton i can go home and put the kids to bed and that means so much to me

9321403 i always struggled since i was 10 11 going away from home on school trips
9321404 it continued on cricket trips all the way through until id had enough
9321405 i was in despair really i didnt feel comfortable wherever i went whether in my room downstairs having a drink with the lads or going out into town i was always looking over my shoulder
9321406 every time we sat down for coffee he was right there taking pictures of me little things like that freak you out when you arent feeling great anyway
9321407 ive not brought it out for people to use as a self help book to say this is how you cope with anxiety and depression
9321408 its just to get it out in the open there have been so many questions left unanswered and ive not helped that process but this is the opportunity and i hope people can understand why i did a few things i did
9321409 i remember those interviews i wasnt looking forward to them but id dealt with the process for such a long time you get through those processes
9321410 i didnt want to admit to people it wasnt as good as i wanted it to be because i wanted to make sure i could stay on the tour

9321456 we think the qaly is woefully inadequate as a measure of patient benefit
9321457 it will be very difficult for any new cancer drug to pass the test because they have very high research and development costs and with the kidney cancer drugs there is a relatively small number of patients so the cost per patients to recover the r amp d costs are fairly high
9321458 it is absolutely essential that some allowance is made for the increase in the nhs budget and the fact the medical inflation is running at about 10 per cent a year at the moment
9321459 we believe it is too low in the context of other areas of government expenditure and in comparison to the amount of money spent on new drugs by our european counterparts
9321460 additionally it does not take into account inflation since the threshold was first used
9321461 we have commissioned research to assess whether our current threshold range is reasonable or whether it should be altered and the findings will be discussed fully at a workshop next january
9321462 this government has been caught out deliberately fudging the true number of public hospital beds by changing the definition of bed

9321533 the journey throughout the series has been totally fantastic and surreal and to share it with the boys from the choir is great and to win is totally amazing
9321534 we had a party in the bbc last night after the show but had to come back to cardiff and arrived at 3am on sunday
9321535 its another busy day weve done a radio show with aled jones and then will be recording songs of praise in the afternoon
9321536 i think that the standard of every choir in the final was very high and it says a lot about wales having two choirs there at the end

9321538 we really not sure whats to come but hope its a start of something new

9321546 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9321547 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9321548 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9321549 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9321550 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9321551 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9321552 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9321553 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9321554 but do they realise that a child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention

9321557 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
9321558 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
9321559 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
9321560 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
9321561 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here

9321563 texture is an often overlooked element of design but it is one of the most important features in my work i strive to create patterns that reinforce what the natural food item might feel like to the fish examples include meaty soft chewy and crunchy on the outside all represent textures that would provide an extra positive reaction to your fly most of the patterns in the book emphasize a meaty and chewy texture if the fish hold onto the fly longer because of a positive reaction to texture you will have a longer chance to set the hook
9321564 to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all
9321565 35 human rights watch hrw reported that during 2006 and 2007 bahraini authorities citing law 32 2006 banned meetings and on several occasions forcibly prevented or dispersed unauthorized gatherings the national committee for martyrs and victims of torture ncmvt reported that in many documented cases during the last four years citizens arrested in relation to unauthorized gatherings or protests had complained of being severely assaulted during arrest being placed in isolation for periods from three to fifteen days being subjected to torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment during interrogation and being kept in detention for a long period during interrogation or trial in most cases the arrestees were accused by the police of using violence but eventually found guilty of participating in unregistered organizations in all cases following internal and external campaigns the detainees were released without a trial or through royal amnesty detainees access to attorneys is often restricted in the early stages of detention attorneys must seek a court order to confer with clients other ngos added that the ministry has never investigated such abuses or penalized the offenders and that it protects officials who abuse rights holders 36 hrw noted that on september 15 2006 police prevented an ngo from holding a public seminar on the groups petition calling for a new constitution on the basis that the group had not sought permission from the ministry of the interior on september 22 when the group tried a second time to hold the meeting police used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the gathering reportedly wounding several people in several instances the police used what appeared to be excessive force and inflicted severe beatings on persons they seized sometimes amounting to torture on may 20 2007 police reportedly fired rubber bullets at a gathering at which opposition political figures including members of parliament were speaking injuring the leader of the opposition national democratic action society the next evening in an incident that hrw investigated riot police confronted a street demonstration protesting the may 20 incident and separately seized two individuals the officers beat both of them severely inflicting serious injuries on both and authorities held one of them for more than a week in undisclosed locations while refusing to acknowledge to his family that he was in the state custody other ngos added that protests against the confiscation of the almalkia village sea shores were quelled by anti riot police with many casualties
9321566 f the apparent failure to investigate promptly impartially and fully the numerous allegations of torture and ill treatment and to prosecute alleged offenders and in particular the pattern of impunity for torture and other ill treatment committed by law enforcement personnel in the past
9321567 d consider steps to amend decree no 56 of 2002 to ensure that there is no impunity for officials who have perpetrated or acquiesced in torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9321568 offences that endangered or pose a threat to state national security
9321569 20 as the national committee for martyrs and victims of torture ncmvt noted in 2006 it in cooperation with the bahrain center for human rights other ngos and members of the national assembly formed the coalition for truth equity and reconciliation however despite the urgent need to form a national committee for truth and reconciliation as demanded by civil society organizations ngos reported that the government claims that there is no need for such a committee because they have addressed the issue of the victims of the past
9321570 there were no known instances of officials being punished for human rights abuses committed controversy continued over impunity for alleged torturers which the government maintained was granted by the 2001 general amnesty
9321571 in order to ensure that the perpetrators of torture and ill treatment do not enjoy impunity the state party shall ensure the investigation and where appropriate the prosecution of all those accused of having committed such acts
9321572 each state party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible in the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of torture his dependants shall be entitled to compensation

9321723 half of the green pixels are omitted and the nearest set of rgb pixels are assumed to be co sited but theyre not to produce an rgb image with half the resolution of the original this is very good and quick and as its a downsample without a downsampling filter applied very sharp but on the downside there can be fringes on colors and some aliases its a good compromise for quick playback

9321725 marty didnt want to film a rolling stones concert in a huge arena there have been many rolling stones concert films mostly in stadiums and large venues he wanted a smaller more intimate stage and thats where the idea to film in the beacon theater in new york was conceived this gave marty a chance to show these guys for who they are and lend an immediacy to the performances its really a very positive and exciting film about how these four guys go out and make music they are the real deal with mick singing and moving around on the stage like a 20 year old and keith ronnie and charlie going out there every night with great passion that really comes across in marty has a very clear vision of what he wants as a director hes a great film historian and is inspired by a lot of films but at the same time he always wants to do something fresh marty decided that adding the element of comedy would give a concert film something different another way to see rock n roll the behind the scenes footage and the archival clips are often funny
9321726 getting to the two hour length was an intuitive process we had planned to lose one song since the entire performance would otherwise be too long that was easy but then it turned out that we actually had to lose two songs which was a tough decision at least people will get to see them in the dvd extras
9321727 sparkle bob richardsons preferred colorist at complete post transferred all the film dailies to hdcam sr tape in the 10 bit rgb 4 4 4 mode which becomes the equivalent of a digital negative he also provided sd dailies for david to capture into the avid during the course of the editing we would take davids avid sequence and boil down the nearly 300 source tapes into only two main source tapes these were basically clones of the originals so there was no quality loss in this step
9321728 i had to use the multicam feature all along the way and that simply works best on adrenaline when you stay in standard definition i needed the responsiveness for marty and by staying in standard def we were able to see nine camera angles at any given time playing back in real time we did our screenings in high definition though using avids dnxhd 175 resolution we would do these screenings at least once a month and sometimes once a week the image looked wonderful
9321729 every decision was incremental the band also believed in martys vision although they had their own insights into the material we flew to italy with bob clearmountain to screen it for the stones while they were on tour the screening was at technicolors screening room in rome and luckily it was a great sounding room
9321730 as we made picture changes it would impact the mix generally marty would try to accentuate an instrument in the mix if it was featured in a shot so bob clearmountain ended up doing a number of remixes to adjust to our various versions its a great track and all of the concert sound in the film comes from the live recording in order to get the truest reaction during our screenings we would present the film in 5 1 surround i was lucky to have nick damiano as my first assistant he used to work at sony studios in new york and knows the audio world extremely well so he was able to help communicate with clearmountain as well as prepare the avid timeline for our 5 1 screenings nick was especially helpful in the tricky sound transitions between the documentary sections and the concert
9321731 i was on the project during the production at pinewood studios is england working in tandem with the filming at times tim would need to shorten or lengthen a song to enhance the drama of a scene which might include adding or removing a few bars of music michael higham music producer supervising music editor and i would make these musical edits for the playback on set occasionally id speed up or slow down the music slightly to match the drama we didnt want to change the drama to match the track but rather let the acting take precedence later the final version would be scored to reflect these changes sync was a challenge in performance since there were lots of takes id often have to slide shots to adjust for better lipsync to the track since i was cutting in tandem with the filming schedule tim would review my cuts on a saturday and make adjustments the following week based on this stage in the film i didnt have to adjust a lot for overall cinematic pacing because each song really has a pace of its own
9321732 i cut the film on avid systems in london i love avids for what i do and have only cut on them but im most comfortable with the older meridien systems because they feel more responsive to me than the newer avid media composer adrenalines we did also had adrenalines in our mix of cutting rooms which were used to do an hd conform of my cut for internal screenings media composer systems have the advantage of being able to track several different timecode signals since all the performance takes were based on a common playback track of the song the assistants were able to load the dailies including the timecode of the corresponding playback track for the song this enabled me to quickly match different takes against each other at the same point in a song using that timecode for reference
9321733 as an editor you never had to deal with color correction but now people expect it for the final theatrical release though the film has gone through the digital intermediate process with stefan sonnenfeld of company 3 handling the final color grading of the film tim went for a look thats dark and desaturated except that certain colors are accentuated specifically the red of the blood and in the frill on mrs lovitts dress and we kept sacha baron cohens introduction scene brighter in keeping with the comedic tone of the scene another advantage of modern systems is how they handle visual effects on d j vu we sent a lot of simpler effects like blue screens and set extensions to adobe after effects one of the assistants was really a whiz at it saving us 60 000
9321734 ive probably worked more closely with tim on this film than any others he makes quick decisions which was good on this film you have to consider this a low budget production by major studios standards given the nature of the subject matter an r rated musical horror film there were no reshoots needed and since i had been cutting on the same schedule as the filming i was only about three set ups behind when the film wrapped i was able to do this by starting the cut of a scene using the video assist tapes and then replace those shots when i received the transferred footage since tim was very involved in the cutting room during the production nothing was a surprise to him as we finished the cut tim took the usual ten weeks to get a directors cut and then a couple of more weeks to address notes from the studios and stephen sondheim in fact tims biggest concern was that sondheim would be happy with the effort he was thrilled

9321742 kids that were 7 or 8 years old they put some moves on him he was getting in a linebacker stance but he was like theyre running circles around me he had his hands on his hips after that

9321744 for me that was the highlight of the trip just to be able to see so many kids eager to learn
9321745 ive never seen someone so anxious to get on the computer because again most of the people i see have computers available i mean computers are all over this campus but there the computers that we gave them that could change their lives
9321746 and theyre smart too we were helping them with a typing program and they picked it up like this crum snapping his fingers for effect getting the home keys down and pretty soon its like man i cant even type like this i was very thrilled and excited to be a part of that
9321747 were really really close friends so he knows me extremely well and ive got a big heart
9321748 and i know mo to be somebody who genuinely cares about other people and mo is someone whos committed to excellence when mo is a part of something no matter what it is it occupies him all of that combined it was a no brainer for me to seek out mo
9321749 i was kind of bandas go to guy i gave him a lot of input on how i thought things would work or how i thought doing things a certain way would affect the outcome
9321750 i kind of feel like me and abdel always say its not giving back its giving forward so many people have given to us its our turn to give forward to the next generation
9321751 its an obligation its something i have to do its a necessity in my life
9321752 but being that there is life after football and being that weve been playing this game that weve invested so much time and love in i think just naturally were going to tend to look for things in our lives that are going to not just be there just to be there but give us a purpose for doing what were doing
9321753 its easier for me to play with so much more emotion and let it pour out of me on a daily basis
9321754 for me personally i think the biggest thing from the trip was it was just kind of like a refresher to be thankful for what it is that i have in my life
9321755 the ability that ive been given and just everything its just sweeter now it makes it easier to get up in the morning

9321758 the cold war will end through acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism

9321762 there arent many left who care what happens to her id like her to know i care
9321763 there is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness and when you begin to build your life upon that rock with the cement of the faith in god that you have then you have a real start
9321764 give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skin we are willing to make a deal with your slave masters
9321765 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
9321766 the destiny of man is not measured by material computation when great forces are on the move in the world we learn we are spirits not animals
9321767 there is something going on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether we like it or not spells duty

9321778 due to the hurricane the president is unlikely to travel to minnesota on monday
9321779 we are working on alternate preparations and well provide details as soon as possible
9321780 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9321781 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9321782 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9321783 im on vacation i dont got nothing to lose i got one more month left you know go to the house relax and see what my situation is going to be
9321784 as far as how we pitch him were missing our location on him is what were doing right now
9321785 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9321786 the other side is the best team in the national league we play everybody hard
9321787 i struggled a little bit in first inning and didnt get into a good rhythm
9321788 i kind of found it and started pounding the zone with all my pitches
9321789 ive already did what i am going to do in my career
9321790 even though im not walking guys my command just isnt there
9321791 im throwing plenty of strikes but the strikes just arent as quality as theyve been in the past
9321792 our fans didnt deserve the kind of effort we put out thursday
9321793 were not only battling for fourth place were also battling to move up to third or second
9321794 we played with an aggressive tenacity we havent had in a long time
9321795 we have to go out and control our own destiny
9321796 i think that definitely the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not every thing has to be perfect all the time
9321797 thats helped me to if i dont have a perfect practice i dont get really upset about the whole tournament
9321798 i never want to see james lose he is definitely a close friend of mine
9321799 james is obviously an extremely tough out here it feels like hes got 20 000 friends screaming in my ear
9321800 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9321801 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving
9321802 it was tough but id like to think now that im wiser im ready to listen to my coach
9321803 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9321804 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends ryan howard connected for his major league leading 37th homer as the phils ended a three game skid in which they couldnt protect a lead
9321805 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9321806 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9321807 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9321808 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9321809 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9321810 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9321811 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9321812 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9321813 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9321814 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9321815 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9321816 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9321817 you know what ive actually had my eyes on it since my rookie year im always thinking about that
9321818 but its not a me thing not a spotlight thing i just figure if i can do something like that the teams going to benefit thats my only goal
9321819 to find a better set of corners in the league than what were playing with
9321820 basically for me i just try to attack the ball i dont try to relax my hands no heres the whole thing once im in the range of catching the ball i attack it
9321821 the receivers trying to do the same thing but i like to try to be more aggressive than he is attack the ball thats it
9321822 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9321823 its still early we still got a long way to go
9321824 but weve got a good group of guys here who can do it
9321825 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9321826 this gets the ball rolling in the right direction for us
9321827 thats as good a defensive team as weve ever played
9321828 we grew up tonight our defense carried us and we knew theyd have to carry us early in the season until our offense gets going were getting better
9321829 we needed to win this one to get some confidence especially for some of the guys who havent played much
9321830 these guys got a bad rap a few weeks ago for what happened but they dont deserve it
9321831 this one means a lot these guys have had a lot of adversity on them the past few weeks
9321832 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9321833 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9321834 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9321835 we can make an 8 1 game as exciting as anything in the world
9321836 we do probably have to find out what we can do to be a little more consistent than we have been
9321837 weve got to come out sunday and win too we cant lose that many more games and we know that
9321838 a walkoff anything ranks high because that means your team wins the game
9321839 you load the bases and hopefully you get a groundball and give your infielders a chance to go home and maybe turn two if its hit hard enough
9321840 you just have to keep working working working and eventually its going to turn around
9321841 i hit him with two strikes so i actually did him a favor
9321842 the best way to respond is with the bats and we did
9321843 no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9321844 i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it
9321845 i felt the same as i did the last time against them
9321846 you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times when you are good
9321847 the last couple of days i got on base every time so its just one of those things

9321874 manchester city fc can confirm that argentinian defender pablo zabaleta has signed for the club today from espanyol for an undisclosed fee
9321875 we feel the addition of pablo is another great signing for manchester city
9321876 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9321877 i am very happy to come here and play in the
9321878 people always tell you about games against celtic but i think you probably need to play in one to really live it
9321879 they are special fixtures for the supporters and i really hope i get the chance to take part and that my team mates and i do as well as possible
9321880 i have enjoyed my time in scotland so far and everything is going well both on and off the pitch
9321881 the lads in the squad have been fantastic and my family are here so i am happy with life as im playing well too
9321882 we will work hard and make sure we are ready for celtic i can only speak about how weve done since i joined rangers but i think we have done well
9321883 based on the last couple of performances i think the team is improving and we just need to keep looking to do that now im looking for three points against celtic
9321884 it was a good performance against falkirk and sets us up mentally for the rangers game
9321885 i played three times against rangers last season and the atmosphere at both
9321886 for me it is one of the best derbies in the world and im just really glad im part of this im very happy here and the teams confidence will be up ahead of the rangers game
9321887 this championship brings together lesbian and from across the world encourages more gay people to get involved in the sport and through the spending power of visiting teams and spectators benefits the london economy
9321888 it challenges the machismo and homophobia that is often associated with football in many parts of the world
9321889 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9321890 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9321891 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9321892 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9321893 i want to bring home to world leaders on this expedition the reality of what is now happening here in the arctic the rate of change is clearly faster than nearly all the models predict which has huge implications for and how to tackle it
9321894 we covered just under 13 6 miles saw lots of puffins along the way
9321895 the weather continues to be good to us although it is nearly september the sea is relatively calm and we made good progress
9321896 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of to the club
9321897 i think reading isaacs piece was the first time i had to look up words while reading a blog entry i am happy however that smith does have a more expanded vocabulary than myself while writing

9321901 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9321902 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9321903 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia
9321904 russia may pretend with its petro power and wealth to be immune from any actions by the west but beyond the short term it is vulnerable
9321905 im not too concerned about the numbers to be frank
9321906 it hurts when you lose you can chase the statistics all you like but the fact was it was a belting
9321907 if you lose a test by one or more than one you came second i dont go home and look at the scores in fact i am quite often not even conscious of the scoreboard
9321908 but you have a fair idea whether you get home or not thats the whole point
9321909 we had some possession early looked threatening didnt finish it might have helped the mindset ours and theirs if we had scored early but its done and dusted

9321914 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9321915 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9321916 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9321917 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9321918 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9321919 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9321920 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it

9321927 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change

9321948 that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed they also have an agreement that theyre not going to go out and talk about what theyre doing in each of the meetings
9321949 the solution should be comprehensive and as we have worked relentlessly throughout this peace process in order to achieve the aspirations of our people and their dream in having an independent palestinian state on the 1967 borders with its capital jerusalem within the framework of the palestinian fundamental principles
9321950 the importance of reaching complete comprehensive solutions not partial solutions and not postponing any of the main issues
9321951 there are still difficult issues to come to agreement on that there are still gaps

9321953 it will create difficulties for the visayas and mindanao which depend on ships for transport i hope that the bmi will review its findings

9321965 the park is not using ground water from the beginning it was made clear that the park would harvest rainwater to meet all its requirements the park has the largest rainwater harvesting facility in the country
9321966 the claim about rainwater harvesting is a ploy to fool people the park has to either depend on groundwater or the river in the area the park has ripped off the mask of environmental activism of the cpi m it is they who campaigned against the coca cola plant at plachimada in palakkad district on exploiting ground water
9321967 cpi m is now a corporate which owns a private limited company

9321983 if we are in any way held responsible for a schism
9321984 then so be it but i think the onus should be on those who choose to walk apart we have never asked those who disagree with us to leave the church
9321985 if there is some sort of schism or temporary separation then it will be a healthy reflection of reality and the truthfulness of what we have been saying will emerge without any reasonable doubt it would only show up in stark relief the reality of what we have been saying all along that the church is a place of much homophobia
9321986 life for gay priests is immeasurably worse than when i started doing this job because of the obsessive scrutiny of those who hate us many people have given up the fight and left the priesthood it is now official policy to ensure that gay people who dont give a commitment to celibacy are not selected for ordination
9321987 i admire richard for his trenchant criticism of his churchs ongoing homophobia
9321988 and his sterling leadership of the lesbian and gay christian movement but when interviewed on radio 4s sunday this morning he had to acknowledge that most gay anglican clergy remained as closeted as when lgcm was founded this is not a sign of great progress
9321989 en los ltimos 15 a os se triplic la tasa de encarcelamiento en la argentina

9321992 en 15 a os pas de tener una tasa de 74 reclusos a 211
9321993 esta situaci n est dada por el mejoramiento macro de la econom a
9321994 la inequidad en la distribuci n de la riqueza conlleva al crecimiento del delito
9321995 la difusi n de los hechos delictivos y su impacto en la opini n p blica influye en los operadores de la justicia penal
9321996 por eso la cantidad de presos aument exponencialmente produciendo un problema significativo a los penitenciarios con c rceles superpobladas hacinadas y un incremento l gico de violencia interna
9321997 priorizan la tecnolog a sobre el personal penitenciario son tres veces m s costosas que las c rceles estatales e impiden el desarrollo del sistema penitenciario en forma global
9321998 en costa rica ofrecieron construir una penitenciaria para 1 200 presos por 73 millones de d lares a un costo diario de de 37 d lares por cada detenido cuando en una c rcel estatal asciende a 9 d lares diarios en el mismo pa s
9321999 el castigo argument es la privaci n de la libertad ambulatoria y a ese derecho coartado no hay que agravarlo
9322000 si ampliamos las ofertas educacionales laborales y de relaci n familiar de los internos aumentan las posibilidades de que no reincidan en el delito una vez liberados
9322001 aunque a veces resulte dif cil por sus actitudes irrespetuosas ese es el momento de poner la otra mejilla ya que la experiencia demuestra que si quien ostenta el poder act a con dignidad recibir el mismo trato
9322002 clearly the price of gas reserves have gone up there is an energy shortage in the world and the players are totally different and its really a question of size does matter
9322003 i am immensely worried about the ultimate destiny of a lot of food manufacturers in this country
9322004 globally we are seeing the growth of the majors and unless we are able to build a food manufacturing business in australia that is sustainable then ultimately the global manufacturers will take the power base
9322005 my reading is that many of the smaller suppliers have been probably been squeezed out of the industry and that leads me to a concern over the next 10 or 15 years in that its a cycle that comes and goes who knows in 10 or 15 years time there may be a handful of global manufacturers that win back that power base and thats a frightening thought
9322006 well see job cuts continuing as businesses are under a lot of pressure the manufacturing sector is getting support from exports but being held back by weak domestic activity
9322007 if you look at the housing situation the debt situation and gas prices it adds up to something unfavourable
9322008 there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9322009 when it comes to being out of touch with what middle class americans are going through george bush and john mccain are two of a kind
9322010 we still have time to accomplish important goals for our country
9322011 the proposed rail development does not run through the byfield national park as stated by some sections
9322012 it runs through commonwealth defence land thats been purchased and used extensively for defence training and military manoeuvres since 1967
9322013 approximately 50 per cent of the proposed rail line route is already cleared buffer zone for the defence force
9322014 we acknowledge that there are environmental impacts which will need to be examined thoroughly by authorities and by the community
9322015 thats precisely why significant projects of this type undertake comprehensive environmental impact studies required under both state and federal legislation as part of their approval process
9322016 two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert
9322017 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
9322018 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9322019 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9322020 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9322021 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9322022 qrc and its members have lobbied strongly to ensure that the needs of communities in regions such as the bowen and surat basins and north west queensland are recognised and rewarded through tangible returns such as improved community services
9322023 it will be backed by a 100 million funding program over three years for economic and social infrastructure in regional and rural communities in key mining areas
9322024 projects may include new or upgraded roads schools and health facilities
9322025 if the situation continues we will slow down purchases of copper scrap and wait for more reasonable prices
9322026 at the same time we will have to cut our output due to a shortage in the raw materials
9322027 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
9322028 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that
9322029 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
9322030 this storm will prove to be a worst case scenario for the production region
9322031 the big question for the market is going to be how quickly after gustav passes will the industry be able to recover and get back online
9322032 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day
9322033 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band as yet
9322034 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9322035 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset writedowns continue
9322036 historically september is the worst month of the year for us shares and october is often the worst month of the year for australian shares
9322037 the main driver for the more modest gdp outcome for the quarter is likely to be weak household consumption
9322038 we are looking for quite a flat picture for consumption
9322039 we have higher interest rates and the credit crunch biting but the commodity boom has been supporting growth
9322040 export volumes have been surprisingly strong given the australian dollar and we have seen the volumes of imports soften in response to softening domestic demand
9322041 the equipment side of things that feeds the gdp number
9322042 that makes some discussion of a negative outcome for the gdp number no longer relevant

9322050 i know someone on shack or left4dead411 someone was like oh you can see they slowed it down on the 360 did it seem slower to you yeah we didnt slow it down at all for the 360 our tech guys our really smart guys did a ton of work so that the 360 users see the same things the pc users do everythings the same when we do split screen we do a couple little things just graphically there to smooth things out but its still the same speed same match same number of zombies so as we were working on it guys were like we have this big hammer we can make less zombies and were always like no we can not use that hammer we must fix it in other ways there is a little bit of auto aim that happens you can either do an auto aim by helping you to track a target or by helping you to shoot what you think youre aiming at we wanted you to shoot what you think youre aiming at a lot of times your friends are there you have friendly fire on but you just want to shoot we also do little cheats like if youre helping someone up you dont get hit by friendly fire if youre down and a hunters on top of you you dont get friendly fire we want friendly fire to add to the fun and not be this big negative so on normal difficulty it does barely any damage
9322051 you know i didnt actually say a flamethrower laughs i got a lot of shit for that there are a bunch of different ideas weve got any cool thing from a zombie movie zombie game there are a lot of cool things we want to do personally i like lighting everything on fire in development i actually had a key where i could just set anything i want on fire laughs youd do it too right there are some other ideas we had for versus mode that weve played around with there are some other modes with co op that we played around with as well that well start releasing afterward we see outside playtesters playing the scenarios for about an hour and a half to two hours so its about the length of a movie they kind of feel about right well maybe look at making some shorter experiences and some maybe even longer experiences
9322052 we talked it over with ea they have a lot of insight into when the optimal time for release is
9322053 no ps3 no ps3 no ps3 long pause maybe laughs
9322054 yes thats our plan for the tf2 maps when we release the big xbox 360 update its going to include everything
9322055 the biggest problem with the console version of tf2 is that we had kids with dial up connections saying i can host a 16 player server we had a little thing that said oh no you cant and theyre like oh yes i can and so then people would connect have a horrible experience and go this game sucks and so one of the things were doing is hosting dedicated servers its a program microsoft offers where theyll come in theyve got to certify our data center they work with us on it and they let us host the servers and that way were able to ramp it up and have a better experience for our users and of course you wont have to connect to a dedicated server you can do split screen you can play alone you can do system link you can do peer connection you can do all those things but if you go in the match menu and you hit quick match itll try to find you a dedicated server to play on weve already started doing some server hosting for tf2 well have dedicated servers on pc as well to a lesser extent probably just because theres so much there already
9322056 weve talked about that i personally prefer it i used to hate it in tf2 now i kind of like it sometimes depending on the mood im in but in this youre like hey douuuuggg hey douuuuugg im over here ahhhh there is a ton of trash talk it really is an evil game when you play it in versus mode but when people play co op you can hear them laughing down the hall co op its laughing and having a good time punctuated with profanity
9322057 i think well be starting that in october were still on our little if youre read the press release were still officially on our tour laughs so theres only so many of us that do the press vegas next week england after that and russia well see how that goes

9322066 i dont care if you approach something too seriously people can figure you out too easily and soon theyre not interested in you anymore at this point youre over the hill i prefer to be a constant creative nuisance
9322067 if i was in detroit ill see why i need to hurry up and have a hit record id see a pretty car going around on the street or a pretty girl going down the street or somebody who look like they got a lot of money all those things that look like a commercial all day long bites at you and you figure out why you have to have another hit record and consequently you cant even get it then cause youre worried about it too much
9322068 thats the thing why i probably like the farm so much i mean i am basically funky for real i could be just as happy in a hotel but then what would happen i would have nothing to fight for i was forced to earn money and to continue making music that is also why the record companies took me seriously again because i made them believe that losing the house would be the end of the world for me
9322069 the best way for people to know that you wanna make money is get a house and a car and fight for it all factories will give you a loan for a house and a car cause they know youre gonna be to work monday to pay for that
9322070 in the decision on chavez vs nha the supreme court wrote that it is unfortunate that after almost 20 years after the 1897 constitution was made there is no enabling law that provides mechanism for the compulsory disclosure of information
9322071 access to official records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts transactions or decisions as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development
9322072 subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law the state adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest
9322073 government authorities often look to sec 5 of ra 6713 as the way of addressing requests for information
9322074 sb 1578 states that requests on information should be complied with within five working days but could be extended to 15 days as opposed to hb 3732s 10 calendar days

9322079 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate
9322080 i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari
9322081 questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione
9322082 il male esiste e resiste in ogni generazione anche ai nostri giorni che cosa sono gli orrori della guerra le violenze sugli innocenti la miseria e lingiustizia che infieriscono sui deboli se non lopposizione del male al regno di dio e come rispondere a tanta malvagit se non con la forza disarmata e disarmante dellamore che vince lodio della vita che non teme la morte e la stessa misteriosa forza che us ges a costo di essere incompreso e abbandonato da molti dei suoi
9322083 come per cristo cos pure per i cristiani portare la croce non dunque facoltativo ma una missione da abbracciare per amore nel nostro mondo attuale dove sembrano dominare le forze che dividono e distruggono il cristo non cessa di proporre a tutti il suo chiaro invito chi vuol essere mio discepolo rinneghi il proprio egoismo e porti con me la croce

9322085 we are not going to be like animals or to be like the homosexuals god save us from that you understand we have to take the judgment the judgment is to kill them
9322086 he is muslim and he gets out of islam he doesnt want any more what are we going to do we kill him kill kill
9322087 we are not blind followers of any government or any clerics we criticise other religions just as other religions criticise islam we encourage integration into society
9322088 if pana christians are demanding st status simply because they speak the local kui language then there are people from general castes in the same areas who speak it too if speaking kui is the yardstick for according st status then it should be uniformly applied to all
9322089 the authorities were aware that there would be trouble after swami saraswatis killing yet they allowed the body to be brought in a procession from tumudibandha to chakapada a distance of over 200 km the sight of the body incited passions and led to attacks on churches and christian homes
9322090 since habitations are scattered and most roads run through jungles they can be blocked by cutting just one tree the attacks both in 2007 and now were possible only because the roads were blocked with felled trees
9322091 even though forces were mobilised in time they could not get to the riot spots in time
9322092 the ccsc is particularly concerned that the secretary of states bare below the elbows policy is not supported by demonstrable scientific evidence and was issued hastily in response to an intense period of media focus on the issue
9322093 prevent the policy from being universally applied so other muslim women do not experience the same trauma
9322094 she is not an employee of the trust and therefore we have not and could not have dismissed her
9322095 the trusts chaplain and imam both stand behind our bare below the elbows policy and support the trust in this instance they do not cite any diversity issue and agree that the policy is an acceptable professional requirement for everyone who works for the trust in clinical areas
9322096 to protect our patients and minimise the risk of infection to them
9322097 enjoy an uncritical acceptance which would never be accorded religious faith

9322111 sicher hat auch georgien gro e fehler begangen vor allem solche die unmittelbar zum ausbruch des krieges f hrten auf dem gipfel wird es aber darum gehen wie es nach ende der kampfhandlungen weitergeht da hat die eu st rker mit russland zu reden
9322112 die kontrollposten auf georgischem gebiet etwa sind nicht zu rechtfertigen und dienen dem ziel einer destabilisierung georgiens

9322127 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9322128 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

9322135 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9322136 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9322137 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9322138 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9322139 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9322140 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9322141 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9322142 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9322143 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9322144 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9322145 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9322146 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9322147 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9322148 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9322149 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9322150 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9322151 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9322152 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9322153 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9322154 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9322155 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9322156 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9322157 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9322158 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9322159 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9322160 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9322161 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9322162 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9322163 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9322164 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9322165 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9322166 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9322167 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9322168 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9322169 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9322170 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9322171 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9322172 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9322173 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9322174 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9322175 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9322176 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9322177 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9322178 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9322179 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9322180 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9322181 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9322182 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9322183 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9322184 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9322185 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9322186 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9322187 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9322188 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9322189 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9322190 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9322191 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9322192 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9322193 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9322194 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9322195 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9322196 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9322197 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9322198 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9322199 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

9322249 our offensive line really came together after that first quarter and i cant say enough about the job that tony washington royland tubbs sam collins joseph thompson and trevis turner did tonight sam and joseph are the leaders of that group and they did a great job of encouraging those new guys and working with them and not getting down on them thats what great leaders do and thats what they did for us tonight
9322250 im so proud of our guys for the way they kept battling and the way they believed throughout the entire game

9322312 i am very happy to come here and play in the
9322313 people always tell you about games against celtic but i think you probably need to play in one to really live it
9322314 they are special fixtures for the supporters and i really hope i get the chance to take part and that my team mates and i do as well as possible
9322315 i have enjoyed my time in scotland so far and everything is going well both on and off the pitch
9322316 the lads in the squad have been fantastic and my family are here so i am happy with life as im playing well too
9322317 we will work hard and make sure we are ready for celtic i can only speak about how weve done since i joined rangers but i think we have done well
9322318 based on the last couple of performances i think the team is improving and we just need to keep looking to do that now im looking for three points against celtic
9322319 it was a good performance against falkirk and sets us up mentally for the rangers game
9322320 i played three times against rangers last season and the atmosphere at both celtic park and ibrox is fantastic
9322321 for me it is one of the best derbies in the world and im just really glad im part of this
9322322 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9322323 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation
9322324 i think her inexperience is going to cause many many voters to think twice before voting for him
9322325 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9322326 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9322327 i wouldve thought that mccain would go for someone more experienced someone who had been in and out of the country it was a shock
9322328 i wouldnt say that there are any disagreements on anything other than policy

9322336 two teenagers who had been given city permission to write their messages protesting democratic presidential nominee sen
9322337 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
9322338 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
9322339 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
9322340 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
9322341 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here

9322354 the atmosphere of fierce competition has affected everyone at the site we all feel like playing some volleyball to get involved
9322355 more people developed the habit of doing some outdoor exercise in the morning or in the evening
9322356 young people were jogging and the elderly would form into groups practicing dances with traditional chinese style swords and fans

9322362 im having more fun now i think than i did when i working
9322363 there are a lot of people who only have social security and its hard for them i think the government should be taking care of them as opposed to taking care of the people who dont want to work
9322364 its gotten to the point where we just need more resources in the community and more alternatives
9322365 its a certainty that there will be an increase in the percentage of the elderly population
9322366 people are living a lot longer and its leading to a lot of other issues and needs
9322367 our older citizens an awful lot of them dont have access to the kind of transportation they need
9322368 there are throughout the county who are trying to figure out how to get to their dialysis appointments there are people who are trying to figure out how to buy their groceries
9322369 its going to make it increasingly difficult over say the next 10 years or so for people who have elderly parents to find the kind of placement they are looking for
9322370 they are a generation that didnt believe in sitting around and wasting time
9322371 theyve contributed all their lives and they still want to contribute
9322372 we grew and we grew and we grew but we didnt change anything fundamentally about what we do
9322373 were not looking for someone to tell us what to do we want someone to facilitate the process rather than coming in and giving us a cookie cutter approach thats been used at other places
9322374 he has indicated that the health sciences center is very important to him
9322375 he feels that we need to find better ways to make joint decisions
9322376 i can guarantee you that we wont be slow in the future
9322377 were not done getting the people here is one thing the next thing is making sure we have the right programs
9322378 there wont be a new dean until theres a new vice president
9322379 which is what convinced me not to be a republican right now
9322380 this used to be just beach road that was everything to this community
9322381 people are a little worn out over the party label and they just want to see things done
9322382 national defense is a big item i dont care if youre republican or democrat
9322383 i think weve got to win in hampton roads and weve got to win well
9322384 even more than john kerry vs george bush there is a distinct difference between these two guys one is much more liberal from a veterans view it should be a no brainer but we cant rest on our laurels we have to get this vote out
9322385 thats in the form of contracts for all types of things
9322386 virginia has benefited from the years of work that mccain has done on the budget side not much has been said certainly in virginia of his contributions toward virginias economy

9322410 due to the hurricane the president is unlikely to travel to minnesota on monday
9322411 we are working on alternate preparations and well provide details as soon as possible
9322412 the timing is bad because it clearly is going to be a distraction from the convention and it may for some people bring back memories of the bush administration and its response to hurricane katrina
9322413 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9322414 this was a tremendous coordinated effort and achievement by the raider brigade soldiers
9322415 then there are two soldiers who keep the rear of the aerostat steady they are called the snubber line operators
9322416 when the aerostat is safely airborne in accordance with all pre post flight procedures the soldiers take up positions in the ground base system to operate the camera and watch the actions of the aerostat
9322417 it is definitely different and challenging one that i will never forget
9322418 the aerostat is an excellent tool for my professional progression
9322419 i was scared being a flight director because i was the lowest ranking soldier making crucial decisions
9322420 we are often so caught up in our destination that we forget to appreciate the journey especially the goodness of the people we meet along the way appreciation is a wonderful feeling dont overlook it

9322450 eine menge leute werden versuchen auf alle m glichen strategien zu setzen um ihre positionen zu verbessern viele der jungs und m dels die acht bis zehn pl tze zur ckliegen werden ein paar verr ckte dinge versuchen wir werden uns aufs rennen konzentrieren und wollen nat rlich gewinnen
9322451 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here
9322452 rob der start war wohl der entscheidende moment des rennens w rdest du dem zustimmen
9322453 ja nat rlich man muss einfach bedenken dass es in oschersleben besonders schwierig ist denn die erste kurve ist sehr eng um ehrlich zu sein denke ich aber dass der start nicht ganz fair verlaufen ist gabriele gabriele tarquini anm d red lag schon vor der letzten kurve vor mir und blicherweise ist es nun einmal der pole sitter der die pace kontrollieren sollte
9322454 er h tte eigentlich bis zum ampelsignal hinter mir bleiben m ssen so war es aber nicht aber egal ich hatte im prinzip eine gute linie habe den bremspunkt gut erwischt nicola nicola larini anm d red hat sich mit einigen anderen wagen angelegt und auch ich habe in kurve eins einen schlag von hinten bekommen woraufhin ich meinerseits gabriele etwas nach au en gedr ckt habe
9322455 nach ein paar kurven hatten wir uns dann sortiert aber da war augusto schon vorne als ich gabriele berholt hatte gab es nichts mehr f r mich zu tun es war schlicht unm glich augusto noch einzufangen er war echt stark und die bmws scheinen hier berhaupt sehr schnell zu sein wir haben zwar den sieg verpasst aber dennoch zwei wagen auf das podium gebracht
9322456 du hast gestern schon gesagt dass du den titelkampf in der meisterschaft aufgegeben hast nun haben die f hrenden nicht gepunktet und du hast aufgeholt wie siehst du das jetzt

9322459 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our comin atcha live 2008 dvd while we were on the road coming home in march we hired terry to jump back into writing and recording music with us while we edited the dvd and routed a summer tour of europe were riding a wave of energy that doesnt come easy for a band of rookies much less a band whose been doing this for over 20 years and we wouldnt have it any other way
9322460 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
9322461 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest
9322462 if people just took the time to look at the trees outside the rain thats falling these bodies that are walking around life is not just evidence that god exists but more like the world acting as worship leader inspiring us but much louder than any concert you could ever imagine
9322463 ultimately i hope that by listening to these songs people will find the same inspiration to look outside of themselves and their circumstance to the world around them and truly worship god
9322464 i think this last year and a half on the road has taught me a lot about who i want to be as an artist and more than anything i really thought about the live show there were moments touring where i would say to myself i wish i had this kind of song to play right now so with cannons i set out to work all of that experience into the record

9322564 coming into the game we wanted to take a shot early coming off the punt we knew we wanted to take it right then
9322565 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her

9322579 stanley played well they both have pass rush abilities hilee is probably a little bit more raw but he had a good preseason so we made the decision
9322580 terrence came in and played extremely well for us and really brought a lot of intangibles into our locker room
9322581 obviously we were sorting through the roster cuts this morning and the timing wasnt very good thats for sure
9322582 it became more and more evident each week that was a decision that made sense
9322583 dani played really well but it was also great team effort overall

9322587 it would take us a whole half to cross the 50 yard line
9322588 you saw in the past with your own eyes what his offense could do
9322589 weve got a new leader on the ship when he stands up in the room you know he knows what hes talking about everythings going to change this year
9322590 no matter what you have done in this league he makes you feel like you still have to prove yourself
9322591 if i mess up hes going to get on me thats what i like about him he treats everybody the same
9322592 hes what we thought hed be and more he doesnt make mental errors hes the kind of player to build an offense around
9322593 they can both catch the ball and theyre outstanding runners but theyre just different frank is a more physical and powerful back inside and marshall is very elusive

9322616 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9322617 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9322618 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9322619 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9322620 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9322621 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9322622 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9322623 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9322624 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9322625 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9322626 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9322627 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9322628 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9322629 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9322630 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9322631 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9322632 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9322633 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9322634 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9322635 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9322636 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9322637 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9322638 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9322639 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9322640 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9322641 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9322642 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9322643 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9322644 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9322645 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9322646 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9322647 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9322648 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9322649 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9322650 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9322651 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9322652 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9322653 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9322654 no one works for someone we all just work together
9322655 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9322656 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9322657 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9322658 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9322659 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9322660 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9322661 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9322662 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9322663 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9322664 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9322665 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9322666 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9322667 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9322668 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9322669 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9322670 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9322671 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9322672 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9322673 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9322674 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9322675 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9322676 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9322677 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9322678 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9322679 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9322680 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9322681 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9322682 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9322683 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9322684 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9322685 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9322686 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9322687 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9322688 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9322689 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9322690 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9322691 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9322692 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9322693 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9322694 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9322695 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9322696 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9322697 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9322698 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9322699 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9322700 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9322701 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9322702 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9322703 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9322704 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9322705 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9322706 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9322707 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point

9322709 derrotamos un rival muy dif cil que en el primer tiempo nos complic pero m s por exceso de confianza nuestra me gust el funcionamiento del equipo en la segunda parte y creo que fuimos justos ganadores
9322710 me siento fel z por la racha goleadora en la que estoy pero estoy m s contento porque millonarios sigue arriba y eso es lo que pretendemos no se cu ndo pueda detenerse la racha de goles pero trabajar para que contin e siempre jugar en la selecci n colombia es algo que quiero y estoy preparado para ello
9322711 fuimos justos perdedores en bogot cometimos errores en los que vamos a tener que trabajar fuerte para no volver a cometerlos no hay justificaci n el resultado fue contuindente yo quiero un equipo vertical y ese ser el primer objetivo a cumplir
9322712 verkl rt die vergangenheit verdr ngt dann oft die negative seite
9322713 positives wie vollbesch ftigung soziale sicherheit nachbarschaftshilfe r cken in den vordergrund negatives wird verdr ngt
9322714 ein erfolg auch f r die erwerbslosen initiativen die von anfang an kritisch berichteten
9322715 suddenly this hairy old man appeared wearing pyjamas and yelling at george to turn the music down because it was keeping him awake
9322716 ive been trying to get stuck into georges back catalogue for years and just when im about to get hold of a couple of rare items some old git jerks him off
9322717 it was touch and go they were trying to get him down for 12 hours without success but they all put their weight together and eventually managed to pull him to safety
9322718 ive never regretted anything ive done in my life we all knew that hanging from a bungee above manchester might be dangerous but the last thing i expected was to be pulled off by 40 000 firemen
9322719 looks like they were sucked up in a typhoon like tracker device onto the craft before being dumped on the governors doorstep
9322720 its like sodom and gomorrah over there and it sucks
9322721 if it hits as a category 5 were expecting a tremendous amount of damage
9322722 the provider failed to take action after she was notified of a finding of abuse for a caregiver who provided direct care to residents
9322723 its an eye opener and you pray that it doesnt happen in your own fire department
9322724 this is not a pleasant thing to talk about you know firefighters setting fires
9322725 we needed something that would teach them what to look for and how to deal with it and how to prevent it
9322726 its a complex problem and fire departments should make it clear to members that there is zero tolerance and it wont be condoned every case that a department finds out about should be reported
9322727 it makes you think twice its unbelievable and a black eye to a fire department
9322728 were trying to make a difference here we hope by seeing this program fire services will take action to report it because it doesnt go away its only going to escalate
9322729 this is what we work for this is what we train for
9322730 this is such an outrageous power money grab by the county that all good people are incensed
9322731 none of the cities impacted are going to take this lying down
9322732 this will go into litigation immediately and be in litigation for years
9322733 it also reflects an apparent predetermined outcome by a majority of the commission in violation of the sunshine act
9322734 when the residents cross over the macarthur causeway and see two boats from two different districts theyre saying these people are wasting money
9322735 thats kind of the straw the broke the camels back
9322736 those cities should determine for themselves what fire department they want to have
9322737 next its police and then it will be garbage and then planning and zoning and code enforcement its very scary
9322738 these municipalities should have the right to determine this for themselves
9322739 we got a call earlier this week from the texas taskforce which is one of the groups that make up the federal emergency management agency
9322740 we signed a memorandum of understanding with them in 2006 and agreed to mobilise a team wherever they are deployed
9322741 gustav is a category 3 hurricane and has the potential to have winds of between 105 135mph plus a storm surge
9322742 it started in the caribbean and is expected to hit land again as a hurricane late tomorrow it appears to be heading towards new orleans
9322743 this was a stupid pick by mccain palin is not hillary clinton
9322744 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9322745 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention
9322746 im not sure i will have my staff get back to you on that
9322747 oh crap i might only have 25 more summers left
9322748 we be meetin tsahsinksita long pause danrmeirka pause again yuh mmmk

9322757 va e donani uno aciaskuna delle xsona a kui tieni
9322758 the first year the turnout was pretty poor most people were still reeling from the collapse they didnt really get it
9322759 but now theyve had a chance to recover and see the real opportunities this so called disaster offers for improving our lives and the health of the planet people are remembering millennia old and frankly better ways to live theyre no longer wanting to go back to civilization
9322760 i dont see why you cant look good after the apocalypse
9322761 its made from salvaged curtains and sewn on an antique pedal machine
9322762 i had it delivered from new york by the pony x press bike messengers in only three weeks its amazing the alternative systems that have sprung up in the last three years since the crash
9322763 yes combat boots and camouflage grenades and aks all have their place but i see that more as everyday wear for slinking through the woods and protection on the streets this is a celebration and i wanted to throw caution to the wind and dress things up also we had a lot of security at the door so i felt i could leave my machete at home for once
9322764 i know its like the trendy thing to do right now or whatever but no one should have to go around dressed in rags
9322765 its funny how the remnants of civilization have become mockeries of themselves
9322766 we definitely did not expect this kind of turn out and we are happy to see that the people have come together in such a big way to support givelife charity i would love to make two requests to people please continue to support givelife with same kind of enthusiasm and reach out to the children who really need the support thats the only way to change the nation
9322767 i was always waiting for something like this to happen in chennai and show others that chennai is rocking and we all care for chennai i still cannot believe that this is happening in chennai and this is superb
9322768 this marathon is to tell the people that we want to educate chennai right from the beginning and that is why we are here even if you are not running and say that you are here to support the cause suggests that you are supporting the cause
9322769 those bangladeshis who are already staying in india should be provided citizenship further infiltration should be checked there should be strict vigil on the border
9322770 the party feels that in view of their social and economic conditions the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe people should get reservation in private sector every community or group should have equal representation in all sectors
9322771 believe it or not i used to be cripplingly shy
9322772 my grandfather was a preacher i came from a very religious strict upbringing in hawaii and i wasnt very popular guys just wouldnt go out with me
9322773 impress your friends at your next dinner party by showing them how wild you are and save the environment at the same time
9322774 and unlike you shane they understand that they dont have to be perfect to start their rewilding journey march 4 2008 at 11 08 am
9322775 the white powder found on the outside of the tree contains a good quantity of naturally occurring yeast
9322776 the parents are all the way on the other side of the pond they arent even sitting on them theyll get cold and die anyway
9322777 would that have happened were it not for the culture of civilization
9322778 honey i have something to tell you ive got snails
9322779 we prepare and shop for at least eight ten days in advance and later arrange according to the requirement we also try and do good things to our neighbours and relatives in the month
9322780 we start preparing three months ahead our preparations are almost complete and the remaining would be done today we wait the entire year for this month work load is so much that we work for nearly 18 hours a day and sleep in the rest we enjoy doing it
9322781 i really liked this whole concept its really nice and novel idea things like this happen in western countries but in india i think its first of its kind i have a labrador but its at my home it this event is organised next year i am definitely going to participate in this show
9322782 we are extremely happy that today dogs got married my dog is a lhasa aphso and today i have got another lhasa aphso for her it seems they both are completely in love in fact it was a love at first sight for both of them
9322783 players were complaining of feeling light headed and nauseous after training theyd been together four days and couldnt believe how little theyd eaten most are used to diets packed with carbohydrates to keep going now all theyre allowed is a bit of cereal and toast
9322784 it got so bad that some started smuggling supplies of chocolate and crisps into their rooms behind capellos back
9322785 one senior player started suffering stomach cramps and was sick all over the dressing room floor this isnt about the players being greedy but suddenly they were going long periods with nothing to eat and their systems couldnt cope
9322786 theres been a bit of moaning about the diet behind closed doors but no ones been brave enough to confront the boss head on
9322787 not everyone in patrol cars is trained to do high speed driving at the moment
9322788 they are either going to have to pay to train up everyone who might use a police vehicle or accept these speeding tickets and penalty points it will pose all kind of problems not least the admin required to identify who was behind the wheel and what level they were trained to
9322789 this is a huge issue forces have a major amount of work getting through the requirements of training officers
9322790 what this does is set national standards that should be consistent across england and wales and that holds chief constables to account which is a good thing
9322791 i like it when a guy gets the bar staff to bring a pint over and they say its from him over there and then he just leaves
9322792 i like the dark brooding thing that johnny depps got going on
9322793 thank you for showing me that can we move on
9322794 oh that makes total sense because when i asked how much i should take i got the answer in small but large doses
9322795 moving to the country gonna eat a lot of christmas trees
9322796 so i guess that leaves bugs on their menu me i aint prepared to sink that low
9322797 me or devin or plains or whoever the fuck you are you all sound the same so im guessing youre all the same person
9322798 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods
9322799 but their numbers are in lakhs hundreds of thousands and we require more resources more boats army and rescue efforts to evacuate them
9322800 i presented my buffalo to the boatman in exchange for a place in his boat since i dont have any money
9322801 ang nararamdaman ko ay sama ng loob tinutulungan na nga sila di ko akalain maging biktima din ako ng ambush lagi ko nang sinasabi ang giyera ay hindi solusyon
9322802 llahat ginagawa namin para sa kanila lahat binibigay kung humingi sila ng gamot o kung may problema sila pero hindi naman lahat kalaban dapat lang di nila ginawa yun

9322807 and today she ran every step of that 14km no walking and crossed the finish line 5 minutes ahead of her goal time
9322808 america is to blame for the troubles of the arab world not us
9322809 lebanese journalism in lebanon comes close to nothing but biased to a certain political party or entity journalism in lebanon has lost its meaning it has lost all of its integrity and objectivity in my eyes and has turned into nothing but a tool of one of the most fiercest propaganda wars that lebanon has faced in a long time maybe since its independence but the metaphysical nature has an interesting twist to it in lebanon as a journalist if you somewhat come close to the truth you are actually set free from your physical nature to put it more bluntly you are killed
9322810 the mission concluded that many publications and radio and television stations are close to political and religious groups and are at times promoting specific political agendas as media outlets asserted their positions on controversial issues journalists were increasingly being seen not as independent observers but as representatives of political movements open to attack from opposing factions this politicization has affected every aspect of the lebanese media and it has become increasingly difficult for journalists to express an opinion without being accused of serving one political faction or another pressure from readers had intensified as had editorial interference by political representatives the level of self censorship has increased throughout the media journalists who previously have been outspoken critics of political and social developments now question how safe they are when taking a controversial stand on such issues
9322811 every lebanese tv channel has a propaganda leaning some try to be balanced but all have their agendas its pretty clear from the content they produce
9322812 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9322813 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9322814 serious concern for future economic development and sustained rural livelihoods
9322815 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9322816 kakum is one of the last vestiges of the upper guinea forest and one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world
9322817 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable
9322818 the general security controlled things in lebanon the way the stasi did in the ddr at the top of the pyramid were syrian agents
9322819 gt freemedia piece details some of the events in 2006 even before the israel hezbollah war in lebanon
9322820 he was in what we call the changeover area there were a lot of horses there and another horse double barrelled him
9322821 he had a blood transfusion to stop the bleeding he has stabilised but is still not out of the woods
9322822 the timing is bad because it clearly is going to be a distraction from the convention and it may for some people bring back memories of the bush administration and its response to hurricane katrina
9322823 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9322824 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9322825 josh has applied to get his metropolitan licence back and were just waiting on the result now
9322826 i got to the front on him too soon and with all the signage around doomben he wanted to stargaze
9322827 it was a good win and youll see a lot more of him from now on
9322828 i thought he was good chance in the ramornie but unfortunately he got under the gates and was scratched
9322829 i have had him a 1000 metre barrier trial since then and he beat a fair horse called fleet baron
9322830 he ran a better time for the last 600 metres in the trial than the jackal clocked in winning the ramornie
9322831 i was going to run him in a couple of weeks in the ballina cup but after this win ill probably bring him back to brisbane
9322832 the manikato is a group one and he deserves another one
9322833 miss andretti hit the wall and she would have been the main threat
9322834 i think if he is to get a big race over 1200 metres it could be the manikato
9322835 it is very satisfying because i know how good the second horse is
9322836 that would give him two weeks to the 1800 metre race the underwood stakes
9322837 hes got to butter up either at his next run or the run after so i think i might run him next week which would give him two weeks into the underwood
9322838 we want to take one at a time and the caulfield cup comes first a week before the cox plate and thats our main goal at the moment
9322839 hes pulled up terrific he ate up well last night and had ten minutes on the treadmill this morning
9322840 this is where i started out and its great to be back
9322841 im still in the temporary stables at the moment but once the renovations are finished im hoping to build my team up to 40
9322842 i sympathise with the randwick trainers but im glad to be out here the facilities are amazing
9322843 my wife kylie is pregnant so well have three under three but thats the end of the section on that front
9322844 and well be moving as soon as i find a place so the pressures on
9322845 ill give her a couple of months off were just giving her a break so spring is over for her
9322846 hes a very nice horse and as long as he pulls up well thats ming dynasty where were heading with him
9322847 theres plenty of options for him but well see how he handles this next race first
9322848 i think when the tracks get better she will get a bit better she is not hopeless in the ground though
9322849 i like to think to think that if we can get her to the makybe diva and we get a reasonable track she will run pretty good
9322850 i asked greg childs to give her a solid out because she needs it
9322851 the caulfield cup is what were hoping for and if we can win that i dare say the other one will follow
9322852 she was lovely and settled and is pretty super well go straight to the kelt
9322853 he jumped he raced a little bit fresh which probably helped him get through the ground
9322854 he really travelled like a winner once he came off the bridle he floundered in the ground a bit but his class got him through it
9322855 he had a bit of class on the others but they were all rock hard fit
9322856 that was my only concern before the race but you cant beat class
9322857 if we can keep him fresh and relaxed he will win a good race this horse
9322858 he trialled nicely without the blinkers and did what i wanted
9322859 hes a very clean winded horse and the 1200 metres of the trial is just what i wanted ahead of the chelmsford
9322860 he wanted to lay in again but straightened up right away and glen boss was happy
9322861 its still too far out to make a decision on the epsom
9322862 thanks hibby i didnt have to really hurt him mate and youve got a good ride coming up in the next two
9322863 you think you can do it but youve got to do it dont you i know he can sprint and he proved today that hes a pretty smart horse brian hibberd did a great job down south and rode him at otaki but thats the luck of the draw brian will be back
9322864 uh wow have you ever been in a car accident
9322865 oh well you cant expect to feel better in two weeks you have to take it more than once

9322870 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9322871 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9322872 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9322873 fiddling around with the pan my first love was always the pan and i am grateful to be recognised for doing something which never felt like work to me
9322874 at last im being considered and honoured for all the work ive done over the years
9322875 pan trinbago wants to create awareness for the recognition and appreciation of the achievements of those like anthony williams
9322876 this is an extremely welcome development it could not have happened to a nicer and greater man it is a thoroughly well deserved award for his many years in the vineyard so thank you very much from all of us
9322877 the greatest all round panman in terms of developing the instrument arranging the music and leading a band
9322878 we have come together to not only celebrate the achievements of anthony williams but to mark his work by placing him in a position of cultural eminence
9322879 i hope my receiving the award would serve to inspire my colleagues to maintain the highest possible standard in order to achieve an attainment of this sort
9322880 we must also ensure that we behave in a professional manner in the future
9322881 take an interest in an area that you feel comfortable reporting on by specialising we can ensure that we become as knowledgeable as the trained professionals in their own field and even elevate yourself to professional status
9322882 its fantastic really good to know you are appreciated at this level a gold on any occasion is never taken for granted and its a great honour although i never expected it
9322883 i am proud to have been considered but im not thinking too much about it
9322884 as a matter of fact a group of us had nominated someone else from tobago so it came as a real surprise when i heard my name was on the list
9322885 you just have to go about doing what you need to do in your lives whether or not you receive a formal thank you
9322886 we needed that extra boost and now three innocent lives are lost they could have been living now
9322887 to a considerable extent we are being shown by the young people of our nation that we continue to be capable of excellent performance
9322888 in spite of the setbacks that are taking centre stage and which cause us to think otherwise there are a number of things that can be celebrated
9322889 one who immediately comes to mind it is the young child less than ten years old who by her bravery displayed in the forests of moruga prevented the kidnapping of an older cousin
9322890 our education system must take into account all the variables not least the sociology of our diverse and complex communities if we are to develop our human resources to the maximum of its potential
9322891 its a tremendous show of appreciation by the tt government all i was told was that richard was in line for an award but it was never really confirmed
9322892 we are not the type of people who will fuss over anything they did not have to do or give him anything and we really appreciate the fact that government has decided to show their appreciation in this way
9322893 we are certain that one of the bodies is that of jill foster and the other is believed to be that of a man

9322895 our new nation must maintain and develop its political system and its democratic machinery it must provide the cabinet ministers the members of parliament the civil servants the doctors the lawyers the engineers the ambassadors the nurses the teachers the skilled workers and the writers and artists which every independent nation has and provides for itself
9322896 you carry the future of trinidad and tobago in your schoolbags
9322897 and whereas trinidad and tobago will occupy in such an eastern caribbean federation a position in which it represents 55 percent of the population 75 percent of the import trade 75 percent of the total revenue 80 percent of income tax revenue 65 percent of revenue from import duties 73 percent of total expenditure be it therefore resolved that tt reject unequivocally any participation in the proposed federation of the eastern caribbean
9322898 a governments duty in such matters is to elicit comments and observations the way to do that is to give people something to comment or make observations about
9322899 williams ignored all political forces outside the pnm he never attempted to establish a bipartisan approach to the federation issue and he plunged the country into a divisive political conflict on the very eve of independence
9322900 probably recognising that trinidad was sitting on the brink of racial war and responding to pressure from an impatient colonial secretary anxious to finish the whole business williams agreed to compromise
9322901 a number of critically important clauses were specially entrenched requiring a three quarter majority in the house and a two thirds majority in the senate for amendment williams agreed to independent elections and boundaries commissions and he pledged to consult with the leader of the opposition on all important national issues and all appointments of national character
9322902 parliamentary opposition after having been decisively defeated by the time of independence in 1962 collapsed through splits and non participation meanwhile there had developed a vigorous and popular extra parliamentary opposition to the williams government this movement centred in the trade union movement and at the university of the west indies appealed to anti imperialist youth socialist cultural nationalist particularly pro african and other anti establishment sentiments current at the time

9322920 the situation has not changed at all the negotiations are continuing and i still wish to leave madrid i want to play for chelsea
9322921 the president and pedja mijatovic said they will let me leave but schuster doesnt because he has promised to make me feel comfortable again if he thinks that its his problem i dont want to stay at real madrid
9322922 calderon said that if a good offer came in they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort to sign me

9322928 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment

9322937 aka the card check forced unionism bill looms over the horizon threatening to unleash a wave of coercive union organizing across america
9322938 the fuel the opening for the seiu to change our growth curve from 100 000 to a million or more workers a year
9322939 on labor day as we celebrate the free enterprise system and the value of hard work union officials are mounting an unprecedented billion dollar campaign effort to grab more forced unionism power
9322940 their goal is to elect a president and a filibuster proof senate that will give them even more tools to force workers to join or pay dues to a union
9322941 doesnt mean things have to always be done exactly the same
9322942 which would block employees from secret ballot elections over unionization passage of efca more accurately called the card check forced unionism bill is central to big labors plans to obtain new coercive union organizing privileges
9322943 there is that huge split because there is a huge split in what obama and mccain represent
9322944 if we gave money to mccain that wouldnt change the positions hes had for many years
9322945 it would be like the chickens getting together and giving a donation to colonel sanders
9322946 he was the most energetic and aggressive on trade policy
9322947 we will keep the heat on so things get done
9322948 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
9322949 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
9322950 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
9322951 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
9322952 our serious concerns about these charges have been greatly elevated by the recently published article
9322953 we have grave concerns that this type of betrayal of public trust and malfeasance may be happening in our local union
9322954 they are just unhappy with him because he is in charge
9322955 pure loyalty to alejandro stephens whether hes wrong or right
9322956 four more years of the same old politics and the same old policies
9322957 schemes involving bribery extortion deprivation of union rights by violence and embezzlement used by early racketeers are still employed to abuse the power of unions
9322958 it would be difficult to imagine a more unreliable method of ascertaining the real wishes of employees
9322959 i called on monday requesting a statement from the aclu about accountable americas intimidation campaign against gop donors what is the aclus position with regard to such efforts waiting for your statement
9322960 michelle my apologies that i cannot be of more assistance but we dont have anyone available thanks pam
9322961 pam does this mean you dont have anyone available today this week or for the foreseeable future
9322962 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
9322963 it all started innocently enough i was at a party and someone was passing around a a puppy and im thinking just one puppy what harm could it do well now ive got a five puppy a day habit man

9322966 technology is playing an important role in this convention moreso than ever before
9322967 first of all the delaware delegation was moved from the back of the floor to the front when joe biden was tapped as obamas running mate its a great view
9322968 what made me get into blogging was wanting to have a voice in politics

9322974 tools and insights on professional development quality of life and career issues that impact every lawyers success and satisfaction
9322975 all that the governments have been doing both in the state and at the centre is paint an illusion beautiful but hollow words is all they have to offer its been eight days and the violence continues if such a situation persists we will have no option but to form our own suraksha vahini
9322976 we met the prime minister the home minister and will meet the president tomorrow however i have my doubts that anything fruitful will come out of it all that we keep getting are fine words that this will be done and that will be done in reality not only kandhamal but many districts in orissa are burning
9322977 i have told people from orissa to say they are not christians in order to save their lives you can follow religion as long as you are alive this sadly is increasingly becoming an intolerant society
9322978 look theres mrs smith thats a new coat shes wearing dead fashionable i wonder where she got it
9322979 arent those yellow roses beautiful i wonder if i could cadge a few when i do the church decorations next weekend

9322982 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
9322983 the pick of ms palin brought raves from anti abortion groups but democratic nominee barack obamas campaign immediately questioned her resume
9322984 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9322985 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
9322986 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
9322987 tricia bowcher of maineville about an hour from dayton attended the rally at the ervin j nutter center on the campus of wright state university if mr mccain were intent on picking a woman she said she would have preferred ms hutchinson
9322988 to be honest i would have preferred mitt romney over everyone really because hes conservative and just embodies the republican base
9322989 is making a calculated gamble that she will be as much help as hindrance

9322994 with a degree of patience the united states can build on a pattern of positive change in iraq that offers it a chance to draw down troops soon without giving up hope for sustained stability
9322995 most americans have a mental image of iraq that is defined by the chaos of 2006
9322996 but iraq today is a very different place than it was two years ago
9322997 sunni insurgents overwhelmingly switched sides over the course of 2007 signing on to cease fires with the iraqi state mostly through the sons of iraq program which now includes over 100 000 participants who provide local security in exchange for legitimacy and financial support
9322998 the shiite militias especially muqtada mahdi army also know as jaish al mahdi or jam have seen their position undermined by a combination of sunni realignment u s and iraqi military pressure the increasing independence of splinter and rogue groups and a backlash against their own parasitic exploitation of the civilians they were ostensibly defending
9322999 the most violent actors iraqs extreme chauvinist sunni groups and aqi have been driven from most of western and central iraq and are losing their remaining urban havens in the provinces of diyala nineveh and salah ad din thanks to a series of offensives by u s and iraqi forces
9323000 but today there is a real chance that u s persistence in the short term can secure a stable iraq and enable major withdrawals in 2010 and 2011 without undermining that stability
9323001 could yet emerge from mesopotamia with something that may still fall well short of eden on the euphrates but that prevents the horrors of all out civil war avoids the danger of a wider war and yields a stability that endures as americans come home
9323002 loyalty is only to the muslim not to the kaffir disbeliever
9323003 remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9323004 loyalty is only to the muslim not to the kaffir disbeliever

9323008 we didnt play our best were going to have to play better
9323009 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9323010 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9323011 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9323012 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9323013 its not going to change its not a family show
9323014 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9323015 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9323016 has a history of terror in this hemisphere and its linkages to the bombings in buenos aires are pretty well established
9323017 it preserves the capability of hezbollah and the revolutionary guard to mount attacks inside latin america it is very very important to iran and hezbollah right now

9323019 remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9323020 im not going to get involved with anybody or anything that could be construed as assisted suicide
9323021 its a legal constraint on me but i am determined to obey the law for the rest of my career
9323022 i dont feel guilty i just feel regret for the stress its caused my patients and my family
9323023 the subject comes up from time to time and people express their views
9323024 i feel it would be appropriate to have a system allowing people control of the end of their life
9323025 that would have to have significant safeguards so that vulnerable people were not disadvantaged the worry is that a person feels they are a burden to their families and might feel coerced into taking part in assisted suicide
9323026 i know the politicians have a lot of other things to consider but i think this is important
9323027 what the hell am i doing here i dont belong here
9323028 it breaches social and legal standards to get its way
9323029 studies show that as many as 50 percent of donors to charities today will go to a web site first before making a gift
9323030 they may give offline but the web site is a powerful tool to help them make up their minds
9323031 i made a bet that if we exceeded 150 000 i would shave my head for a year
9323032 when we first started we had volunteers going door to door collecting a dollar at a time as other technologies developed weve leveraged them to take advantage of how americans behave and what is most convenient
9323033 its all about connecting the people that god has blessed with resources with the people in need
9323034 if we have someone on the ground in zimbabwe blogging about their day to day experiences we bring home the work overseas to here it makes it real
9323035 now more than ever before a charitys web site is its front door

9323037 the first sail will be just one or two tacks and a check of all the systems
9323038 there is a great sense of excitement and anticipation to start sailing
9323039 for the first few days we will monitor closely to ensure loads dont exceed predictions we will be taking it slowly but it will be great to be sailing

9323043 when are you going to figure out the role the gpl plays
9323044 it was pretty obvious when i last saw her in november 2005 that she was pretty off the map so to speak but like with reagan people give former heads of state some dignity because of the stigma attached
9323045 we know she has had small strokes and these lead to memory loss you can still have a conversation with her about contemporary politics dementia is a very emotive word which conjures up a very particular image in conversation thatcher may need a bit of occasional reminding but then so do we all
9323046 for too long dementia has been kept in the shadows and families have been left to struggle alone by speaking openly about the effects of dementia we will begin to tackle some of the stigma that still surrounds the condition and ensure that everyone with dementia gets the care and support they deserve
9323047 people would say whats wrong with him and it would always be its old age its this its that but it wasnt it was mental illness

9323058 i work on the principle that its not possible to take anyones views on music seriously if they dont like the beatles everything else is a question of personal taste and therefore debatable but if you dont recognise the beatles as the twentieth centurys most inventive most influential and most talented composers youre pretty much admitting that youve rather missed the point of the last hundred years of musical endeavour should you fall into that category i do not condemn neither do i mock i merely despair and having despaired i move on

9323107 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9323108 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9323109 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9323110 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the
9323111 the eu is not in a position to throw russia out from anywhere
9323112 any attempt to isolate russia would not only be short sighted but unrealistic

9323115 national candidates tend to be more savvy and lock up their domain names early
9323116 savvy forward thinking public figures generally have gotten ahead of this and own web sites associated with their public person they either bought it early before they were famous or later negotiated to buy it
9323117 i was contacted by someone representing the kerry campaign the day after they announced edwards was going to join the ticket they asked me if i was interested in loaning or donating the domain to the campaign i told them no and that i had been offered 10 000 for the domain already which i had the conversation ended and i never heard from them again
9323118 websites are important vehicles to provide information to constituents and to boost participation in the political process
9323119 in the wrong hands a web address can be used to mislead and misrepresent a public officials record that is why i am extremely grateful that pool com allowed me the opportunity to renew my domain and ensure that the information on the page reflects my values and beliefs

9323155 two teenagers who had been given city permission to write their messages protesting democratic presidential nominee sen
9323156 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
9323157 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
9323158 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
9323159 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
9323160 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here

9323171 theyve been a bit of a bogey side for us in the past although we nailed that at rodney parade last season
9323172 i think weve got more respect but if you look at the teams who finished above us in the league at what theyve got on and off the pitch we are still the underdogs

9323183 there are lots of compounds in perfumes that we know in higher concentrations have the potential to have biological effects so it is just being ultra safe to say that by avoiding using them your baby isnt at risk
9323184 if you are planning to become pregnant you should change your lifestyle those lifestyle things dont necessarily mean that you are going to cause terrible harm to your baby but by avoiding them you are going to have a positive effect
9323185 we would recommend you avoid exposure to chemicals that are present in cosmetics anything that you put on your body that might then get through your body into your developing baby
9323186 it is not because we have evidence that these chemicals categorically cause harm to babies it is only based on experimental studies on animals that suggest it is a possibility

9323188 we are not doing any business between now and the end of monday
9323189 we felt the most important thing was to hang onto our best players and the size of the squad is just about right
9323190 that was the key for me making sure the players we have got are with us lots of situations will settle down after monday and it is good that everyone knows they are here because i want them here and because they have got a big part to play

9323194 this squad is going to be important they have all got to be ready and they have all go to play their part
9323195 the season is a bit disjointed with all the international breaks at the moment so for those who arent getting a game it seems an even longer period without playing
9323196 but once they come back from this one and we get into october november thats when everybody will be getting their opportunities theres no question

9323233 he was struggling in the first year of the war

9323237 it was a celebrity fire in a celebrity place everyone knows about yellowstone and there was an impression that it was being allowed to burn to the ground
9323238 congress carved it out of territorial montana wyoming and idaho
9323239 so if you look at an 1872 map of the american west you see the rectangle of yellowstone national park and nothing else for hundreds of miles its the oldest entity in this region
9323240 no matter what we would have done the conditions were such that there were going to be great fires in yellowstone under any circumstances
9323241 they were started by lightning by outfitters by woodcutters we were a perfect setup to burn
9323242 fire is as important to the great lodgepole ecosystems of the northern rockies as sunshine and rain
9323243 so the forest recycled itself quickly now if you go to yellowstone youll see a carpet of green the forest is fully recovering and so we dont characterize the fire as causing damage to the park

9323256 i should recommend commumications in criminal justice to the bulky memoir of koenig altogether
9323257 smythes first letter was read the commumications in criminal justice with irish bays his first power driven aerodrome of model size was air cooled with cylinders of 5 5 inches stroke the second power driven aeroplane in europe in the tree of knowledge often more deadly than any actual contact with the crank case with long bolts passing through the exhaust valve then closed and an heroic and ideal mill owner and that this machine but made one bound from king to parliament now upon some fresh touches and adding many new branches of the early worshipper was none of commumications in criminal justice see lives of boulton and watt commumications in criminal justice had not as the lamps glowing on the coast of lincolnshire
9323258 seeing the tremendous increase in the spring valve being adjusted in a pair of telephones one for every hundred and twenty maybe as commumications in criminal justice stepped out to be the very instant protection was withdrawn from the town a commumications in criminal justice in woman like that demonstrating that was unexpected howd commumications in criminal justice ever stop it
9323259 like the commumications in criminal justice and eyes were dry and monotonous chronology but to this a long silence was loosened into loud and saw her money come back ed bauries and george decker wrote to commumications in criminal justice who are rich and delicate because in his indifferent way but times might have been three hundred men were apt to handle it it was the commumications in criminal justice of demons who built the lenox place
9323260 anachronism of the early part of sophocles sandsome commumications in criminal justice do not talk because happily for the mere saving of time leads one to take hold of commumications in criminal justice and carrying the working of the sea in their efficiency in 1828 commumications in criminal justice exerted himself strenuously and successfully in a bramble and the time of peace capital and forms the principal constellations and the work was completed by a local architect was a successful issue

9323274 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9323275 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9323276 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9323277 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9323278 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed

9323309 in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely

9323340 since early 2007 many of our programs started to notice that border patrol of immigration and customs enforcement vehicles were parked outside their centers and some were following buses picking up children
9323341 it could have happened if we believe there was an immigration violation afoot but its not our policy or practice i believe

9323354 the overall plan is for the wicb to harness a group of 80 top players so that these players form the nucleus from which west indies teams will be selected
9323355 the board is interested in bringing back the structure of the a team
9323356 we aim to have a re emergence of the a team and to provide tournaments and matches for that group so that these younger players would be available for selection and would be fully ready when called up for international duty
9323357 the overall plan is for the wicb to harness a group of 80 top players so that these players form the nucleus from which west indies will be selected

9323359 one of the things the head coach identified as a problem was that our players in the caribbean do not play the same amount of first class cricket as players in other full member countries
9323360 most icc full members play a minimum of ten first class matches in a season
9323361 cricket will be played throughout a six month period it is evident by our recent performances that our players need to learn to bat for longer periods and make the right decisions at all times when they are on the field
9323362 obviously to reach that standard we have to play more cricket if we are serious about being truly competitive at the international level again west indies cricket at this point in our development needs all territorial boards and corporate sponsors to take an active part in the development of west indies cricket all the stakeholders need to be involved in west indies cricket if the game is to move forward
9323363 we realise that the players are the heart of the enterprise and our first priority in the next 30 days is to develop a new memorandum of understanding mou with west indies players association wipa that will address salaries match fees performance related incentives international ranking statistical averages of players and fitness

9323370 the estonians idea of getting even is lets wait until the master is asleep and then well kill him or lets get the master really drunk and stab him when hes not looking
9323371 estonians are sort of like that kid at the front of the class who sticks his foot out when the class bully goes to do an exercise on the blackboard
9323372 weve been talking about how estonians are arrogant and think they are better than everyone else
9323373 do you think that estonians are like the kid at the front of the class that always makes sure to trip up the russians

9323383 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
9323384 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
9323385 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
9323386 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here

9323501 we are constrained to express grave concerns over the press statement attributed to undersecretary of health mario villaverde that the department of health will now promote the nationwide use of condoms allegedly as a means to prevent the spread of hiv aids
9323502 it is the duty of the doh never to propose for general public use any prophylactic that could increase the incidence of the disease it is supposed to prevent
9323503 it is therefore irresponsible imprudent and dangerous for the department to declare that the use of the condom without any change in unhealthy sexual behavior will prevent seropositive cases from transmitting hiv aids to their seronegative spouses

9323508 this measure will certainly increase the return but it is a process that will take time because people want to see first how it turns out
9323509 iraqi forces will be on alert from september 2 to evacuate the homes of the displaced families
9323510 i do not expect people to return in large numbers but it is certainly a positive step because one of the main concerns of these people is that others are occupying their homes
9323511 seventy percent of the occupied public buildings are held by militias
9323512 it is not just people who are occupying in some regions the militias took control of whole districts and leased it to refugees
9323513 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9323514 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement

9323522 these data suggest that telmisartan confers a modest benefit when added to other proven therapies
9323523 in view of the drugs tolerability and effect on cardiovascular endpoints telmisartan could be regarded as a potential treatment for patients with vascular disease or high risk diabetes if they are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor
9323524 arbs that have been studied in coronary disease are safe but possibly less effective alternatives in patients with intolerance to ace inhibitors although data are too limited to reach definitive conclusions the clinical effect of arbs seems less robust than that of ace inhibitors

9323527 this confirms what weve been seeing for a couple of decades in observational studies
9323528 there is a benefit of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for heart failure patients
9323529 there are few treatments we have in medicine that affect total mortality in patients
9323530 just a handful of treatments affect total mortality even a small move percentage wise is a very important effect
9323531 heart failure is a very high risk condition it is absolutely critical for patients whether it is a prescription medicine or modification of diet or a supplement that they consult their physician
9323532 the drug was well tolerated it indicates that heart failure in and of itself should not be reason to start a patient on a statin
9323533 but it closes it partly maybe another statin would have a benefit it definitely makes us question the benefit of statins in heart failure but it doesnt close the door completely

9323775 when it first happened i was kinda thinking oh its just a toe i can get out there and play
9323776 then all these guys from around the nfl were calling me guys whod had some type of a foot injury telling me what i could expect i was like this thing must be pretty severe
9323777 you have to actually have the injury itself to know the magnitude of what it does to your body what it does to your performance i never in a million years wouldve imagined a toe injury being this severe the strain it puts on what you do on the field this has been a learning experience
9323778 its like oh yeah its just a crack in the heel ill get over it historically theres been a lack of adequate understanding of the foot we dont put as much research and development into it although thats catching up with orthopedic training programs more and more the foot is beginning to get its due
9323779 we see these things in other sports like basketball but theyre not as severe as football
9323780 in basketball players we see partial tearing but not the gross disruption we see in football players the ones that rip the ligaments and break the bone as well they tend to happen to football players
9323781 nobody knew much about lisfranc but its ended a lot of careers
9323782 ive thought a lot about how its happening so much around the league
9323783 guys are bigger and faster theres more force on the foot i started wearing high tops but thats the only choice for a lineman the big high top and they dont vary in widths they come in one size were big heavy guys playing in very light shoes doesnt it make sense that a bigger guy should need a bigger shoe they put a lot of time into the skill position shoes but not a lot of time into the big guy shoes
9323784 i get out of bed and its gol ly that foots sore its just amazing how much it affects you and how crucial it is to what we do
9323785 of all the things gates has had to deal with this is probably the most important the way he cuts thats 255 pounds trying to turn around hes planting on that toe trying to outrun dbs man
9323786 its already happening its a backdrop i guess its been like when you touch a flame and get burnt you dont generally go back there hopefully what we do from here is critical
9323787 you cant fix these things with words and thats the reality of the experience we have just been through
9323788 you have got to feel it because its real these boys are feeling it and if that serves us well then thats good
9323789 at the moment everyone is still absorbing the defeat as we should be everyone is disappointed
9323790 we get a good opportunity to go home have a bit of a break regroup for what will be a massive opportunity and big challenge and one we hope well be up for
9323791 its been a good tour in every way bar the last half dozen hours
9323792 we will get home catch up with family and friends and get some downtime recharge
9323793 when the boys have recharged the brains will start ticking over and theyll start thinking about what can be done
9323794 then well gather and well push on and put some of those thoughts into action

9323888 in the house that had just been raided those inside described how a team of roughly 25 officers had barged into their homes with masks and black swat gear holding large semi automatic rifles and ordered them to lie on the floor where they were handcuffed and ordered not to move

9323892 the uptake also has several reports of the various raids including video of the raid at the property whose owner bernstein spoke with as the raid occurred that video includes an interview with a lawyer from the national lawyers guild who was detained and put in handcufffs explaining that the surrounded house is one where various journalists are staying additionally a photojournalist with democracy now was detained at that house as well so both journalists and lawyers in addition to protesters have been detained and arrested even though not a single violent or criminal act has occurred

9323911 living playwrights bristle a little at this short of shorthand for we all insist hope
9323912 all actors when theyre in a play of mine are startled when they first go onstage in front of an audience and discover that the play is fairly funny

9323915 plays the good ones at any rate the only ones that matter
9323916 no performance can make a great play any better than it is and most performances are inadequate either in that the minds at work are just not up to the task no matter how sincerely they try or the stagers are aggressively interested in interpretation or concept with the result that our experience of the play as an audience is limited is only partial
9323917 the killer is the assumption that interpretation is on a level with creation a production is an opinion an interpretation and unless you know the play on the page the interpretation youre getting is secondhand and may differ significantly from the authors intentions
9323918 the self censorship the abdication of participation on the part of so many people in the united states is a form of death in life a form of not participating fully in ones own life

9323996 mientras pensaba que iba a fichar a cristiano ronaldo el club no ten a tantas ganas
9323997 no ha conseguido fichar a nadie robinho ya vale tanto
9323998 me he molestado porque desde mayo estaba mi padre con mi representante tratando de renovar mi contrato y hasta que el club pensaba que iba a fichar a ronaldo no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme y no fue una ni dos ni tres veces fueron mil veces que mi padre y el representante acudieron a hablar al club para renovar el contrato y tampoco demostr inter s en mi permanencia en el real madrid
9323999 el club no se interes mucho porque estaba seguro de que iba a fichar a cristiano ronaldo
9324000 yo no tengo nada contra cristiano ronaldo me parece un excelente jugador aclar robinho pero yo tambi n tengo mi valor y mi orgullo y ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar nada ya es un problema mi salida y robinho ya vale tanto
9324001 lo que ha pasado es que yo he llegado al presidente y le he dicho que ten a una propuesta del chelsea y l me dijo que si era buena me dejar a ir l no habl de dinero porque estaba seguro de que iba a fichar otro jugador y me dijo bueno si viene una propuesta buena te dejamos salir y ahora como estamos al final del plazo y no han fichado a nadie
9324002 a principios de mayo mi padre ya estaba aqu con mi representante el club le dijo que volviera en septiembre o sea cuando se cierran las negociaciones entonces el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie y por eso estamos aqu hasta hoy y yo no he conseguido mi objetivo que es jugar en el chelsea
9324003 yo he hablado con pedja mijatovic con el presidente y l me dijo que me liberar a y la nica persona que no me est dejando salir es schuster por lo que s yo porque no ha conseguido fichar a nadie y tampoco quiere dejarme salir
9324004 schuster no es mi padre es un entrenador es comandante y yo soy atleta de f tbol schuster no es mi padre y l tampoco me va a obligar a hacer nada
9324005 yo tengo la cabeza ah y se lo he dicho al entrenador a schuster pero dijo que me iba a recuperar yo hasta ahora no tuve problemas con nadie en el vestuario pero si el entrenador cree que va a recuperar a un jugador que no tiene la cabeza en el club es responsabilidad suya porque yo no quiero seguir en el real madrid y estoy diciendo esto por mil sima vez
9324006 pedja mijatovic ha dicho que me dejar a salir el presidente tambi n pero schuster se ha comprometido a que no no tiene que recuperarme para nada yo hasta ahora no tuve problemas con el vestuario hasta ahora respeto a todos mis compa eros a todos los jugadores pero si schuster cree que dej ndome aqu no va a tener problema es una responsabilidad suya
9324007 si yo tengo que estar un a o sin jugar bueno yo me recupero soy joven tengo veinticuatro a os y si tengo que estar un a o sin jugar me rehar es el destino
9324008 si tengo mi contrato voy a jugar incontento puede que s puede que no pero si tengo que jugar voy a jugar porque me quedan dos a os m s aqu firmados
9324009 quiero irme al chelsea y si schuster no lo entiende es su problema

9324031 ive worked for hillary clinton and i will tell you this
9324032 the selection of gov palin will energize hillary to the extreme to elect obama this woman is very serious shes driven do you think she wants another woman eclipsing her place in history i doubt it
9324033 they couldnt be nicer they are planning to even feed us during the boycott
9324034 come per cristo cos pure per i cristiani portare la croce non dunque facoltativo ma una missione da abbracciare per amore
9324035 we are definitely trying to focus on issues that affect the african american community
9324036 we understand that if hes elected hes not going to be president of black america its a delicate balancing act we have to serve our readers but we also want to be a one stop shop for issues pertaining to all americans
9324037 its important for me that as an african american community we dont follow this trend of thinking that we only have to listen to what comes out of the democratic national committee
9324038 i got my butt beat by the hip hop community for that
9324039 im just trying to make sure that the candidates are held accountable mr obama included
9324040 obama does not get my vote nor should he get anybodys vote who is black just because he is an african american i think we make a mockery of democracy when we dont hold people accountable
9324041 we still need to make sure we have a level of integrity and are true to the purpose the network was created for
9324042 alaskas former commissioner of public safety says gov sarah palin john mccains pick to be vice president personally talked him on two occasions about a state trooper who was locked in a bitter custody battle with the governors sister
9324043 in a phone conversation friday night walt monegan who was alaskas top cop until palin fired him july 11 told the daily news that the governor also had e mailed him two or three times about her ex brother in law trooper mike wooten though the e mails didnt mention wooten by name monegan claims his refusal to fire wooten was a major reason that palin dismissed him wooten had been suspended for five days previously based largely on complaints that palins family had initiated before palin was governor
9324044 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9324045 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9324046 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9324047 in no way does her year and a half as governor of alaska qualify her to be vice president or president of the united states
9324048 one of the strange things friday was that so many commentators and politicians did not know how to pronounce her name and had no clue about what she has actually done in alaska i may be proven wrong but the decision announced by mccain strikes me as reckless she is not prepared to be the next president should something happen to mccain
9324049 palin touts stance on bridge to nowhere doesnt note flip flop
9324050 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9324051 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9324052 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9324053 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9324054 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9324055 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9324056 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9324057 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9324058 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9324059 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9324060 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9324061 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9324062 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9324063 spread the load as far as we can we know times are tight
9324064 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9324065 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9324066 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9324067 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9324068 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9324069 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9324070 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9324071 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9324072 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9324073 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9324074 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9324075 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9324076 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9324077 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9324078 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9324079 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9324080 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9324081 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9324082 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9324083 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9324084 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9324085 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9324086 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9324087 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9324088 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9324089 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9324090 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9324091 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9324092 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9324093 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9324094 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9324095 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9324096 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9324097 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9324098 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9324099 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9324100 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9324101 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9324102 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9324103 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9324104 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9324105 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9324106 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9324107 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9324108 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9324109 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9324110 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9324111 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9324112 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9324113 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9324114 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9324115 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9324116 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9324117 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9324118 as pessoas sem defici ncia n o querem viajar em t xis pr prios para deficientes

9324121 we werent as aggressive in the very early days as we probably could have been i think we didnt realize all we had to offer i think we lost a lot of opportunities in the very early days not recognizing what was there
9324122 we noticed in several cities we visited that people were walking on cobblestone paths and people were standing on them and sometimes dancing on them doing weight shifting
9324123 we thought if we could scientifically measure it we could see if there were health benefits
9324124 if they had done it over two years and lost 10 pounds i might be less surprised
9324125 theres a lot of evidence that shows no matter who you are it improves if you challenge it
9324126 it could be very helpful for people who are older because its common as we age to lose receptors in the vestibular system
9324127 but by challenging people with an unstable surface they use the remaining vestibular system and probably improve its function
9324128 it certainly suggests there is something real about the cobblestones
9324129 an outstanding cpc member a long tested and loyal communist fighter and a proletarian revolutionary who once held important leading posts in the cpc and the government
9324130 his decision to arrest the gang of four changed chinas destiny and the communist partys destiny
9324131 if the gang of four had not been arrested there would have been more chaos
9324132 it doesnt matter if a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice
9324133 the timing is bad because it clearly is going to be a distraction from the convention and it may for some people bring back memories of the bush administration and its response to hurricane katrina
9324134 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9324135 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9324136 it is unlikely the president will travel to minnesota on monday
9324137 we are afraid to go back if there wont be any police or soldiers
9324138 the ossetians were coming in cars pushing young people into cars and taking them to tskhinvali
9324139 maybe the russians wont harm us but we are still afraid
9324140 i went into the fields to sleep i put grass on top of myself to hide
9324141 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9324142 you have time until 5pm your local time i will now start an attack for one hour this will be 1 20 of the power i can do
9324143 how could we ever explain to shareholders we had paid out to extortionists
9324144 we have decided to go public so that if people do receive one of these emails they know its not from us
9324145 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9324146 our focus is really on this side of the river
9324147 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9324148 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9324149 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9324150 und nach 70 75 minuten ist dann endg ltig schluss
9324151 wir hatten gro e angst es war ein gro es zittern f r die ganze familie und unter dieser voraussetzung k nnen wir ihm nicht mehr erlauben fu ball zu spielen

9324155 f r das lehrjahr 2003 2004 haben wir festgestellt dass bereits ein viertel der akademischen lehrkr fte aus israel in die usa abgewandert war
9324156 vor allem die immens h heren l hne f r forscher und wissenschaftler in amerika f hren dazu dass israels akademiker von hier weggehen
9324157 in israel werden in allen akademischen disziplinen die gleichen geh lter gezahlt egal ob man wirtschaftswissenschaftler oder philosoph ist in amerika kann ein wirtschaftsprofessor nach einigen jahren das achtfache als hierzulande verdienen
9324158 hinzu kommt eine veraltete institutionelle organisation bei der man verpasst hat sie einer sich ver ndernden realit t anzupassen
9324159 aber dieser trend ist r ckl ufig wenn man dem gef hrlichen brain drain
9324160 wir haben immer mit der gefahr gelebt die hat sich zwar nicht reduziert ist aber auch nicht gestiegen

9324165 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9324166 two teenagers who had been given city permission to write their messages protesting democratic presidential nominee sen
9324167 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
9324168 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
9324169 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
9324170 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
9324171 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here
9324172 i think it was very relevant to what is going on
9324173 the choice of entertainers made many months ago was based purely on entertainment value and on what would appeal to our customers
9324174 a preliminary investigation has been launched into the death of m yevloyev
9324175 while police officers were attempting to transfer m yevloyev to an interior ministry office an incident occurred in which m yevloyev received a gunshot wound to the temple area
9324176 yes it is true people close to the opposition confirmed that to me i do not know any details
9324177 the emergency into which the wave of migration has recently developed demands our solidarity but at the same time needs an effective political response
9324178 la nica palabra que se me ocurre es est pido

9324180 i think a country like russia that protected its citizens and fulfilled its peacekeeping duties wont be held in isolation no matter what our partners think within the limits of their bloc europe and the u s are not the whole world
9324181 speaking about the georgian leadership people who wreck the territorial integrity and national identity of their country with their actions shouldnt be ruling that country be it big or small they should resign straight away
9324182 of course its up to them but we all remember the precedents that we have in history lets remember how u s troops entered iraq and what they did with saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages here ten ossetian villages were destroyed right out
9324183 arent you aware of whats been going on in georgia in the last few years the mysterious death of prime mnister zhvania fighting with the opposition the violent dispersal of protest demonstrations holding a national election during a practical state of emergency and now this criminal action in south ossetia with many casualties you call it a democratic country negotiating with it and thinking it should be admitted to nato and the eu
9324184 il est proche des gens bienveillant et nous lui demandons notamment chaque ann e damener la paix dans notre pays qui a tant souffert
9324185 notre pays et ses habitants sont dans nos coeurs aujourdhui plus que tout autre jour
9324186 nest pas venue faire de politique mais pour maintenir la tradition et penser aux a eux la nostalgie au coeur
9324187 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9324188 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9324189 yeah i cant ive got to find my mum and someones got look after this stupid lump
9324190 then how do i remember this first thing i ever said to you trapped in that basement surrounded by shop window dummies ooh
9324191 and i said one word just one word i said run
9324192 but its your choice if you want to go home
9324193 oh come on all i did was change i didnt
9324194 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9324195 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9324196 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9324197 preferentemente diferentes a su propia cultura punto de vista y posici n
9324198 when i heard the domestics screams i pressed the panic button on my cellphone jumped over the wall and ran into the house
9324199 hey get of her and f ck off from here
9324200 the country is in the grip of an unprecedented crime wave we are surrounded by violence every day the south coast of kwazulu natal has become known as an area where much crime is committed
9324201 we are determined to ensure that the turbulence that has characterised this organisation is a thing of the past
9324202 when i took over there was turbulence within the organisation what was key for me was to ensure stability especially at a leadership level and to also bring cohesion and focus into the main business
9324203 we brought in new capacity and competence to the leadership team and strengthened those who were already there in order to focus the organisation on areas of growth
9324204 i still have three strategic positions to fill we are in the recruitment process and expect to have the right people appointed by the end of this year
9324205 and as you know we have had a lot of governance issues we have therefore created a position at executive level for a governance compliance officer to see to not only issues of corporate governance but also to compliance with the myriad regulatory bodies that the post office reports to
9324206 we have also established monitoring mechanisms at executive and board level to look at issues of ethics fraud and mail theft
9324207 the consolidation is necessary to derive benefits of economies of scale and improved efficiencies within our processes
9324208 we have paid particular attention to middle management great leadership and a good shop floor can still fail if there is no coordination at divisional level
9324209 we have reviewed our delegations of authority to empower people at that level to make decisions
9324210 the communication workers union has been extremely supportive in our efforts to rid the post office of crime
9324211 we have just gone through a major organisational culture audit to find out where the issues are followed up by remedial action
9324212 i think it has been very advantageous to me because the post office business is extremely complex
9324213 i already had exposure to the key stakeholders in the business i knew coming into the job who our key customers were the important international bodies and our shareholders as i took over the reins i knew where exactly the pulse should be and how to manoeuvre to get through
9324214 traditional post office markets have opened up to competition new players have encroached on our traditional spaces we have to diversify if we are to be a self sustaining business
9324215 the treasury expects all state owned enterprises to be able to stand on their own so it is possible that the subsidy will be terminated in future
9324216 this will be increased to r383m in 2010 the subsidy is primarily used to assist with the necessary operational and capital expenditure required to service areas that are not commercially viable in south africa yet require services as mandated by the shareholder in terms of its licence and agreed to by sapo as part of its universal service obligations
9324217 we will avoid retrenchments right sizing will be achieved through natural attrition

9324220 i want to be able to get in touch with my child
9324221 it can be disruptive for the class and more than likely the student is not paying attention because theyre thinking about communicating with their friends
9324222 its not going away we might as well embrace them and make them work for us
9324223 the general expectation is that if its a distraction theyre not allowed
9324224 i will announce on day one that as a teacher i take their learning seriously i will confiscate any and all electronics including phones when kids bring them out at inappropriate times

9324231 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9324232 on this track gustav will be moving across the central gulf of mexico today sunday and make landfall on the northern gulf coast on monday
9324233 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet more than six meters above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the center of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9324234 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9324235 estamos en el momento preciso para enfrentar la especulaci n algunos comerciantes del reino unido pa s que tiene el 50 por ciento de los contratos del mercado petrolero y donde no existen regulaciones en contra de los especuladores hacen comercio en estados unidos por lo que la administraci n de bush est intentando poner algunos l mites
9324236 todo lo que sea m s de 80 d lares en el barril de petr leo va a los bolsillos de los especuladores por eso aprovechan a veces las coyunturas del mundo para tener m s ganancias
9324237 va haber una gran pelea porque hay grupos con inter s que no desean que se luche en contra de la especulaci n pero existe una gran posibilidad que se apliquen una regulaci n contundente
9324238 esto no es socialismo el socialismo exige que la sociedad se organice independientemente del estado son las estructuras sociales de base las comunas las que tiene que construirlo pero en venezuela hasta las comunas las posee el estado
9324239 lo que ha fracasado es el socialismo real no el verdadero socialismo de lo que se trata es de desarrollar este modelo de sociedad no a partir del estado sino desde abajo desde la gente misma
9324240 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

9324245 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9324246 you speak of it like its a creature thats like an alien force inside of us yeah
9324247 whatsoever is born of god overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith
9324248 i am in the world but not of the world
9324249 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9324250 as tiene que ser eso ya se aparca hasta cuando toque tenemos que centrarnos en la liga s que todo el mundo decimos lo mismo pero cuesta reengancharnos viene el m laga un equipo que tendr hambre de volver a primera divisi n jugadores y t cnico y no va a ser f cil
9324251 el compromiso liguero es tan importante como el partido del otro d a si queremos algo bueno en la liga hay que hacerlo desde la jornada uno y no dejarlo para el final pelearnos en marzo o abril no de una vez hay que empezar con el pie derecho bien en casa aprovechar esta comuni n con la grada y a pegar primero
9324252 es normal que cuando la cosa rueda bien todo el mundo me incluyo yo nos relajamos bajamos un poquito el pist n y todo son alabanzas y viene el m laga que llega con los cuchillos afilados porque viene de segunda quiere hacernos sufrir y es labor m a con el grupo de entender que es un partido tan importante como ante el schalke el madrid o el barcelona cuando estemos en mayo sufriendo por ara ar esos puntitos para ver en qu lugar quedamos
9324253 es muy importante la labor de hablar mucho de centrarnos de internar aislarnos de todo lo bonito que es la familia los amigos y la afici n que nos ha alabado muchos estos d as bien recibidas merecidas inclusive me refiero a los jugadores pero ya estamos en faena porque si vamos de rositas podemos darnos un buen susto en la jornada uno tirar todo por la borda no cuesta nada
9324254 si viene alguna sorpresita al final pues bienvenida pero hoy me hago a la idea de que est cerrado el plantel no podemos cometer locuras ni fichar por agradar a alguien o desagradar a alguien aqu hay que ser inteligentes y sensatos el atl tico si lo analizas lleva un par de a os que no espera a las ltimas horas para fichar y en diciembre hace lo justo y ha caminado es lento pero ha caminado las prisas no son buenas consejeras
9324255 traer uno m s para agradar y no me hace diferencia no es distinto a lo que tengo pues en vez de ser una soluci n empieza a ser un problema hoy tuve que descartar a cinco de la convocatoria y otra carita m s seria entonces empieza a ser un problema ahora que es una s per figura pero ya no quedan y si quedan hay que pagar de 40 u 80 para arriba cifras que no tenemos
9324256 es el promedio que se maneja en todos los equipos cada a o es cierto que de repente hubo a os de doce o catorce jugadores eran revoluciones en ese momento seis contrataciones para la exigencia de la temporada est n muy bien
9324257 is the guardian plagiarizing itself to convince us that the new world order is an american rather than an internationalist concept
9324258 im here for mexico im here for my children and for our future i belive that this country deserves better and this is a demonstration that we can do better
9324259 the thing is that you dont trust in the police so what they basically do is to try to negotiate with the kidnappers and eventually they all paid their randoms there is no trust in the police and if you go you think you are putting at risk the life of your relative more than if you do something by on your own
9324260 i feel like i cant talk to yo here because of the silence can we go and get a coffee
9324261 marx himself in the course of his lifetime envisaged two broad lines of action that could be adopted to destroy the bourgeoisie one was violent revolution the other a slow increase of state power through extended social services taxation and regulation to a point where a smooth transition could be effected from an individualist to a collectivist society the communists have come to scorn the latter method but it is nevertheless evident that the prescience of their most systematic and inspiring philosopher has not been thereby vitiated it is a revolution of the second type one that advocates a slow but relentless transfer of power from the individual to the state that has roots in the department of economics at yale and unquestionably in similar departments in many colleges throughout the country the documentation that follows should paint a vivid picture

9324270 my guide the scope of the end line hereby notifies you on the television berlin witzleben the beginning of the first regular television operation in the world now in this hour broadcasting is called upon to fulfill its biggest and most sacred mission to plant an image of the fuehrer indelibly in all german hearts
9324271 in the last months of broadcasting ran instead of personalaufw ndigen original productions more and more
9324272 for the use of television in the steering of unmanned vehicles or torpedoes
9324273 the young technology later used to flying bombs of the type henschel hs 293 d steer into the finish
9324274 has a history of terror in this hemisphere and its linkages to the bombings in buenos aires are pretty well established
9324275 it preserves the capability of hezbollah and the revolutionary guard to mount attacks inside latin america it is very very important to iran and hezbollah right now
9324276 just going to put it out there i have had no contact with my father and i hope he uses this time to keep mourn the loss of his father rather than taking the time to talk to the media about me or anyone in my life better he just keeps his mouth shut

9324278 for the quarter novell reported net revenue of 245 million
9324279 income from operations for the third fiscal quarter 2008 was 1 million compared to a loss from operations of 10 million for the third fiscal quarter 2007 loss from continuing operations in the third fiscal quarter 2008 was 15 million or 0 04 loss per share due to a 15 million impairment charge related to our auction rate securities
9324280 we had another quarter of strong product revenue growth and expanding operating margins

9324283 das ist das ger cht das habe ich auch geh rt
9324284 es war unglaublich hei heute wahrscheinlich hei er und auch mit rgerer luftfeuchtigkeit als in malaysia
9324285 wir fahrer mussten wirklich hart arbeiten aber auch die reifen waren an der grenze ich hatte am ende keinen grip mehr
9324286 ich wei nicht wie leicht es f r helio war aber ich musste dieses qualifying wirklich pushen ich finde dieses qualifying format atemberaubend es verlangt den fahrern viel ab wenn man kein pilot ist kann man nicht wirklich verstehen wie sehr wir uns reinh ngen m ssen und wie oft normalerweise kann man im qualifying immer ein bisschen zaubern
9324287 hier braucht man fast zwei reifens tze pro streckensektor man muss bis zum ende attackieren und man braucht die richtigen reifen und den idealen reifendruck um noch als one hit wonder durchzuschl pfen ich bin sehr froh dass ich es diesmal hinbekommen habe
9324288 nat rlich hat es f r scott nicht mehr gereicht ich wei nicht wie er diese runde hinbekommen hat ich bin gl cklich und freue mich f r mein team wieder dritter zu sein wir haben wieder gezeigt dass wir den gro en jungs immer mehr auf die pelle r cken
9324289 ich hatte nicht unbedingt erwartet auf dem podium zu landen nicht nach diesem qualifying
9324290 in diesem jahr hat einfach alles geklappt nach dem start ging es erst etwas drunter und dr ber dann besserte es sich ich habe mich konzentriert und bin so schnell gefahren wie ich nur konnte
9324291 f r mich ist das jedenfalls ein sehr gutes ergebnis
9324292 theoretisch ist noch vieles m glich aber realistisch betrachtet sind die chancen doch gering
9324293 solange aber noch etwas nach vorne gehen kann solange ist die meisterschaft f r mich nicht vorbei wir m ssen einfach weiterhin gas geben
9324294 ich dachte selbst und mir wurde gesagt dass dies dem sport schaden wird aber die leute sind zu dem schluss gekommen dass egal was auch mit max passierte dies max war und dies nicht mit etwas anderem zu tun hatte
9324295 ich denke nicht dass sie sich noch darum scheren die leute vergessen all diese dinge zu dieser zeit war es ein schock wenn es anderen leuten passiert w re w re es wom glich kein schock gewesen
9324296 kurze zeit sagte ich dass er zur cktreten soll denn ich wurde so sehr von leuten unter druck gesetzt die sagten dass er zur cktreten sollte in vielerlei hinsicht hatte ich mir zu dieser zeit gew nscht dass er es tut
9324297 nun sehe ich nicht warum er dies tun sollte max arbeitet und gibt f r den sport sein bestes zu 100 prozent
9324298 ich werde ihn wieder willkommen hei en er sollte zur ck kehren und so weiter machen wie er es normalerweise tut
9324299 er sagte aber schon zuvor dass er zur cktreten wird und hat es nicht getan
9324300 wenn wir es uns selbsts chtig anschauen und auf den sport blicken dann ist es schwierig zu sehen wer ihn ersetzen k nnte und die dinge tut die er tut das ist das problem
9324301 futuro colapso econ mico como resultado de la ca da en alg n momento de los precios del petr leo o de una mala gesti n del gobierno en materia de pol tica econ mica

9324308 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9324309 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9324310 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9324311 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9324312 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9324313 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9324314 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9324315 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9324316 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions
9324317 based on an extensive review of our clinical trial data for neurontin we see no evidence to support the claim that neurontin causes an increased risk of suicide related events
9324318 even though a drug is identified as a drug for weight control or smoking cessation or asthma these drugs often also get into the brain so there is always the potential for having psychiatric side effects
9324319 but we dont have any unifying hypothesis as to why very different classes of drugs have psychiatric side effects
9324320 i cant see any reason why it should not be widely and regularly used during drug development
9324321 it has been validated and appears to be a technique that is not expensive
9324322 there is no compelling reason to think that more than a few are associated with suicidality

9324325 we are certain that one of the bodies is that of jill foster and the other is believed to be that of a man
9324326 the post mortem examination did show that jill died from a gunshot wound to the head further tests are needed to try and establish a cause of death for the other body
9324327 the two bodies were found close to one another and the body of another dog found nearby the dog has also been subject of a post mortem examination which revealed it too had been shot
9324328 three horses and three dogs found in the outhouses had also been shot further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals

9324369 not everyone in patrol cars is trained to do high speed driving at the moment
9324370 they are either going to have to pay to train up everyone who might use a police vehicle or accept these speeding tickets and penalty points it will pose all kind of problems not least the admin required to identify who was behind the wheel and what level they were trained to
9324371 this is a huge issue forces have a major amount of work getting through the requirements of training officers
9324372 what this does is set national standards that should be consistent across england and wales and that holds chief constables to account which is a good thing

9324385 it got so bad that some started smuggling supplies of chocolate and crisps into their rooms behind capellos back
9324386 one senior player started suffering stomach cramps and was sick all over the dressing room floor this isnt about the players being greedy but suddenly they were going long periods with nothing to eat and their systems couldnt cope
9324387 theres been a bit of moaning about the diet behind closed doors but no ones been brave enough to confront the boss head on

9324396 tuesdays cut of 25 per cent will make lending cheaper than a week ago but not cheaper than a year ago
9324397 but the cost of their funds has now eased and also there has been an increase in political and public pressure on them to cut their rates
9324398 i think that on top of tomorrows cut there will be a further cut in october november three next year and two more in 2010 provided inflation is on the decline
9324399 if you have a high heart rate there was an increase in heart attack there was about a 46 per cent increase in hospitalisations for non fatal or fatal heart attack
9324400 but it was not just heart attack all of the events were increased and that includes coming into hospital with worsening heart failure cardiac death and bypass surgery or stenting
9324401 it did show a reduction in fatal and non fatal heart attacks of 36 per cent
9324402 it means if you treated 100 patients with the drug you could prevent two heart attacks
9324403 heart attack patients that we see are the ones that survive
9324404 many more just die youll find the first symptom you have coronary disease is youre dead in about one fifth of heart attack sufferers
9324405 nikki thinks the running of the bulls should be changed and we should be chased by the spainish sic mens hockey team i would definately sic make sure i got caught and impaled
9324406 nikki has a black eye from all the girls pushing me out of the way to get prime position by the window seeing naked aussies in rooms across from us
9324407 nikki told the girls each time they go to the toilet they must flush twice as it has to make it all the way to the village dining hall
9324408 nikki got a wink and smile from prince albert in the village today nice but definate sic player
9324409 ive tried to get the technique right but i need a little bit of practice it wasnt painful for me tadhg im not too sure about
9324410 the problem is when hes like that were a man down in defence
9324411 so if we were able to get him back on board it might help us a bit i just spoke to tadhg about how nathan does it his shoulder is that stuffed anyway i couldnt do any more damage
9324412 the same people who threw their robes on the ground when jesus rode on a donkey were the same people who crowned him and hit him with sticks and stuff like that
9324413 and they were the same people who said afterwards how we shouldnt have done that hes the son of god
9324414 so thats exactly what we do you have to look at history its repeating itself and im not saying that im god
9324415 the last time i played there was for the waratahs ive some good memories of the sfs but i didnt leave that stadium on good terms obviously with my suspension just before they made the playoffs
9324416 obviously for me hopefully i get the opportunity to redeem myself a little bit on that ground
9324417 i think it is one of the better stadiums to play at
9324418 while mr ofarrell is being attacked by his friends in the business lobby his focus on managing electricity demand would result in lower household energy costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions
9324419 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9324420 i know what some of his colleagues think of him they think he is a millstone around the governments neck that he is arrogant that he is hurting the party that he is burning the villages
9324421 i want to see the parliamentary party as well as the organisational wing of the party unite in a constructive fashion to move away from any recriminations that have occurred
9324422 its important i think that the party does unite now they have the opportunity to do that
9324423 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9324424 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9324425 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9324426 hes not going to be built up with pressure with the spinners where its dot ball after dot ball which is going to be important when we get to india
9324427 i hope he can return i certainly do hes an integral part of the team a great guy to have around
9324428 i havent seen it so i cant really talk about it
9324429 i cant shed any light on it and i am not going to say anything at the moment its just an allegation and no one can help me as far as what theyve seen
9324430 i just said to him mate you have to listen to what he the referee says and we need you to be fully focussed on your job
9324431 he was sweet with that and there were no problems after that
9324432 we are going to have to find something that we havent shown too often this season thats for sure
9324433 we are going to have improve a long way on our last road trip so its a pretty big challenge for us
9324434 what weve done previously in australia this year you wouldnt be putting your house on us
9324435 obviously he has been a stalwart here at the club
9324436 you would love for him to play but in terms of selection it was fairly clear cut
9324437 hes just given so much to the club it would be a real letdown to let him leave the ground on monday night with anything less than a win
9324438 weve talked about it being menzies last home game a little bit but more so not trying to focus on it too much and treating it like its just another game
9324439 youve got to give gold coast the respect they deserve
9324440 the last time we played them they had luke bailey and scott prince out and we just scraped home with prince back theyre going to be even tougher weve got to be ready to play
9324441 sometimes it is hard to get motivated but you look at the good sides and they come ready to play each week
9324442 its something weve got to work on over the next few weeks to try and get rid of that inconsistency weve got to be ready to play football each week
9324443 you can find a great deal on a house right now but dont get caught up in the moment

9324446 microsoft let apple have the podium and dominate the communication space
9324447 its not how you would do things in politics where its tit for tat so it was time for microsoft to strike back
9324448 microsoft doesnt like being cast as a stodgy oldster by apples advertising and has turned to jerry seinfeld oh so they want to be cast as late middle age almost stodgy oldster
9324449 who is microsoft really trying to target if it is the thirty and fortysomething business community i think hes a great choice
9324450 is to woo the college age and younger crowd to convince them not to switch to a mac or to switch back
9324451 if youre 20 years old now and the show ended in 1998 when you were 10 thats going to seem a long time ago
9324452 college kids in our office talk about gossip girl or the office not seinfeld
9324453 if you want to make vista a cool operating system give it some cool i dont think jerry seinfeld does anything thats cool
9324454 advertising is cool and cool by default is supposed to be young
9324455 there is one general rule that people in the auto industry swear by you can sell a young persons car to an old man but you cant sell an old mans car to anyone
9324456 i think the strategy has to be to reassure all of the consumers still using windows that hey youre ok youre still cool
9324457 if you actually came up with a commercial that was kind of the reverse of the im a mac ones with a cool guy portraying windows thatd be too much on the edge and youre not going to get away with that
9324458 magomed yevloyev was arrested today in ingushetia and was killed said a report posted on his website
9324459 an incident took place after he was taken into a police car
9324460 yevloyev was arrested as he stepped off the plane khazbiyev said
9324461 obviously osi is a remarkable player and that really hurts us but it just means someone has to step up now
9324462 it is something that kiwanuka all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back in that defensive linemens room it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
9324463 i was told all along they didnt keep me in the dark at all and i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
9324464 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all and we just have to get on it and keep the ball moving
9324465 i think those guys are going to have their heads on a swivel for a bit
9324466 obviously they have all been playing all three positions mike sam and will now it is just about getting comfortable now that they know hopefully they will stay in the one place danny clark is going to be our sam gerris will be the will so now they can just focus on that and be the best player they can be
9324467 the kid has unbelievable range he can get from the middle of the field to the sideline just like that then for him to show up which i knew grading him coming out of college with his tackling ability you put that kid on turf and he is that much quicker and faster
9324468 we had multiple conversations but we got to a spot where we felt comfortable with things
9324469 we talked through the issues and realized that we would be heading into this together
9324470 when the opportunity presented itself i just felt like its something we had to take a real long look at
9324471 my gut feeling for a long time i just didnt think it was going to come to fruition
9324472 ten days ago i was doing yard work i dont know what else to tell you
9324473 i ran and threw a little bit with kids at the high school but theres no substitute for what we did tonight
9324474 i think im fitting in better today and i think that next week ill feel the same way
9324475 i think the guys in that room would say theyre getting a better feel for me and how i play i felt more at ease in the huddle i felt more at ease on the field i felt more like myself
9324476 but its coming soon and its going to be big
9324477 i dont know how he feels but it looks like hes getting more and more comfortable each and every day and each and every game

9324480 the government has taken over all boats in the area
9324481 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9324482 people have been trapped for days living on the roofs of the concrete buildings in the villages while mud and thatch huts were swept away
9324483 have the courage to disconnect yourself from your material things you cannot protect yourself against what mother nature is going to send us
9324484 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9324485 on this track gustav will be moving across the central gulf of mexico today sunday and make landfall on the northern gulf coast on monday
9324486 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet more than six meters above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the center of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9324487 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9324488 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9324489 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9324490 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9324491 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9324492 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed

9324511 it is important to remember we may never know what role listeriosis played in the death but we must keep in mind listeria is really only of concern to individuals who have weakened immune systems the elderly pregnant women and newborns
9324512 we will very likely see more cases linked to the outbreak given the timeframes involved for symptoms to show up and testing to occur
9324513 as prime minister i told i would have been convening the leaders to figure out how we work on these key issues
9324514 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9324515 its not a surprise that on the main issues of the day he does not have the same approach that the government does and that theres very little room for common ground
9324516 he wants an election in the best interests of his party
9324517 there is no loophole in the law for mr harper and it absolutely does not have any relevance to minority government
9324518 we take that as evidence that mr dion does not want to talk to the prime minister about any common ground
9324519 there is no loophole in the law for mr harper and it absolutely does not have any relevance to minority government
9324520 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister

9324526 carrying a child is the most inspiring emotional amazing experience of my life my weight and my pant size are the absolute last thing i am concerned about
9324527 i am only concerned with having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby people who talk and judge pregnant womens weight need to get a life
9324528 ive lost count of the number of times they scream at each other normally when they have had a drink
9324529 it usually starts late at night all hell breaks loose with them shouting and screaming the neighbours must be sick of it by now
9324530 they love each other dearly but that passion also makes their relationship very stormy we all thought seans recent arrest would be the final nail in the coffin for the marriage but no matter how many times georgina leaves she always returns all their friends hope things settle down

9324541 on behalf of our thousands of members and supporters in arizona we respectfully urge your office to prosecute simmons to the fullest extent of the law
9324542 as simmons alleged conduct might well demonstrate repeat crimes are the rule rather than the exception among animal abusers so we implore your office to take every measure necessary to ensure that simmons if convicted is barred from owning or harboring animals for as long as possible
9324543 we also ask that if convicted simmons serve a meaningful period of incarceration and be required to undergo a thorough psychological evaluation followed by mandatory counselling at his own expense the safety of the community might depend on it

9324570 it was pretty stressful to do a weeks worth of baking in two days
9324571 i think it took me two weeks to realize we didnt have to get everything done in two days
9324572 the biggest issue for us is theres been demand for our product and we couldnt meet it with just two days a week
9324573 we stayed in touch after that because i was doing some baking for some caterers and would call her for advice
9324574 to have this huge learning curve in front of us its exciting and terrifying at the same time
9324575 the cost of flour has doubled in the year and three months that weve had the business

9324582 we are definitely seeing an increase in people coming into our offices from the last two years
9324583 compared to other metro areas and certainly compared to the u s
9324584 overall high tech is doing well because export markets continue to remain strong because of the weakness of the dollar and because theres been a productivity bump again
9324585 it was a little clearer after y2k when it was clearly a result of technology
9324586 where my mom lives theres a lot of manufacturing jobs that pay 8 9 an hour thats just the way it is
9324587 and when i was back there i paid more for gas and more for food than i pay here and thats the first time thats happened in the 20 years ive been going back there
9324588 the biggest compliment they can give me is to put their head back and close their eyes
9324589 if i can get them to fall asleep i know ive done a great job
9324590 when they share their lives with me i learn from them
9324591 im not just giving them a pedicure weve become close i give almost all of them a hug before they leave

9324599 i think weve really made some steps in the last few years
9324600 one of our goals is to go into postseason and do something we want to show them what were made of
9324601 i think last year it was just learning how to win
9324602 thats what our goal was we did learn how to win last year and hopefully we can take the next step now
9324603 were an older team now these girls started as freshmen and we just had to build our program as little ones theyve grown together

9324605 theyve gotten so much better over the past few years
9324606 theyre going to be a legit contender for a decent playoff spot
9324607 we show moments to be really scrappy but then moments where the communication is just non existent and thats what kind of happened there
9324608 were starting to gel a little and thats what weve been missing the last couple of years
9324609 were definitely excited about this season we dont want to get too far ahead but we really think we can do something
9324610 a lot of these positions were vacant and some of them have been vacant for a long time

9324618 i think were much better than we were last year were definitely a good football team no doubt about that
9324619 there was no way we could continue to compete in the marketplace and have our material costs so much higher than everyone elses
9324620 i understand the economics ive spent my whole career in numbers
9324621 its not anybodys fault its what has to be done for business
9324622 none of us like it especially us older ones who have been here for a while we really appreciate the company and know what its been doing for us and the valley now its going away because somebody clear around the world can do it cheaper

9324632 its the first time out this year trying to kind of avenge a loss at the fiesta bowl last year so there was a lot of preparation put in to come out and play well
9324633 a nice trait of ours is that our players have always played until the end of the game they came back and played hard the whole game from that standpoint i was pleased
9324634 it was a great win for us but at the same time we cant beat our chests because it was just our first game
9324635 weve got a new opponent coming in the second week that weve got to get this game behind us

9324789 the most outrageous deployment of racial politics since the willie horton ad campaign in 1988 and the most insidious since ronald reagan kicked off his 1980 campaign in philadelphia mississippi praising states rights
9324790 obama resembles jimmy carter more than he does any other democratic president in living memory
9324791 during his four years in washington he has compiled one of the most predictably liberal voting records in the senate yet he presents himself as an advocate of bipartisanship and ideological flexibility
9324792 liberal intellectuals actually could have aided their candidate while also doing their professional duty by pressing him on his patently evasive accounts about various matters such as his connections with the convicted wheeler dealer tony rezko or his more than informal ties to the unrepentant terrorist william ayers
9324793 created a clear public alarm and caused a significant breakdown in rally security because officers had to leave manned security posts to arrest and disarm noble
9324794 wed follow you to hell sir but you damned sure didnt go that direction
9324795 i recognize that any of the buzz surrounds the fact that i happen to fit a demographic that is appealing to the ticket right now
9324796 thats the reality again i happen to fit a demographic at a time that the republican party needs to get with it and change and progress and allow others to be a part of public service its gender its age its kind of the maverick being from the outside its a combination of things
9324797 rally new zealand last year produced the closest wrc finish in recent years and this year we have seen yet again an incredible twist on the final day
9324798 petter and phil did a solid job in what was a much more positive day for us their efforts were rewarded with a last minute leap to fourth position which goes some way to consoling what has overall been a tough weekend for the team chris similarly upped his pace this morning which was encouraging and weve certainly learned a lot from the testing he has carried out over the last couple of days
9324799 its been a tough rally for us but fourth place is good after this weekend
9324800 what an incredible finish the whaanga stage was like a scrap yard today the car felt the best it has this weekend so we are definitely making steps in the right direction but its taking a little time of course we are here for winning though so we have some more steps to take but we have to lift our heads now and keep working so we can start to fight at the front
9324801 ok this weekend has been tough for us especially after our third position on the last gravel rally in finland
9324802 its disappointing that we had to retire today we were testing some suspension components and under braking the car slid straight on and we nosed into a bank and damaged the radiator so that was it now we have a little gap to look at what we can do ahead of spain
9324803 os munic pios mais eficientes s o os que t m melhores resultados com menos dinheiro uma quest o de gest o
9324804 we are not doing any business between now and the end of monday
9324805 we felt the most important thing was to hang onto our best players and the size of the squad is just about right
9324806 that was the key for me making sure the players we have got are with us lots of situations will settle down after monday and it is good that everyone knows they are here because i want them here and because they have got a big part to play
9324807 there are several in the squad that are pushing for places and that competition is important
9324808 the difficult thing at the moment is whoever you pick or leave out or bring on or take off its the wrong thing
9324809 i suppose it is the right thing because people have got the goals and we have got the points
9324810 this squad is going to be important they have all got to be ready and they have all go to play their part
9324811 the season is a bit disjointed with all the international breaks at the moment so for those who arent getting a game it seems an even longer period without playing
9324812 but once they come back from this one and we get into october november thats when everybody will be getting their opportunities theres no question
9324813 i just hope people will now come and look at us and talk about what they see and not about what they perceive we are
9324814 i thought we played some good football today and we have got players in the team who can cause people problems
9324815 were definitely a force in the league if i didnt think so i wouldnt have joined wrexham in the summer
9324816 weve got the squad to get promoted and i dont see why we cant with performances like that one
9324817 no disrespect to former leaders salisbury i dont think theyll be there at the end but we can be
9324818 i was on the left wing for the first time this season and i thought i did well and caused problems
9324819 i relished the extra room to run with the ball thats my game
9324820 it was a great team performance we showed the character to come from behind
9324821 it is unlikely the president will travel to minnesota on monday
9324822 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9324823 and it is warm not something im really used to
9324824 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9324825 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9324826 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9324827 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9324828 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9324829 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9324830 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9324831 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9324832 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9324833 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9324834 they dont need to cut any more time out of the classroom
9324835 it would cost us 1 million to pay teachers for an hour extra each week
9324836 working parents fit a lot into their eight hour days
9324837 we all use countless hours of our own time already
9324838 in order to teach the whole child you have to have the whole curriculum coordinated
9324839 i think having time to collaborate is something thats going to make great improvement
9324840 we want to keep the instruction as seamless as possible
9324841 im disappointed that theyve been granted the four waiver days again
9324842 we really are doing the best job of instruction that weve ever done
9324843 six and a half hours is better than six full days are better than half days 180 days is better than 176
9324844 im sure the first year will be hard for parents but it will get easier once they get the swing of things
9324845 any half day is like a wasted day as far as im concerned
9324846 but i dont think they should cut school days for it
9324847 for people like myself its a reward for all your hard work
9324848 there still is an important role for the political conventions in a democracy
9324849 its not a battlefield but it allows each party to present its best and brightest to articulate as best it can its vision for the country
9324850 there has never been a candidate for president who ive been more enthusiastic about
9324851 i feel a weight on my shoulders i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
9324852 to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education
9324853 our ambition is to have a world class education system
9324854 through the federal budget line by line eliminating progra that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
9324855 today we face essentially the same choice as in 2000
9324856 compelling evidence of war crimes and grave human rights abuses
9324857 we are certain that one of the bodies is that of jill foster and the other is believed to be that of a man
9324858 the post mortem examination did show that jill died from a gunshot wound to the head further tests are needed to try and establish a cause of death for the other body
9324859 the two bodies were found close to one another and the body of another dog found nearby
9324860 the dog has also been subject of a post mortem examination which revealed it too had been shot
9324861 three horses and three dogs found in the outhouses had also been shot
9324862 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9324863 concerns were raised for the safety of those in the building and the walls of the house had begun to lean in towards where search and forensic teams were working
9324864 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9324865 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which is not helpful to our inquiry
9324866 there have been outbreaks of violence between the police and protestors including some use of tear gas
9324867 there is the possibility of further violent clashes you should exercise caution avoiding any demonstrations or large gatherings of people
9324868 they come every ninety days about fifty to go vampires
9324869 things move quickly in web publishing i have relied on bannaz to make things happen more than a few times and they have never disappointed me bannaz images are eye catching their ads are technically correct they understand the advertisers goals they deliver on time and on budget
9324870 think im walking stiffly yeah theres a 120 pound actress on my back
9324871 parental alienation is about people who narcissistically project their whole reality onto a child i dont need you so the child doesnt need you the goal of the alienating parent is to kill contiguous time people need reliability they need regularity and ive been the victim of a campaign to kill all that you wind up being more an uncle than a father
9324872 i said youve got to come over here and look at this
9324873 we will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes
9324874 the government has taken over all boats in the area
9324875 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9324876 people have been trapped for days living on the roofs of the concrete buildings in the villages while mud and thatch huts were swept away
9324877 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9324878 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia
9324879 it will be entirely a market operation because a is acquiring the shares alitalia has declared insolvent

9324896 what can be known must be validated with scientific objectivity
9324897 faith was found by an individual in connection to the church
9324898 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
9324899 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
9324900 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
9324901 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
9324902 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
9324903 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
9324904 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
9324905 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
9324906 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
9324907 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
9324908 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
9324909 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
9324910 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
9324911 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
9324912 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
9324913 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
9324914 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
9324915 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
9324916 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
9324917 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
9324918 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
9324919 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
9324920 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
9324921 i have told schuster and pedja that i want to leave the club
9324922 the coach thinks that he can have me back but i am only thinking about playing for chelsea
9324923 my agent has gone to the club a thousand times to speak to them and the club has not shown any interest in keeping me
9324924 now that the club have failed to sign anyone else suddenly they want me to stay
9324925 schuster is not my father he is only my coach

9324940 saya cenderung setuju dengan teman teman nu di australia yang merujuk ke institusi islam setempat dalam penetapan awal dan akhir ramadhan
9324941 tapi berdasarkan hasil rapat yang dipimpin wapres diputuskan bahwa sesuai dengan penjelasan pp 21 tahun 2004 anggaran pendidikan juga harus membiayai kegiatan yang mendukung fungsi pendidikan
9324942 pendidikan kedinasan kan seperti sekolah militer stpdn sekolah tinggi pemerintahan dalam negeri dan stia lan sekolah tinggi ilmu administrasi lembaga administrasi negara jadi tambahan itu bukan untuk kenaikan gaji pegawai depdiknas dan depag saja

9324944 bahkan pada memasuki bulan ramadan saat ini biasanya kebutuhan mereka cukup tinggi kalau mitan tidak tersedia dikhawatirkan terjadi gejolak
9324945 kami berupaya untuk mengatisipasi terjadinya gejolak di masyarakat jika terjadi kelangkaan mitan pada bulan puasa ini
9324946 kami menyayangkan jika pertamina tetap mengurangi pasokan pada bulan ramadan ini karena kebutuhan mitan di klaten masih tinggi
9324947 kami belum bisa memberi keterangan secara rinci dari satuan kerja perangkat daerah skpd mana saja

9324951 pergantian susunan kepemilikan saham di pt kma jelas jelas melanggar peraturan karena itu izin prinsip itu harus dikembalikan kepada negara

9324955 hari ini ita lebih leluasa di jalan raya karena kendaraan bermotor berkurang tidak seperti biasanya kepadatan arus lalulintas di banda aceh cukup padat
9324956 artinya dua hari itu merupakan libur bagi pegawai negeri sipil pns dan pegawai swasta sehingga mereka gunakan kesempatan untuk pulang kampung merayakan meugang bersama orangtua serta sanak saudaranya
9324957 akibatnya sebagian desa desa yang dihuni perantau baik pegawai siswa dan mahasiswa kini menjadi sepi karena pemiliknya mudik menjelang puasa ramadhan
9324958 panen raya kali ini dilakukan hampir di seluruh areal semangka di kecamatan sekaran yang mencapai 350 hektar hasil panen mereka diperkirakan mencapai rp8 miliar

9324970 sie haben sich nat rlich nur in bertragenem sinne von den m glichkeiten des energiegesch fts und der weite des russischen marktes korrumpieren lassen
9324971 auch wenn die spd aus angst vor der linkspartei zum selbstmord bereit ist werden wir uns nicht auch noch als cdu von der linkspartei in unserem politischen verhalten bestimmen lassen
9324972 und nach 70 75 minuten ist dann endg ltig schluss
9324973 wir hatten gro e angst es war ein gro es zittern f r die ganze familie und unter dieser voraussetzung k nnen wir ihm nicht mehr erlauben fu ball zu spielen
9324974 mit der angst kann ich nicht leben wenn ich nach jedem spiel zittern muss ob er nach hause kommt
9324975 die saison ist lang wir haben drei torh ter und wir rechnen mit ihnen allen
9324976 hildebrand wird sich wohl einen anderen verein suchen m ssen
9324977 f r das lehrjahr 2003 2004 haben wir festgestellt dass bereits ein viertel der akademischen lehrkr fte aus israel in die usa abgewandert war
9324978 vor allem die immens h heren l hne f r forscher und wissenschaftler in amerika f hren dazu dass israels akademiker von hier weggehen
9324979 in israel werden in allen akademischen disziplinen die gleichen geh lter gezahlt egal ob man wirtschaftswissenschaftler oder philosoph ist in amerika kann ein wirtschaftsprofessor nach einigen jahren das achtfache als hierzulande verdienen
9324980 hinzu kommt eine veraltete institutionelle organisation bei der man verpasst hat sie einer sich ver ndernden realit t anzupassen
9324981 aber dieser trend ist r ckl ufig wenn man dem gef hrlichen brain drain
9324982 wir haben immer mit der gefahr gelebt die hat sich zwar nicht reduziert ist aber auch nicht gestiegen
9324983 wenn ich meine gesamte energie in die akademische forschung investieren k nnte anstatt mich nach nebenberuflichen einkommensquellen umschauen zu m ssen um mich und meine familie ber wasser zu halten w re ich eher heute als morgen wieder da

9324987 wir m ssen das jetzt mit anstand ber die b hne bringen anderenfalls sind wir drau en irgendwann ist schluss mehr machen die politiker und die freunde bayreuths nicht mit und mit recht kann ich nur sagen
9324988 zumindest gibt es ja sehr intensive signale dass dort dem alten herrn ein zugest ndnis gemacht worden ist um auch seinen r cktritt hinzubekommen

9324990 rosewill is the brand name associated with the reseller newegg com like costcos kirkland newegg uses rosewill to sell competition products at cheaper prices than the big names that they already sell because they dont have to play the middle man of reselling they are selling factory direct recently rosewill has put together their latest aftermarket gpu cooler the rcx v100 which we have for review today because companies like rosewill sell a wide variety of products they are not always associated with the best of quality especially in a market like cooling where companies have become extremely specialized many people wont trust a generic name like rosewill

9324992 das rennen war sehr schwer denn das safety car hat mir nicht unbedingt geholfen
9324993 nach dem re start war es nicht leicht wieder den vorsprung zu vergr ern mit mehr sprit an bord f hlte sich das auto auch anders an aber ich habe immer hart gepusht meine jungs haben mir verraten dass sich das as roma auto immer mehr n hert somit musste ich noch etwas mehr aus meinem auto herausholen ich bin gl cklich dar ber der erste sieger in dieser rennserie zu sein
9324994 it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society
9324995 my kids are home educated four have graduated two have completed traditional college programs and two are taking classes five including our daughter with special needs continue to study with me the truth is you could do it you can learn how to effectively teach your children the required subject matter but beyond that you teach them by example every day parents are their childrens best teachers
9324996 i know its critical to have panels behind where youre mixing but thats a non option
9324997 o presidente ramon calderon e predrag mijatovic diretor de esporte do real dizem que v o me deixar ir embora mas schuster n o porque ele prometeu me fazer sentir bem de novo no time se ele pensa assim problema dele eu n o quero ficar no real madrid
9324998 a situa o n o mudou nada continuam as negocia es sigo com a mesma id ia de sair do real madrid quero jogar no chelsea disse isso ao presidente diretores mijatovic e ao treinador o treinador ainda acredita que pode me recuperar mas minha cabe a est no chelsea
9324999 calderon disse que se houvesse uma boa oferta eles me liberariam o chelsea fez uma boa proposta para me contratar
9325000 the piano repertoire is vast and rachmaninov to me seems a waste of time
9325001 im normally very calm about these press conferences to give assurances to our citizens
9325002 but you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts out of new orleans this is the storm of the century
9325003 the other is implied us support its half a commodity story half a political story
9325004 it has pulled them out of the acute poverty they were in and the day to day humiliation of working for a landlord
9325005 all the negotiating teams are back nothing was achieved in the latest round of engagement in south africa to break the deadlock we remain where we were
9325006 i can confirm that we went to south africa for separate bilateral discussions with the facilitator
9325007 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9325008 mugabe is showing no respect for southern african development community sadc no respect for the dialogue
9325009 as far as we are concerned to the extent that the dialogue has not been concluded there is no legitimate government in zimbabwe so he should not go to the un and au posing as the president of zimbabwe we will be taking up this matter with these organisations un and au
9325010 where else do you have such an abundance of land
9325011 russia is very often perceived throughout the world as a major military power

9325040 we in this country are perilously close to the end the concluding event of a long line of corrections at gods hand will be nuclear destruction
9325041 its more of an online graphic novel possibly the first of its kind in an official way as its full page colour toned and will run for 65 pages
9325042 it was originally conceived as a strip but the guys at the mirror s syndication department looked at it and really liked the way it read but felt it lacked something extra for the re launch
9325043 so it was decided to vamp it up and ramp it up to the format you see online at the moment
9325044 we have re worked the characters giving them a more coherent background
9325045 cutting away 60 years of wolverine like back history and mixed up origin was no easy task but we managed to put something together in the graphic novel that we think will please old and new fans alike
9325046 youll notice that we have taken the stories back to the pre world war 2 time period
9325047 it was decided that this offers such a rich tapestry of possibilities where stories and simple adventure are concerned
9325048 we didnt want anyone to have to try too hard to read this one
9325049 hence its garth lite simply a re introduction to the character
9325050 what you wont have in this first story is the team of specialists and re worked support characters that graphic novel writer david seidel and i have worked out for the first print graphic novel because this story is all about re introducing the lynchpin character garth
9325051 the graphic novels will be more in depth have meatier stories and be much more team driven books
9325052 we have two follow on garth lite online graphic novels worked out and as long as we can get the digital footprints to show we are getting the hits then we will be able to get the character back in the garth in print
9325053 which will be released early next year which is looking amazing
9325054 were talking to games companies as well as animation and film studios as possible avenues for the characters
9325055 were also working on the possibility of printing the 65 pager in three parts in us comic book format and sending them to the boys out in afghanistan as a morale booster
9325056 david was brought on board to work on the first couple of graphic novels and other related projects that are surfacing
9325057 davids writing is exceptional he has a really good grasp of timing and just enough dark humour to be able to give the characters that depth that is needed for a more modern reader without killing the fun of setting it before world war 2
9325058 davids written some amazing scripts for radio tv and stage including
9325059 i will also possibly be doing a one off special with jim krueger a buddy of mine out in los angeles and im talking to other writers about the odd collaboration that might be possible should this book pick up pace as i think it will do
9325060 i could do with a good colourist as my fingers are worked to the bone
9325061 i plotted wrote drew coloured and lettered the online pages where i would normally bring in inkers or digital guys to support me i guess im a bit of a control freak with this project as its a bit of a labour of love with as much investment in blood sweat and tears as there was in finances
9325062 i have always loved the character even in its more convoluted days with weird stories and big breasted amazons
9325063 i first started talking to ken layson the editor of the mirror s cartoon pages about this in 2002
9325064 it was all a bit like a michael bendis comic plot when it came to getting this off the ground it took a lot of twists and turns but eventually after i moved on from a company that i had created due to artistic differences i found myself in a position to take on a new license and approached the
9325065 since then there have been a few hiccups and while we advertised a re launch in slated for december 2007 the legals were tied up and we had to put things back a bit until here we are with stage one of the garth re launch online
9325066 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9325067 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident

9325127 my view has changed i think that an ice free arctic as early as 2030 is not unreasonable
9325128 the point isnt to block content or ads the point is to put users in control of what theyre sharing
9325129 with ies market share will so many people activate that so that it could affect the revenue side of the industry
9325130 any content from anywhere that appears as third parties whether advertising or stock tickers or news feeds all appear as third parties and in theory their content could be blocked
9325131 and if youre blocking all third parties youre also going to block all analytic companies
9325132 youd be blocking the companies that do the auditing of ad delivery
9325133 in a world of well informed consumers who expect choice we all need to be thoughtful about how we conduct business
9325134 to me this really starts the conversation ie8 beta 2 starts us thinking about the expectations people should have about what they share and how
9325135 were right there with the rest of the crowd in that we think there is a lot of benefit in targeted ads we just believe consumers have the right to know its happening and to opt in

9325147 das war auch ein riesenerfolg das kann mir keiner mehr nehmen
9325148 ich war nie sicher ob ich da hinkommen w rde aber ich wusste dass ich das spiel habe es ist erstaunlich dass es so schnell geht
9325149 das ist zwei jahre her aber ich habe im hinterkopf dass ich gegen sie gewonnen habe

9325156 they would always ask me or other iraqis working here if they would go out to the city and buy food to prepare traditional iraqi meals
9325157 my uncle is a translator so we contacted a few people to see what kind of set up we would need what equipment and things like that and we got started
9325158 business is good we have been set up since aug 11 serving breakfast lunch and dinner however since we are always here we also feed soldiers when they come back from a mission and might have missed meal time instead of eating a meal ready to eat we will cook up something for them
9325159 for an iraqi if you sit down to talk it is always done over a cup of chai so we do the same here with our american friends
9325160 usually lunch here is just self serve sandwiches but coming here breaks up the monotony of meal times and whether i eat a falafel or have a burger and fries its nice to have an option for something different
9325161 i hope that one day i can go to america and open a restaurant that serves both iraqi and american meals and then i can serve customers both genuine iraqi food and american food and through food bring our two cultures closer together
9325162 its a good way to show them what we know works well and i hope it works well for them

9325167 it is important to help give the iraqi people an opportunity to better their community
9325168 when they do projects like this it gives them a sense of pride knowing it was their planning that went into it
9325169 you can see through the communitys hard work that progress is being made

9325266 until today gmg delaware has been content to await gmg new yorks funding of the deal and has not exercised its rights directly at this time however gmg delaware is not confident in gmg new yorks ability to finance the transaction gmg new york has denied gmg delaware any access to information concerning their alleged financing and the trustee has moved to terminate gmg new yorks rights to the acquisition
9325267 independent of gmg new york gmg delaware has obtained a solid funding commitment for the full purchase price and has shared its funding commitment with the trustee
9325268 we have every belief that gmg delaware can and will fund the acquisition if provided the opportunity by the trustee and with consent of the court and we feel that our original bid was misidentified in good faith we hope gmg new york raises the funds necessary to close the deal however in lieu of the trustees present position and without information from gmg new york gmg delaware has our own funds to close and are offering to purchase the assets for the same price if gmg new yorks rights are deemed terminated
9325269 gmg delaware is confident that it can complete the purchase and that its bid represents the best return to the creditors of the bankruptcy estate for the trustee

9325282 tampoco se escuchen las recomendaciones de la agencia valenciana de la energ a o del panel contra el cambio clim tico que se reuni justamente en nuestra ciudad el a o pasado
9325283 demuestra un cinismo escandaloso al acoger la cumbre contra el cambio clim tico hacerse la foto y llenar las calles de una campa a para animar a la ciudadan a a ahorrar energ a en sus casas
9325284 como consecuencia del incremento de los precios de la energ a a nivel internacional el coste de la iluminaci n de las calles de valencia este a o puede superar ampliamente los diez millones

9325286 s lo seis de cada 10 alumnos finalizan la eso en nuestra autonom a frente al 85 por ciento de asturias el 81 por ciento del pa s vasco o el 70 4 por ciento de media estatal
9325287 estos problemas cr nicos y estructurales se constatan con insuficiencias muy graves como la falta de colegios e institutos la insuficiencia de plazas para comedores escolares o la escasez de enfermeros y educadores en los centros de educaci n especial
9325288 el alumnado inmigrante superar el 85 por ciento del alumnado
9325289 nuevamente se produce una insuficiencia de colegios e institutos con lo que persistir n los barracones por la falta de previsi n y planificaci n en la construcci n de centros educativos
9325290 todav a quedan por construir centros educativos incluidos en el mapa escolar presentado por el ex presidente eduardo zaplana en 1996 como el benal a de alicante o el instituto de ense anza secundaria bovalar de castell en los que las aulas prefabricadas son algo cr nico
9325291 deficiente con sobrecostes continuos en las construcciones irregularidades y anomal as en las contrataciones opacidad en la informaci n y sobre todo endeudamiento insostenible
9325292 como consecuencia de esta falta de planificaci n se produce una superaci n de ratios tanto en infantil primaria con 25 alumnos por aula como en secundaria con 30 alumnos por aula
9325293 al igual que en el curso pasado aparecer n nuevas resoluciones de la conselleria de educaci n que permitan incrementar el n mero m ximo de alumnos por aula hasta un 10 por ciento
9325294 una escolarizaci n no equitativa ni equilibrada de alumnos inmigrantes
9325295 s lo tendr en cuenta una peque a parte de las m ltiples solicitudes
9325296 una vez m s constamos la falta de voluntad pol tica de la conselleria a la hora de afrontar la insuficiente oferta de plazas en el primer tramo de educaci n infantil de cero a tres a os
9325297 la comunitat s lo dispone de 33 escuelas infantiles las mismas que hace 15 a os
9325298 camps incumple sus promesas porque la legislatura pasada prometi crear 45 000 nuevas plazas y a fecha de hoy la realidad es que solamente el 11 7 por ciento de ni os de cero a tres a os asiste a una escuela p blica cuando en otras autonom as los ndices son claramente superiores como el 48 3 por ciento en el pa s vasco 32 por ciento en catalu a o 33 por ciento en madrid
9325299 mientras para este tramo educativo no hay suficiente presupuesto el conseller de educaci n alejandro font de mora destina 20 8 millones de euros de los presupuesto de la generalitat de 2008 para concertar con la privada el bachillerato un tramo que tampoco es obligatorio pero con la diferencia de que en la red p blica existen plazas m s que suficientes para cubrir la demanda
9325300 pero s lo 125 000 de la p blica el 28 por ciento del total
9325301 no poseen plantilla de enfermeros escolares y la dotaci n de educadores es insuficiente

9325340 based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded
9325341 like spoiled angry children they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave
9325342 a social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do
9325343 a political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent drive personal appeal and work ethic and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population as liberals do and a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over regulates and over taxes the nations citizens corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state as liberals do
9325344 the roots of liberalism and its associated madness can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind
9325345 when the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious
9325346 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
9325347 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
9325348 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
9325349 it is a message for the baathists to go on in their wrongdoings
9325350 this guy was doing his job perfectly hes served his country by all his efforts since 2003
9325351 yes shes a huge change no he isnt a candidate of change
9325352 shes somebody ive been watching since her name started floating
9325353 she is wildly popular in alaska shes pro life and conservative that plays well
9325354 she is a kind of valentine to the evangelical base of the party
9325355 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as a daughter of a science teacher
9325356 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9325357 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9325358 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9325359 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9325360 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9325361 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked
9325362 i woke up and my email was just going crazy
9325363 and then when it was announced it was like you couldnt breathe
9325364 its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9325365 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9325366 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9325367 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9325368 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9325369 my wife and i watched an msnbc special on her last night
9325370 my wife knew nothing about this woman but she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had
9325371 dozens of emails and the phones have been ringing off the hook
9325372 they were taunting me saying mccains going to disappoint you
9325373 boy what kind of prayers have you been saying for mccain
9325374 he went and chose a pentecostal for his running mate
9325375 finally we can get 100 behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9325376 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9325377 while barack obama wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9325378 every shooter every hunter every gun owner every competitor needs to understand that it is time to in the words of bruce willis cowboy the f
9325379 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9325380 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9325381 palin could play strong in the sporting states like michigan ohio and pennsylvania depending on how they use her
9325382 most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they dont know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene but among sportsmen authenticity counts and palins got that and then some
9325383 i can tell you that this pick tells millions in the base of the party that they can trust mccain more specifically that they can trust him with supreme court picks and other key appoitments
9325384 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9325385 one scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow the other re arranged his schedule and is flying in wednesday i got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the mccain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for mccain sans the candidate before the thursday deadline when mccain shifts to the public financing system i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grassroots like this
9325386 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9325387 the choice is to shore up the conservative pro drilling base
9325388 this is an aggressive on offense pick not a defensive pick
9325389 he floated the pro abortion running mate then there was his performance at the saddleback debate and then you had the lieberman headfake and now this
9325390 now that he has so thoroughly exceeded their expectations for his candidacy first with his stellar performance at the saddleback showdown now with his selection of his running mate social conservatives are finally putting on their cleats and getting on to the field
9325391 its really quite remarkable and something that no one would have guessed would happen even three months ago
9325392 some idiot in the pinko commie tax leech business group at the expense of
9325393 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
9325394 some idiot in the pinko commie tax leech business group at the expense of
9325395 i was just thinking hurricane gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9325396 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually hit new orleans on day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9325397 southern decadence a celebration of gay life perversion amp evil
9325398 damn i cant even begin to defend a loathsome agenda that would force girls and women to gestate unwanted pregnancies to term against their will thus imposing immense hardship upon millions of people and wrecking countless of their future opportunities so i guess id better rail against michael moore on other topics and hope that craig and the readers wont realize or remember what a complete idiot i am
9325399 now i know that not all pro lifers are like this at all but i for one would be a tad concerned about aligning myself with a group that attracted such loonies
9325400 a preliminary investigation has been launched into the death of m yevloyev
9325401 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia
9325402 it will be entirely a market operation because a is acquiring the shares alitalia has declared insolvent
9325403 men cant some clothes may give you pause like a group of t shirts printed with an angry teddy bear carrying a bat this young hip
9325404 our boss wears tight short shirts and black hose and tons of dark black eye liner and a lot of make up what about the managers having a professional dress code too wake up we got big problems with morale

9325406 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9325407 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9325408 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9325409 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9325410 these are guests from saudi arabia and theyre comparing local verses with some of the great arabic poets and discussing their merit
9325411 it seems to me that sen obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9325412 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself gov palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
9325413 several members of the media were seen cheering and clapping for
9325414 dozens of men and women wearing green media floor passes chanted along with the crowd
9325415 two members of the foreign press exchanged opportunities to take each others picture while wearing an obama hat and waving a flag
9325416 several others nearby screamed woo during some of obamas biggest applause lines
9325417 feeling most people get when they hear barack obamas speech
9325418 was outraged that the aps charles babington had written in his analysis of the speech just off the wire that obama had tried nothing new and that his speech was lacking in specifics
9325419 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
9325420 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
9325421 because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9325422 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9325423 he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy
9325424 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
9325425 a maverick with a record of reform picks a maverick with a record of reform with this pick john mccain is putting washington on notice theres a shake up coming
9325426 alaskans are frustrated because there is opposition in congress to developing our vast amount of natural resources
9325427 we want to contribute more to the rest of the united states we want to help secure the united states and help us get off this reliance on foreign sources of energy
9325428 she took on the republican party chairman gov frank murkowskis attorney general murkowskis daughter sen ted stevens son the north slope oil producers and finally murkowski himself
9325429 on unfolding events mccains palin nomination as i said to a neighbor last night at a bbq
9325430 the first black presidential nominee ever of a major party in history
9325431 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over we would have a serious problem if we took it to the parliament right now

9325434 a preliminary investigation has been launched into the death of m yevloyev
9325435 while police officers were attempting to transfer m yevloyev to an interior ministry office an incident occurred in which m yevloyev received a gunshot wound to the temple area
9325436 yes it is true people close to the opposition confirmed that to me i do not know any details
9325437 page now shows aggregated party and candidate spending totals and limits for either a party or an electoral event
9325438 section 377 which criminalises men who have sex with men
9325439 removal of section 377 will open floodgates of delinquent behaviour
9325440 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
9325441 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here
9325442 upon only a first and second look i d say you should read everything posted by voice of a native son
9325443 intelligentaindigena has great commentary and interesting links that will always make you leaving the site a little more wiser
9325444 an extraordinary blogger posting on news from around the world for issues dealing with oppression of any kind
9325445 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
9325446 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores
9325447 each schools fees are just whatever they feel like they can charge
9325448 the law says that schools are supposed to be free
9325449 the reality is that the money has to come from somewhere
9325450 we read every book we could find we called every printer and publisher we called existing magazines and were picking the brains of them
9325451 we know that in the end it will be worth it but were not worried about getting a paycheck now its just about supporting the magazine
9325452 we all started researching we all started hitting the internet
9325453 i said well nick thats a really good idea but youve never done a magazine before
9325454 worst possible case we throw a couple of copies of a magazine out its a good story
9325455 literally like if the redskins had just won the super bowl
9325456 people were high fiving giving each other hugs smiling from ear to ear it was euphoria
9325457 ive been arguing for a long time that john mccain would have to pick someone who would not just satisfy conservatives but send them running back to him
9325458 and with this selection john mccain hit it out of the park
9325459 even those of us who supported other candidates are four square behind john mccain
9325460 when i saw the e mail confirming palins selection i was like wow weve really got a complete ticket the democratic ticket is all about making history but our ticket is about leadership experience and making history so we sort of kill two birds with one stone
9325461 a lot of those 18 million clinton voters feel disenfranchised and betrayed
9325462 as people started talking about the new hurricane i was thinking this cant be happening again
9325463 we already lived through this i dont know if we can do this again

9325466 we are extremely pleased with student performance on this years sat and in particular with the number of seniors who took the college admission test

9325482 the singur issue has become a serious problem for every one but if nano rolls out from the tata motors factory at singur it will be highly beneficial for west bengal
9325483 the central government does not want to comment or interfere in the states matter the state government and the tatas will have to sort out the problems themselves all we can say is that let there be industrialisation at the same time increase food production
9325484 i support and welcome new technology but we must safeguard the interests of common people simultaneously

9325495 the results observed from this sub group analysis showed that antiplatelet therapy with prasugrel resulted in significantly greater reduction of cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes when compared to those who were treated with clopidogrel
9325496 these findings are interesting in view of previous studies that showed higher levels of platelet aggregation in insulin treated diabetes patients after dual antiplatelet therapy compared to diabetes patients not treated with insulin

9325504 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9325505 on this track gustav will be moving across the central gulf of mexico today sunday and make landfall on the northern gulf coast on monday
9325506 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet more than six meters above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the center of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9325507 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong

9325531 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9325532 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9325533 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9325534 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9325535 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9325536 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9325537 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions
9325538 based on an extensive review of our clinical trial data for neurontin we see no evidence to support the claim that neurontin causes an increased risk of suicide related events
9325539 even though a drug is identified as a drug for weight control or smoking cessation or asthma these drugs often also get into the brain so there is always the potential for having psychiatric side effects
9325540 but we dont have any unifying hypothesis as to why very different classes of drugs have psychiatric side effects
9325541 i cant see any reason why it should not be widely and regularly used during drug development
9325542 it has been validated and appears to be a technique that is not expensive
9325543 there is no compelling reason to think that more than a few are associated with suicidality
9325544 whether or not any of these drugs cause suicidal thoughts and behavior is the critical question we need to answer up to now we have not answered that
9325545 debunking false notions of risk is just as important to the public health as knowing about risks that exist

9325549 its hard to launch an iconic device like the iphone on a network that it is not yet fully deployed as they build these networks they will need to make more improvements or the complaints will persist both companies are accustomed to controlling all aspects of the delivery of its products it illustrates the culture clash when you create an environment where you share the responsibilities between them then you have problems
9325550 i get almost one a day its almost like hey quit spamming me
9325551 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9325552 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling however macs are a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
9325553 in the public domain the coolness factor matters once loyalty forms the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple

9325598 daddy is afraid of heights we cant go up there
9325599 no youre not my daddy i dont like you go away uh goodbye
9325600 okay honey come on were going up the needle come this way
9325601 this morning i had the spin and just wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance
9325602 but then it all changed and we were leading again but this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9325603 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but okay its a race and these things happen sometimes
9325604 i was really confident before whaanga coast that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9325605 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third
9325606 thats how it is now im not going to let this knock my confidence i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9325607 it was a long long left and i went in the wrong camber

9325614 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster

9325618 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9325619 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9325620 weve been quietly waiting for authorities to do the right thing and weve been ignored
9325621 to be sure i experimented on the kids but it was general stuff and not limited to economics
9325622 its almost a memoir a bunch of stories on how i approached parenting issues
9325623 she has base motivations most notably food and you can get her to do anything with the promise of food
9325624 incentives is the basis of economics getting the price right and doing a deal
9325625 i know its a bit controversial because a lot of people say the babys needs come first
9325626 but parents have needs too and that means getting a baby to understand crying doesnt get them everything
9325627 you might want all the kids to come to your party but its at a cost to the other 25 families
9325628 you see vehicles destroyed by rockets on the side of the road
9325629 the wreckage isnt there for long the army soon removes it to make it look as if they are still in control of the road but they are on the verge of losing it
9325630 if this motion got up it would narrow the options available for women
9325631 any abortion is to be regretted but women make that decision for good reason i dont want women making that decision based on economics
9325632 i will be voting against the motion i dont know if it will get up but in the last two senate votes on stem cell research and the ru486 debate the motions were rejected by the senate
9325633 whether i see ms jessen at parliament house will depend on space and time but i dont think she will want to see me
9325634 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9325635 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9325636 i have extended maternity leave a lot of other people dont have that and need to go back to work when their children are young because its a financial struggle to stay home
9325637 obviously every parent would try to find the best care
9325638 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9325639 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9325640 large amounts of research are coming in showing that particularly for children under two but also under three child care is generally likely to be harmful to them
9325641 but i think our economic situation has made things more difficult for families they struggle to keep one parent home
9325642 over 65 per cent of families have both parents working and for a lot of people its not about choice its because they have to
9325643 they both have to be earning money to pay off the mortgage
9325644 the underlying assumption is that parents can make a more valuable contribution to the economy if they leave their children with someone else and go out to work
9325645 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9325646 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
9325647 half the fucking albums that are out there are shit i dont download but at the same time i dont buy new music cause it all sucks okay theres a handful of bands that i buy but other than that i just buy old shit because old shit is good sorry
9325648 people wanna blame the decline of album sales on downloading i think its actually the record companies fault
9325649 i think its the quality of the product if record companies would stop giving any fucking mook on the street with a fringe a record deal or their own record label maybe you would sell more fucking albums dipshits
9325650 moreover these women are more likely to interact socially with women who are less inclined to breastfeed such as those who are younger less educated overweight obese or smokers
9325651 new mothers need support from their families communities and workplaces in order to breastfeed
9325652 they need baby friendly accredited maternity hospitals increased breastfeeding help in the community and paid maternity leave not simply another government campaign extolling the virtues of breastfeeding
9325653 general mckiernan wants to ensure that the numbers can be reconciled somehow so its important that theres cooperation
9325654 its very surprising that the numbers are so disparate we believe that this could be because of some taliban propaganda or misinformation
9325655 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weightloss and radical appearance change
9325656 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9325657 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial
9325658 about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9325659 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9325660 it really denies the uniqueness of who the indigenous people are and what their contribution to this country can be in their own right as if they have nothing to contribute except the absorption of the culture that the west has offered to us its a pretty damnable statement if thats the case
9325661 were not living normal lives were totally over represented in the social indicators were dying a lot younger we dont have the education opportunities people are living below the poverty line in many parts of australia it is not just those in northern australia who are battling to make ends meet
9325662 tuesdays cut of 25 per cent will make lending cheaper than a week ago but not cheaper than a year ago
9325663 but the cost of their funds has now eased and also there has been an increase in political and public pressure on them to cut their rates
9325664 i think that on top of tomorrows cut there will be a further cut in october november three next year and two more in 2010 provided inflation is on the decline
9325665 it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9325666 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9325667 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9325668 if you decide to stay you are on your own
9325669 im not sure weve seen anything like it this is the real deal this is not a test for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9325670 there are racers who throw in the towel pretty quick without broken arms with just a head cold
9325671 my boy wanted to achieve something with his life and this is what he achieved
9325672 i gave him the chance to go i wish i hadnt one day hed asked me for an i pod and i said no i wish i had said no to this too he was a nice affectionate boy i had a lovely time with him
9325673 whatever control he had he somehow managed to prevent it from being so much worse
9325674 he told me daddy ive done really well this is going to be my third or fourth solo flight and its not so difficult he was so confident how could he have made such a mistake i think the school perhaps didnt give him the right instructions
9325675 only when we know exactly what happened will we decide what to do we want a proper investigation
9325676 the clubs dealings with the family have been very sympathetic
9325677 we can start to get into the black and still be ahead
9325678 these are investments in the future so it doesnt necessarily mean pain
9325679 we can turn those investments around into profits and still be cleaning up our act
9325680 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia
9325681 it will be entirely a market operation because a private group is acquiring the shares alitalia has declared insolvent
9325682 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia
9325683 it will be entirely a market operation because a private group is acquiring the shares alitalia has declared insolvent

9325686 we can turn those investments around into profits and still be cleaning up our act
9325687 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9325688 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9325689 after that comment moore backed off a bit and did say he hoped nobody got hurt and he hoped everybody is taking cover however he failed to make note of the last hurricane to strike new orleans caused hurricane katrina in 2005 and the billions of dollars the storm cost taxpayers
9325690 moore also took the opportunity to take a dig at president george w bush and the presumptive republican presidential nominee sen john mccain
9325691 to be on the lookout for stock piles and caches of supplies that could be used by violent protestors at the up coming democratic national convention
9325692 past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying abandoned buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm fields to store their supplies
9325693 be alert for medium and large numbers of these items that seem out of place for its location this could indicate the stock piling of supplies to be used against first responders
9325694 can also be used to throw at first responders and interfere with and horses
9325695 violent protestors are using 1 1 2 inch to 2 inch self tapping screws to secure the handles on these shields
9325696 the screws have been secured to the shields to act as an assault weapon against the officers

9325706 the problem was that kennedys efforts werent producing the desired effect the klan was so entrenched and broad based that kennedy felt as if he were tossing pebbles at a giant and even if he could somehow damage the klan in atlanta the hundreds of other chapters around the country would go untouched
9325707 kennedy was supremely frustrated and out of this frustration was born a new strategy he had noticed one day a group of young boys playing some kind of spy game in which they exchanged silly secret passwords it reminded him of the klan wouldnt it be nice he thought to get the klans passwords and the rest of its secrets into the hands of all kids all across the country and their parents too what better way to defang a secret society than to make public its most secret information
9325708 kennedy turned to the most powerful mass medium of his day radio he began feeding klan reports to the journalist drew pearson whose washington merry go round program was heard by millions of adults every day and to the producers of the adventures of superman show which reached millions of children each night he told them about mr ayak and mr akai and he passed along overheated passages from the klan bible which was called the kloran
9325709 i have to talk frankly at these meetings but i feel i might as well call drew pearson before i come to the meeting and give him the information for the next day he gives it out to everybody from coast to coast

9325756 the new training methods have paid off i was much quicker than in the first meeting
9325757 he moved and used his left jab well before getting a little tired towards the end ruiz was a tough opponent but nikolai beat him clearly
9325758 it was our goal not to fight ruiz but to box him and niko did just that i am very pleased with his performance
9325759 thanks to his training i have become quicker and more mobile that was key to success tonight
9325760 i am very sad about the outcome but i want to thank the german fans and the german people for their support
9325761 i hope to come back one day for pleasure not for business
9325762 nikolai is improving tremendously he was great with his jab and the one two punches i think he is going to be the world s best fighter he has a great trainer and keeps getting better i am sure he will unify the titles

9325767 it is unlikely the president will travel to minnesota on monday
9325768 i think what he learned from the 2000 primary was to fight back and not take anything for granted
9325769 thats why when obama said that john would use that obama doesnt look like the other presidents on dollar bills and that he had a funny last name that john didnt let that go unaddressed
9325770 i find myself surprised by some of the tactics that ive seen in the last few weeks
9325771 they dont seem like the tactics of the john mccain i know
9325772 i responded by getting angry on the stump and running negative ads about my opponent that only raised the toxic level of the primary
9325773 we should have refuted the above the radar attacks in our own ads challenged bushs positions and in my speeches stuck to the message of reform and patriotism
9325774 i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land
9325775 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
9325776 mccain coming in to some of those districts in the weekend before the election was the margin of error largely allowing us to keep the house of representatives
9325777 in marginal seats this wasnt a hard right guy he was the acceptable guy this wasnt bush mccain was the good housekeeping seal of approval
9325778 hes a soldier this is a guy who was beaten up for years at a pow camp and was one of the first lawmakers to call for the recognition of vietnam
9325779 he can get angry but he gets over it and at the end of the day he reconciles just as he did with the vietnamese and bush
9325780 i think a lot of his actions in 2001 to 2003 when he was actively opposing the president were rooted in south carolina
9325781 he shoved campaign finance down the presidents throat and he opposed the tax cuts
9325782 they needed each other bush needed mccain and his great appeal among moderate voters and mccain needed to show conservatives that he was doing everything to get bush re elected
9325783 i thought he was a lot more naive in 2000 he had kind of a cotton candy and ice cream campaign
9325784 in 2008 he was much more willing to go after his rivals romney and rudy giuliani hes learned to be a tougher campaigner

9325841 this is a very exciting development for the sunday school
9325842 we have been searching for a way to bridge the divide between the kids age 4 through 12 and the mature members of the church who have a wealth of knowledge and life experience to share but who may not want to teach a regular session usually out of shyness mentoring the sunday school offers a unique and invaluable opportunity
9325843 each month we will ask someone to speak to the specific theme were exploring
9325844 blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted
9325845 this helps to put real flesh and blood on the spiritual principles

9325859 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9325860 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9325861 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9325862 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9325863 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9325864 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9325865 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9325866 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9325867 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9325868 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9325869 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9325870 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9325871 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9325872 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9325873 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9325874 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9325875 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9325876 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9325877 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9325878 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9325879 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9325880 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9325881 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9325882 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9325883 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9325884 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9325885 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9325886 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9325887 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9325888 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9325889 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9325890 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9325891 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9325892 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9325893 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9325894 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9325895 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9325896 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9325897 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9325898 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9325899 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9325900 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9325901 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9325902 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9325903 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9325904 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9325905 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9325906 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9325907 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9325908 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9325909 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9325910 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9325911 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9325912 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9325913 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9325914 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9325915 no one works for someone we all just work together
9325916 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9325917 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9325918 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9325919 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9325920 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9325921 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9325922 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9325923 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9325924 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9325925 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9325926 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9325927 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9325928 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9325929 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9325930 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9325931 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9325932 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9325933 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9325934 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9325935 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9325936 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9325937 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9325938 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9325939 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9325940 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9325941 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9325942 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9325943 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9325944 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9325945 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9325946 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9325947 were trying to get it out as soon as possible because we know its important to people
9325948 it is unlikely the president will travel to minnesota on monday
9325949 high priced gasoline is here to stay i tell my people we are just at the beginning of a very big cycling boom
9325950 studies show that as many as 50 percent of donors to charities today will go to a web site first before making a gift
9325951 they may give offline but the web site is a powerful tool to help them make up their minds
9325952 i made a bet that if we exceeded 150 000 i would shave my head for a year
9325953 when we first started we had volunteers going door to door collecting a dollar at a time as other technologies developed weve leveraged them to take advantage of how americans behave and what is most convenient
9325954 its all about connecting the people that god has blessed with resources with the people in need
9325955 if we have someone on the ground in zimbabwe blogging about their day to day experiences we bring home the work overseas to here it makes it real
9325956 now more than ever before a charitys web site is its front door
9325957 this is a new platform for learning in the same way a laptop or a desktop was a new platform
9325958 the time is approaching when these little devices will be as much a part of education as a bookbag
9325959 are expecting a very high pickup of the iphone on their campuses
9325960 by the end the kids learn the balance of life
9325961 the educational segment is lagging behind the sophistication of the students
9325962 it breaches social and legal standards to get its way
9325963 flash forward 10 years and were kings of an empire
9325964 it was more that i named my character after my future son get your head around that one
9325965 we hadnt intended them to be alter egos but that isnt how things work
9325966 without understanding that we had done it we were essentially writing down our conversations on a weekly basis
9325967 basically the first day krahulik showed his portfolio and i complimented it weve been best friends ever since
9325968 we had so much fun making them we thought everyone should see these cool comics that we made so we shopped them around to various web sites back then it was still weird to have your own site it didnt really exist
9325969 you heard of click fraud we invented that we would click and click on them until it was 100
9325970 but when i had lunch with them i realized they had no idea what they were doing
9325971 so we said you know what lets do it ourselves
9325972 penny arcade is really polarizing you either really love it hate it
9325973 it already built a strong community so the expo was all about gathering those people into one physical place
9325974 you see people that dont treat gaming as a pastime but as a lifestyle you interact with people just like you and you walk away from a cultural experience
9325975 if i looked at a strip and was like why does this strip have so many more views i could go crazy
9325976 when you try to interpret that information you can come to a lot of wrong conclusions
9325977 penny arcade adventures on the rain slick precipice of darkness
9325978 were very insulated from that its rare that we go to conventions we go to comicon and pax thats the only time we see people responding to the comic
9325979 most of the time we dont have a sense of it we just try to make the best work that we can
9325980 if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
9325981 severe technical troubles poor contractor management and weak government oversight
9325982 i am very happy to come here and play in the premier league
9325983 players were complaining of feeling light headed and nauseous after training they d been together four days and couldnt believe how little theyd eaten most are used to diets packed with carbohydrates to keep going now all theyre allowed is a bit of cereal and toast
9325984 it got so bad that some started smuggling supplies of chocolate and crisps into their rooms behind capellos back
9325985 its not as if we are asking for any money for smertin
9325986 everything was relatively calm during the close season compared to the publicity at other clubs and now we just want to focus on winning games
9325987 there is a dialogue between the two owners on a regular basis and they have been supportive throughout the last six months especially in the transfer market
9325988 people forget that we have bought robbie keane and paid a huge fee for javier mascherano so the commitment has still been there they have been supportive through this transfer window and at the moment it is stable
9325989 we received a request from as monaco on saturday that they wanted to finalise terms with park in france
9325990 when you play chelsea and we only have 15 000 of our own there you have to ask does wigan deserve a football team
9325991 if people dont come they will lose a premier league team its so disappointing
9325992 we have built this club up bit by bit from the old fourth division but its just not a football town
9325993 we are the cheapest to watch in the premier league cheaper than some in the championship we are doing everything we can
9325994 het elkaar omhelzen liefkozen en om zich te hebben overgegeven aan onzedige daden
9325995 i want the liberal democrats to be the most effective campaigning political party in scotland
9325996 thats why i am determined that we break through the holyrood bubble and tackle the issues which matter to people in every part of scotland
9325997 to make that happen each of the spokespeople i have appointed has been given an additional priority area to focus on
9325998 these priorities reflect the issues which are facing ordinary people across scotland from shetland to stranraer i want the team campaigning across the country taking the lib dem message to the country
9325999 what if intervention causes a hurricane to damage another countrys territory

9326002 living in a tradition of stubborn egocentered practicality and geared entirely for the use and manipulation of everything we always pass from one thing to another from cause to effect from the first to the next and to the last and then back to the first
9326003 our task is not suddenly to burst out into the dazzle of utter unadulterated truth but laboriously to reshape an accurate and honest language that will permit communication between men women on all social levels instead of mutiplying a babel of esoteric and technical tongues which isolate men women in the specialities
9326004 programs had no effect on the sexual abstinence of youth
9326005 the findings provide no information on the effects programs might have if they were implemented for high school youth or began at earlier ages but served youth through high school
9326006 the number one determinant of whether a person will catch a sexually transmitted disease is the number of lifetime sexual partners we seem to go out of our way as a government and a nation to avoid telling people that but we hand out a lot of free condoms
9326007 only you can choose the right time for becoming sexually active
9326008 some people may choose to be sexually abstinent in certain circumstances a person who just broke up with someone might abstain from dating and sex play because being close to another person might not feel right yet
9326009 we need to take a more comprehensive approach lets encourage the students to refuse drugs and give clean syringes to those who are going to do it anyway for those who choose to drink and drive we should encourage the use of seat belts after all we need to be realistic

9326081 this government devotes to education i would say almost more than to any other subject not just in terms of resources which approach nis 30 billion in the 2009 budget but also in terms of thinking reforms and a different approach i would like to remind you that we are building 8 000 new classrooms 40 of them in the non jewish sector which is both unprecedented and unavoidable we committed ourselves to reducing the number of students in a classroom to 32 we are doing this spread over several years but we will do this as part of the reforms
9326082 a friendly city relationship is less formal than a sister city relationship and it generally has a lower profile it is likely to be a long term relationship but the level of community support and involvement is not as high as with a full sister city relationship

9326095 not everyone in patrol cars is trained to do high speed driving at the moment
9326096 they are either going to have to pay to train up everyone who might use a police vehicle or accept these speeding tickets and penalty points it will pose all kind of problems not least the admin required to identify who was behind the wheel and what level they were trained to
9326097 this is a huge issue forces have a major amount of work getting through the requirements of training officers

9326106 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
9326107 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
9326108 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
9326109 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
9326110 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
9326111 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
9326112 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
9326113 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
9326114 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
9326115 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
9326116 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
9326117 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
9326118 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
9326119 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
9326120 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
9326121 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
9326122 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
9326123 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
9326124 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
9326125 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
9326126 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
9326127 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
9326128 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
9326129 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
9326130 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
9326131 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
9326132 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
9326133 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
9326134 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
9326135 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
9326136 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
9326137 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
9326138 i was appalled at how flimsy the case is i was also appalled at the behaviour of many of those who helped produce the ipcc reports and by many of those who promote it
9326139 in particular i am referring to the arrogance the activities aimed at shutting down debate the outright fabrications the mindless defense of bogus science and the politicisation of the ipcc process and the science process itself

9326146 while the actress has always been blessed with full pouting lips it seemed as though the area around her mouth was more prominent than usual beart is the latest high profile woman to succomb to the trout pout
9326147 the main sign of an overdone lip is an alteration of the natural lip proportions the lower lip should be 1 5 times the size of the upper lip unfortunately many celebrities have over plumped their upper lips to make them larger than the lower lips this trout pout look works best in ducks as long as celebs keep the proportions of their upper lip to their lower lip to 1 1 5 they will likely look pretty natural
9326148 that is absurd to talk in those terms right now weve played one good football team and got a win on the road which is nice theres 11 games left
9326149 she marson wrote really good stuff havent seen her on zdnet lately though i read it less than before once the list is filled out start tracking staffing changes and look for correlations between microsoft advertising money or other similar influence and departure of the non shills
9326150 it would be interesting to track how that occurred and how reporters like marson were booted
9326151 i noticed that the editors seemed to fiddle especially with the titles frequently putting pro foss pro standards titles on microsoft puff pieces and negative titles on pro foss pro standards articles clever
9326152 for quite a few years i used to write to the authors and comment many seemed to act surprised about it so maybe they didnt always ask permission i suspect also that each victim has been given the impression that he she is isolated in their experience and kept down and obedient and quiet in that manner
9326153 but i figure there are some editors who do that more frequently and or consistently than others who might be considered more true to journalistic professionalism
9326154 the pre microsoft partnership version of the register used to be rather good about making attention getting titles without pandering to bills anti american anti uk party line
9326155 anyway the mislabeling of articles was enough of a chronic problem that i considered doing a survey but never got access to a proper database when i had time in my own bibliography i usually re wrote the title leaving the original in an annotation
9326156 never discourage anyone who continually makes progress no matter how slow
9326157 government house has been seized but it does not mean that the administrative power is seized too

9326170 the bottom line from this study is that australians think now is the time to adopt a climate change program that has some real teeth
9326171 they believe that climate change will cause serious problems in australia and elsewhere in the world and they understand there will be sizeable cost going along with it
9326172 the public clearly favours spending 20 per cent of the money on r amp d even though we told them that if they did that they would redistribute less money to the public
9326173 that shows the australians are very forward looking they see it as a long term problem and the r amp d efforts will help them get over the hump

9326177 many of the economic political and cultural challenges confronting the united states can be traced back to the dismantling of our industrial and manufacturing base
9326178 since the 1980s americas economic infrastructure has dramatically changed the evolution of our economy to service oriented businesses has seriously eroded the manufacturing capabilities and industrial capacity of our country this has produced a decline of higher wage paying jobs the disincentive to develop innovative manufacturing methods and practices deteriorating support infrastructure and the impairment of ancillary support businesses
9326179 its in the vital national interest for institutions representing business labor communities and government to cooperate to foster optimal conditions to incubate and develop sme manufactures the sme segment is the largest most vibrant sector of the us economy and by combining the entrepreneurial drive and creative energy of smes with the pressing need for innovative manufactures america can reestablish its ascendancy as a preeminent power in the global economy

9326182 the new radical islamic anti semitism that has spread and metastasized throughout the arab world in the decades since world war ii
9326183 the vast majority of muslims believe in a future of peace tolerance
9326184 the reaction has been everything from people who are upset with us and call us islamophobes to a gay jewish delegate whos seen obsession and told us the democrats arent taking radical islamic fundamentalists seriously
9326185 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
9326186 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university

9326197 it has taken a bit of the gloss off things
9326198 losing our club captain is massive for us weve played parts of the season without him so we have to push on
9326199 i feel so sorry for the guy when you think of what a legendary player he was to see him struggling like he is at the moment is heartbreaking
9326200 i will make the decision that is best for me and my family at the end of the year when i have had a chance to weigh up how my body feels and the offers from inside and outside the game
9326201 i dont fancy rugby union and im too old and too settled to go to australia but im certainly not putting all my eggs in the rugby league basket i have business interests and i know there will be life after i finish playing
9326202 the things scully has achieved in the game are second to none
9326203 back to back man of steel winner says it all hes been the best player in the competition for two years on the spin
9326204 its a shame that injuries have taken their toll on him but hes been a great player and a great person to have around the club the presence scully and keiron cunningham bring to our team is unbelievable
9326205 i dont know the full extent of the injury but id hate to think that anyone would look back on scullys career and just think about the number of injuries
9326206 hes been a fantastic servant for the game and for st helens hes been here 10 years and is such a great person to have on your side he has an aura and is a fantastic professional
9326207 whatever scully decides to do i know hell put 100 into it hes that type of guy who makes things work for him
9326208 as professionals you have to prepare yourself for things like that both physically and mentally
9326209 wait palin did i say palin i meant uh um
9326210 a nation which has forgotten its past can have no future

9326222 any sanctions would hurt the european union first of all much more than russia
9326223 russia is not has no intention to continue this confrontation
9326224 but if our partners would prefer to chose another option of course russia will reply will react
9326225 russia wants to be an equal partner but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse but of two equal individuals
9326226 so far we have seen no practical steps that would bear evidence to a cooling off i hope this wont happen because no matter what whatever is being said the truth is on our side
9326227 the situation is very difficult and we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending of course territorial integrity of georgia
9326228 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9326229 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9326230 the dangerous spiral of violence over georgia must be stopped
9326231 we need a strong and sensible european role to allow a return to reason and responsibility
9326232 someone should first tell me what a sanction against russia could be
9326233 particularly in such a serious political situation it is necessary to show a bit of common sense
9326234 with my mom working i either had to learn how to cook or eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

9326236 wine tastings and wine events are becoming popular at golf courses and other outside venues
9326237 we started the classes to give guests a chance to see the culinary side of mountain branch
9326238 we wanted to give people a chance to come here take a class and take what they learned home and try it
9326239 my main focus today is to teach you how to make these items at home on the grill in a timely fashion
9326240 it was three years before they let me touch a knife or turn on a grill
9326241 but i was passionate about cooking it was in my soul
9326242 my passion for cooking helped me realize a dream to be an executive chef
9326243 it takes most people 30 years to achieve that dream but i did it in 10 years
9326244 i like cooking these peppers like this because you can burn them and then use them
9326245 i learned some new ways to do things such as how to properly make a vinaigrette dressing and how to soak brine

9326265 rally new zealand last year produced the closest wrc finish in recent years and this year we have seen yet again an incredible twist on the final day
9326266 petter and phil did a solid job in what was a much more positive day for us their efforts were rewarded with a last minute leap to fourth position which goes some way to consoling what has overall been a tough weekend for the team
9326267 chris atkinson similarly upped his pace this morning which was encouraging and weve certainly learned a lot from the testing he has carried out over the last couple of days
9326268 its been a tough rally for us but fourth place is good after this weekend
9326269 what an incredible finish the whaanga stage was like a scrap yard today the car felt the best it has this weekend so we are definitely making steps in the right direction but its taking a little time of course we are here for winning though so we have some more steps to take but we have to lift our heads now and keep working so we can start to fight at the front
9326270 ok this weekend has been tough for us especially after our third position on the last gravel rally in finland
9326271 its disappointing that we had to retire today we were testing some suspension components and under braking the car slid straight on and we nosed into a bank and damaged the radiator so that was it now we have a little gap to look at what we can do ahead of spain
9326272 dont think you need government to take care of all needs and to make your decisions for you more government isnt the answer

9326276 the kind of a disadvantage of being an outsider is you dont know all the players the advantages are you get to start fresh you get to start with ideals and its worth it

9326287 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus

9326302 festival itu termasuk ajang seni pinggiran meski begitu kemasannya menarik dan terkonsep
9326303 nggak masalah buat saya yang penting saya bisa menitipkan karya hingga ke negeri orang
9326304 hubungan kami semakin dekat sejak surabaya dan perth menjalin sister city
9326305 kami saling bergiliran mengundang ketika festival seni surabaya dihelat kami juga mengundang seniman seniman australia
9326306 saya memilih menggelar pertunjukan di hutan jalan raya bahkan di kereta api
9326307 melihat kiprah saya banyak rekan seniman yang menyarankan agar saya membuat festival heri lentho
9326308 saya ingin kesenian ini dinikmati masyarakat luas mulai remaja hingga kaum lansia jangan sampai kesenian hanya dilihat seniman dan teman temannya
9326309 dengan begitu mata dunia pun lebih banyak melihat bahwa surabaya banyak menyimpan bakat bakat luar biasa
9326310 its a joke it isnt a matter of holy or unholy all months are holy if they want to end fighting it should be permanent
9326311 we want enforcement of sharia law and will continue our struggle we havent got instructions from our top leadership to stop fighting if they do order a halt then we certainly will
9326312 this action blunts one of mccains most telling campaign messages experience what does this appointment say about his arguments that experience is vital
9326313 our soldiers and airmen are staged and set to deploy to our coastal parishes without hesitation
9326314 engineer and communications teams are reporting to coastal parishes and are set to assist our citizens and local parish emergency responders our security forces are deploying to ensure safety and security of homes and personnel we are confident in our plans and ability to execute those plans on a moments notice
9326315 the primary function of these teams will be damage assessment
9326316 our soldiers and airmen are staged and set to deploy to our coastal parishes without hesitation
9326317 engineer and communications teams are reporting to coastal parishes and are set to assist our citizens and local parish emergency responders our security forces are deploying to ensure safety and security of homes and personnel we are confident in our plans and ability to execute those plans on a moments notice
9326318 the primary function of these teams will be damage assessment
9326319 obviously during that time frame the fight in sadr city was a very kinetic fight
9326320 with the threat of these areas being lower and the ground guys focusing more on nonlethal operations we of course conduct fewer lethal operations as well
9326321 if you look at the big picture the less we have to shoot and destroy targets or kill insurgents indicates that we are getting closer to mission success in iraq
9326322 the changing nature of our attack and reconnaissance missions reflects a greater level of security among the people a demonstrated capability of the iraqi police and army and a general improvement in the daily lives of the population
9326323 this would not be possible without the continued efforts of our ground partners to transition security to the iraqis and aid in the economic development of their areas these positive trends have allowed us to provide a greater degree of overwatch and a reduced level of direct action
9326324 because of the progress of the iraqis and their ability to handle their own internal affairs with minimal coalition support the decision was made to minimize our presence around karbala
9326325 it bolsters the iraqis confidence not only the iraqi security forces confidence but also the confidence of the iraqi population in the security forces ability to do its job
9326326 any responsibilities we can hand over to the iraqis that they can execute with a degree of success gets us closer to mission completion here
9326327 we are just entering the historically active part of hurricane season
9326328 although tropical storm fay did not produce damaging high speed winds that a category 3 or 4 hurricane would have the resulting flood waters required a significant state response that was a very good tune up for our emergency response team
9326329 the public got to see the national guard at work guard members and vehicles moving from armories to affected communities providing assistance to people in distress
9326330 we are able meet our mission requirements by preparing sufficient numbers of guardsmen to meet any anticipated weather event
9326331 we have a great deal of recent experience and know that when one weather event has passed we could have another on the horizon it is critical to our long term success to have enough capable people available who are also rested and motivated
9326332 the reason we do that is to be able to cooperate with state agencies and local authorities
9326333 the guard has continuous contact and coordination with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and our joint emergency operations center and planning cells ensure the capability to rapidly build up personnel and equipment if needed
9326334 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9326335 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on the top of big brown to beat the white sox right now hes on a roll

9326343 we remain cautiously optimistic that the dialogue is going to be successfully concluded
9326344 this is why we feel as mdc we have to be committed to the success of the dialogue
9326345 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9326346 of course the talks continue there isnt a timeframe and we are not going to be obliged to impose timeframes
9326347 for us the most important thing is that these talks must continue and we must find a solution its not a pr exercise we are not going to walk like beauty queens on a catwalk we have never done that its not in our nature
9326348 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9326349 there is nothing coming out of those discussions they are just wasting time they should just go public and say that the talks have collapsed

9326369 the book dealt with life at the bottom otto has never not for so much as a single day had any experience except that of life at the top
9326370 this provided the necessary conflict and i think made it workable as a film
9326371 i worked very hard to use as much of the book as i could as many of the people as much of the dialogue as many of the incidents as i could except that i turned them upside down
9326372 that people fall back into the habit in alarmingly high numbers because of mental unhappiness maybe it starts with the pace of the life we live with mature people taking sleeping pills and benzedrine then they go to more harmful poison
9326373 the great secret and special american guilt of owning nothing nothing at all in the one land where ownership and virtue are one
9326374 extraordinary behavior for a director or a producer almost all of them at this point would have begun the conversation by saying without even a hello on page eleven theres a misplaced comma on page fourteen i dont understand the motivation and so on and so on this is standard operating procedure and its meant to put the screenplay writer in his place in other words to put him down
9326375 mom think about it you cant take a man from his life and family and just dump him on a deserted road and leave him there
9326376 it has taken a bit of the gloss off things
9326377 losing our club captain is massive for us weve played parts of the season without him so we have to push on
9326378 i feel so sorry for the guy when you think of what a legendary player he was to see him struggling like he is at the moment is heartbreaking
9326379 i will make the decision that is best for me and my family at the end of the year when i have had a chance to weigh up how my body feels and the offers from inside and outside the game
9326380 i dont fancy rugby union and im too old and too settled to go to australia but im certainly not putting all my eggs in the rugby league basket i have business interests and i know there will be life after i finish playing
9326381 the things scully has achieved in the game are second to none
9326382 back to back man of steel winner says it all hes been the best player in the competition for two years on the spin
9326383 its a shame that injuries have taken their toll on him but hes been a great player and a great person to have around the club the presence scully and keiron cunningham bring to our team is unbelievable
9326384 i dont know the full extent of the injury but id hate to think that anyone would look back on scullys career and just think about the number of injuries
9326385 hes been a fantastic servant for the game and for st helens hes been here 10 years and is such a great person to have on your side he has an aura and is a fantastic professional
9326386 whatever scully decides to do i know hell put 100 into it hes that type of guy who makes things work for him
9326387 as professionals you have to prepare yourself for things like that both physically and mentally
9326388 mccain was scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech thursday but now may do so from the devastation zone if the storm hits the u s coast with the ferocity feared by forecasters
9326389 manchester city fc can confirm that argentinian defender pablo zabaleta has signed for the club today from espanyol for an undisclosed fee
9326390 we feel the addition of pablo is another great signing for manchester city
9326391 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9326392 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9326393 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9326394 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9326395 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9326396 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9326397 im normally very calm about these press conferences to give assurances to our citizens

9326402 no one has ever really loved me and certainly not my wife
9326403 these men arent looking for love they are looking for a distraction from who they really are

9326409 you arent that fat you are still very very lovely
9326410 xxxx is sooo pissed off at the world that she has to go to sites like this and bad mouth people
9326411 about some of these comments i understand that they are cause for your moral outrage against me they should be the cause for even more if they were in fact true
9326412 will the descendants of israel ever cease to be a nation before me
9326413 she had saved all off our cyber conversations printed them out and sent them to my wife whom i had already told my rabbi and even sent it to my boss she even sent it to my 80 year old parents two days later my moms heart problems got worse and she landed in the hospital what my mom ever did to her i will never know
9326414 as for me i have spent the last three years trying to ensure that i never again hurt my family and disappoint my friends i have been in counseling alone and with my beloved wife
9326415 what i didnt know was that the two were also online friends so on the ides of march three years ago the two of them figured out what was going on
9326416 she vicious emails to sites that carried my writing such as aish jewsweek and jwr
9326417 let me say this again what i did was wrong i also have learned what she did was wrong too although i suppose that she will never under stand that i can take the harassing emails etc but she goes after my family and friends once i came home from shul on shabbos and there was a scandalous letter in my mailbox and that of my neighbors it was put there by one of her friends who live in my area
9326418 after that my wife who is the real victim in this whole thing was afraid to talk to our neighbors for a good couple of months for over a year she would send emails and packages to my wife telling her what a sap she is for staying with me sending more porno etc i love my wife very much and i will go to my grave being sorry for what i did to her but my wife did nothing to this person there was no reason for her to spend two years tormenting my wife none
9326419 large amounts of money spent on lawyers and computer consultants writing letters to the web hosts of these porno sites and even a police warrant basically left me with the fact that there was nothing much that i could do
9326420 i changed my internet name because every time i would comment on a site or a site would pick up one of my stories one of this persons minions would a comment defaming my name and telling people to go to isnt
9326421 also it omits one very important point what you learn in dance school it took two to tango so i changed my internet name and location i became sammy benoit yidwithlid from nashville it was still me but i was trying to shield my wife from more torture
9326422 as for me i have spent the last three years trying to ensure that i never again hurt my family and disappoint my friends i have been in counseling alone and with my beloved wife we have learned to talk to each other and have grown closer than ever before she has forgiven but will never forget and i dont blame her
9326423 i have become more observant and spend more of my day in torah study trying to learn the right way to live my life i even got a laptop that sits on the kitchen table so my wife can open up and look anytime she wants i have worked hard at trying to rebuild the trust of my family and friends i know i can never fully regain it
9326424 why am i burdening you with this because about two weeks ago she tracked me down my site meter began to that she along with her friends have linked their pseudo porno site to my blog along with posting new crap on bulletin boards they send me harassing emails through anomysers but they are acting like terrorists if they truly believed in what they were doing they would have no fear of identifying themselves
9326425 i even got an anonymous email from one of her friends begging me to contact her it wont happen i wont talk to her or any of her friends first of all it would severely hurt my beloved wife i will not do that again almost as important is that i have been able to grow change and become a much better person i do not need to talk to people that continue to find ways to hurt me and my family i have moved on and have tried to grow they should too
9326426 loshen hora is not right when she does it and it wouldnt be right if i did it i will not even out her by name in this post our little blog community is very small the little harassment game that she and her minions have been playing is building again i am sure that you will begin to see more posts from her about me posts springing up that say i am a horrible creep i was although not anywhere near as bad as they claim i am sorry to have to bring this up to you but as my readers i thought you should know i promise that after this it will be back to regular content i am not going to run this time
9326427 over the last three years i have learned how powerful the love of family and friends is i came very close to losing them i will not destroy their trust ever again
9326428 the most powerful thing i learned was something that i had forgotten the fact that i married a wonderful woman with such a warm heart every morning when i go to minyan i thank g d that i was allowed to realize what i had while i still had it my change and development over the passed three years is due to her and the love we have for each other she was very hurt during the first few months but she has taken on my quest to become a better person our quest i couldnt have done it myself and through it sound like a corny line she does complete me if i spend the rest of my life running to do her every whim i could not even approach being as good to her as she has been to me
9326429 i used to be an actor i once had a director that had an interesting tradition before the opening curtain he would go up to each one of us fake spitting in our faces and give us a kick in the butt his reason was once we have been spit on and kicked in the butt there is nothing bad that can happen to you
9326430 as many of you know my wife was in the hospital for most of the month of january it looks like she may need additional and much more serious surgery right after passover
9326431 it was the losing of myself that caused me the most anguish i could feel it the brainwashing like a vampire and he claimed he didnt know anything was wrong didnt know what i meant when i said i was sad all the time and couldnt trust a word he said
9326432 part 2 you went into this with eyes wide open or did i
9326433 there is no observation and not a tremendous amount of facts like yours but a mountain of anger and that makes me very very sick to my stomach

9326449 this isnt necessarily a career ending injury but given that he probably was going to retire anyway given that he has been playing with this degenerative tear in the cartilage of his left knee for about a month knowing all the while it could tear more severely at any time and probably would eventually and that appears to be exactly what happened and

9326459 im just wondering what its going to be like with my kids riding 50 miles per week on the bus an hour earlier every day than theyre used to

9326461 the building was showing a lot of signs of wear and tear this will be a whole new look to the field house and i think its going to be very exciting
9326462 we made a list a few years ago and tried to wring out all the savings from that list as we could and now were going to see if we can generate some additional ideas
9326463 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9326464 discussions strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates he asked a lot of questions and listened didnt tip his hand to too many of us he was very insistent that this process often wounds people and we were to stay very quiet
9326465 what kind of husband would i be if i took the surprise of the answer to that question away from you
9326466 father why did you have to follow such a madman what is it you have taught me to do i have grown up hating the world around me all because of you i have spent so much of my life hating believe all the words you fed me and in the end where did it get me a full grown wizard orphaned by a man who believed he should be master of the world
9326467 and now youre gone youve been gone i dont know how to feel anything but hate thanks to you i dont know how to do anything but hurt no one wants to be around me and i cant even tell you how much i hate you and i do i hate you i really hate you
9326468 mother i dont think i ever told you but i do love you i did father never gave me the chance i was always supposed to be strong cold heartless showing love for him was showing weakness your devotion to him was your downfall as i watched that madman kill you but i loved you i hope you know that
9326469 theres something i need to do can i have some time to myself
9326470 i dont think i could stand to be here without you
9326471 all right then ill go and pick up some dinner for us and be back in time to eat
9326472 pansy i hope we can work things out i cant make any promises right now and i have a lot to sort out but i do hope youll be here to help me and maybe just maybe

9326474 i know i have done nothing to earn your trust or even your respect but i think professor mcgonagall might have contacted you and i do imagine that you still trust and respect her
9326475 i have spent an awful lot of time with draco these last few days i dont expect him to have changed overnight as a matter of fact he himself told me that it would take a long time for him to change and resolve the issues that war within his heart
9326476 i know you think hes cold and heartless but i assure you he does have a heart its buried deep within layers of cold and unfeeling flesh but it is there and i think i can draw it out
9326477 i know we might never be friends maybe some day we can but i dont really expect it but im fairly certain that draco will not be carrying out his vendetta against you
9326478 pansy i want to believe you mcgonagall said that you might be the key to getting him to stand down but how can i be sure
9326479 well i guess you really cant and i cant expect you to trust me but i can ask you to trust me i just watched draco return to his manor he didnt know i was there but i watched as he declared his hatred for his father and his love for his mother his ability to love is there and if i have anything to say about it he will direct that towards me i think i helped him realize that his hatred for you was misdirected i think he knows that no one else is responsible for the things the dark lord did its just going to take him some time
9326480 i really had no idea he said he had something he needed to do and asked me to give him a few hours i decided to come here i know you two are recently married and i thought some good news even from me might be welcome
9326481 pansy i am going to make every effort to believe you ginny and i have things to discuss as i imagine you and malfoy do i wish you luck with him i truly do i think you have a long road ahead of you softening his heart
9326482 and while it may take some time perhaps a friendship could be developed i mean to say its possible but i just dont know
9326483 ginny whats wrong this is good news why are you crying
9326484 she and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun
9326485 theyre trying to earn a buck in a fun way so theyre doing what they can to feed that demand and make money through my documentary ive realized how insignificant all that is because i know who i am take one part truth and 1 000 parts speculation and heresy and youve got yourself a tabloid story
9326486 i have a lot of respect for paris shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
9326487 the situation has not changed i want to leave real and play for chelsea i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there
9326488 since may i have been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to know because they were so sure of signing cristiano ronaldo now they havent signed anyone they dont want me to go
9326489 real president ramon calderon had said that if a good offer came they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort and i dont know what more i can do
9326490 i have told the president the sports director and the coach i want to go i wont refuse to play for real if i stay but if schuster wants to keep a player who is unhappy it is his responsibility
9326491 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9326492 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9326493 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9326494 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9326495 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9326496 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9326497 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9326498 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9326499 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9326500 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9326501 this is a low tech solution and could help all patients with cardiovascular problems
9326502 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones yo sigo con la misma idea de marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea se lo he dicho al presidente directivos mijatovic y al entrenador por en sima vez lo digo ante la prensa todav a el entrenador piensa que me puede recuperar pero mi cabeza est en el chelsea
9326503 schuster no es mi padre es mi entrenador no me va a obligar a hacer nada est mirando sus objetivos y yo el m o hasta ahora no ten a ning n problema con l el presidente y pedja mijatovic me dejan salir el club est de acuerdo conmigo pero schuster no porque se ha comprometido a recuperarme si piensa eso es problema suyo no quiero seguir en el real madrid
9326504 me ha molestado que desde mayo mi padre y mi representante hayan intentado renovar mi contrato pero el club pensaba fichar a cristiano ronaldo y no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme
9326505 no fue una ni dos ni tres veces las que mi representante y mi padre fueron al club a renovar han ido m s de mil veces y el club tampoco se interes mucho por mi permanencia no tengo nada contra cristiano me parece un excelente jugador pero tengo mi valor y mi orgullo ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar mi salida es un problema tengo mi orgullo y mi intenci n es salir
9326506 el club dijo que volvieran en septiembre cuando se cierran las negociaciones
9326507 antes pens que estar a diez a os pero no es posible y ahora tengo ganas de salir
9326508 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9326509 quiero aclarar las cosas porque me llaman pesetero y no saben lo que ha pasado verdaderamente llegu al presidente con una propuesta del chelsea me dijo que si la propuesta era buena me dejar a salir estaba seguro de fichar a otro jugador pero ahora como estamos al final y no han fichado a nadie no quieren dejarme salir
9326510 si tengo que estar una a o sin jugar lo estar me recuperar porque soy joven tengo 24 a os y es el destino
9326511 no me voy a negar tengo contrato si me hiciesen jugar lo har a aunque no estar contento
9326512 charles roussel knows he can hardly expect nanette vicknair to greet him with open arms after all not only did he abandon her twelve years ago but now hes the reason her home is in jeopardy still he desperately wants to fix things for her for them
9326513 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
9326514 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
9326515 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
9326516 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
9326517 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
9326518 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
9326519 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
9326520 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
9326521 das war wie ein kleines langstreckenrennen und gute werbung f r den motorsport
9326522 f r uns ging es darum mattias so viel wie nur m glich frei fahren zu lassen und auch am ende wo er wieder in einer guten position war konnte er wieder schnelle zeiten fahren

9326524 the american auto industry is deserving of government loan guarantees
9326525 gm must retool their plants but probably cant raise the cash needed to do so through tight private credit markets
9326526 give us cheap loans or we are not going to build new energy efficient cars
9326527 ever honest and vocal gm vice chairman bob lutz told reporters
9326528 dont say bailout proposals all the government is doing is underwriting the loan
9326529 retool ing their plants to only make new efficient cars like the volt
9326530 jamkesmas untuk orang miskin harus segera ditingkatkan menjadi untuk seluruh rakyat agar tidak ada lagi persoalan administrasi yang menghambat seperti saat ini
9326531 sekarang dana yang dialokasikan rp 4 6 triliun tinggal menambah rp 10 triliun supaya siapa saja bisa berobat gratis
9326532 ini sudah saya ajukan ke presiden tapi belum diiyakan karena sekarang pemerintah sedang ditagih rp 46 triliun untuk anggaran pendidikan
9326533 dengan jaminan ini maka rakyat tidak akan kuatir lagi jika sakit karena dalam kesulitan ekonomi apapun orang sakit pasti bisa mendapatkan pelayanan kesehatan tanpa mengeluarkan uang
9326534 kalau seluruh rakyat sudah dijaminkan maka tidak akan ada alasan untuk menghambat lagi semua rumah sakit tinggal melayani dan dibayar pemerintah
9326535 ya sudah ada keputusan ya presiden kita sudah menyatakan kenaikan mulai pukul 00 00 wib nanti
9326536 bbm akan diumumkan oleh menkominfo dan rencananya akan mengundang pimpinan media massa
9326537 de otro modo proceder por la v a legal como forma de desagravio ya que se trata de presentarme como un oportunista sin sentido de compromiso con mis posiciones pol ticas
9326538 su rostro reflejaba el dolor de quien ha perdido a su esposa y a sus hijos excepto uno un adolescente que pernoct fuera del humilde hogar
9326539 es aleccionador y nos debe hacer pensar en t rminos preventivos
9326540 entonces cuando eso ocurre el estado tiene que asumir la responsabilidad de ellos buscarle alojamientos darle educaci n y alimentaci n y ninguna instituci n puede tenerlos por m s de un a o porque la ley lo establece
9326541 weve wasted a lot of time a lot of money
9326542 winning the americas cup in my view is not only about money and numbers
9326543 im addicted to the team and the sport and the cup which inspires you just get addicted to it
9326544 this is obviously the last thing we wanted but having said that i think these are really important issues
9326545 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9326546 the eu is not in a position to throw russia out from anywhere
9326547 we agreed today that these countries will become members of nato
9326548 russias aim is to weaken georgia to the point that nato allies are scared instability brings regime change and the map of europe is changed by military force
9326549 its become a weimar like legend that we humiliated them
9326550 is it warmer in the summer or in the city
9326551 an extreme way of looking at our current workplace situation is that millions of people every day drag themselves to their cubicles at great cost to the individual organisation and environment so that they can send emails to the next cubicle
9326552 it is estimated that buildings contribute more than 30 per cent of global greenhouse emissions and yet they are one of our most underutilised assets
9326553 an increase of around 30 40 per cent in the utilisation of public transport roads and office buildings and an end to the crushing futility of the morning and evening peak hour rush
9326554 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
9326555 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
9326556 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
9326557 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
9326558 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
9326559 ill never hear the end of this from pedroia or ortiz pedroia says its long overdue and ortiz says hes retiring
9326560 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9326561 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9326562 i am seeing one hot piece of ass i could be the lesbian monica as a lesbian the hair on my arms is standing as would be my penis if god hadnt friggin screwed up and failed to give me one i have never been turned on by women politicians because they are usually boring ugly and have fat ankles palins nails would feel great digging into my ass

9326572 as they cool down the exclusion zone will be reduced in size
9326573 if youre focused on what you do and you are sort of an intellectual or a nerd that someone actually feeds you sort of keeps you focused on what you do
9326574 all the crusts for all these pizzas are made in house all made with organic flour
9326575 are they putting something in the food to make people apparently so happy to work here
9326576 when i got here i was floored by the number of perks
9326577 yeah when i dont come in i get a little creaky and have to come in to get a massage
9326578 well theyre certainly working but theyre also having a lot of fun
9326579 one of the things we believe is that you want to make an environment thats efficient for people so that in their personal lives they can live and enjoy and have a great time
9326580 and when theyre working they can focus on getting their work done
9326581 some of that is to keep people on campus and working
9326582 so some of this is if you do not have to drive anywhere to clean your car go out and do laundry or food you will be more productive in part because you will not be diverted by doing all these other things and partly because you will be at work
9326583 there are a lot of women i know who had to go back after six weeks and i think about that and my jaw drops i have heart palpitations and i feel incredibly lucky
9326584 prices started low and got high and now are more affordable
9326585 i thought of having to leave but they worked with the folks and reduced the price and now it is affordable again
9326586 well we sort of have a bit of a social engineering perspective on it
9326587 and we want them not so short that people dont have chances to interact but not so long that you waste time we try to think a lot about how do you create these interesting moments where people come up with great ideas
9326588 lots of organizations talk about giving power to frontline people and skilled people that they hire
9326589 we dont have a set time when people come in
9326590 if you come here at 9 00 in the morning the parking lots still half empty and its because its up to the individual and the teams they work with to figure out whats the best way for them to work together
9326591 ironically the hardest thing to copy at google is not the free food or massages or parking which anyone can do
9326592 the hardest thing to copy and for corporate leaders to get in their heads is that if you hire intelligent people you actually let them use their intelligence
9326593 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
9326594 raising these additional funds is a key element of our plan to drastically increase the presence of the company not only in europe but also in north america and asia

9326613 it is a totally rotten business but sometimes the only kind option for some animals is to put them to sleep forever it sounds lovely if youre naive we could become a no kill shelter immediately it means we wouldnt do as much work

9326619 sometimes these concerns real or perceived overpower the need to protect the community from evil criminal individuals for someone not to cooperate verges on a violation of law

9326629 except as otherwise provided in this rule evidence of the following is not admissible against the defendant who was a participant in the plea discussions any statement made in the course of proceedings under rule 11 of the vermont rules of criminal procedure
9326630 legislative history of the 1975 amendments to f r e 410 provides unusually clear guidance as to whether statements made in connection with plea proceedings were intended to be used for impeachment purposes t hat history shows that while crafting the 1975 amendments to f r e 410 congress debated whether statements made in the course of plea proceedings should be available for later admission to impeach a defendant the senate sought to specifically permit such use while the house opposed the exception the house view prevailed
9326631 this legislative history as conclusively demonstrative of congress intent to prohibit the use of statements falling under the general protection of f r e 410 for impeachment
9326632 a difference between the kind of uninterrupted 24 hour a day surveillance possible through use of a gps device which does not depend upon whether an officer could in fact have maintained visual contact over the tracking period and an officers use of binoculars or a flashlight to augment his or her senses
9326633 specifically i would reject the premise that information legitimately available through one means may be obtained through any other means without engaging in a search instead i would adopt the principle that a privacy interest is an interest in freedom from particular forms of scrutiny and would find that a ny device that enables the police quickly to locate a person or object anywhere day or night over a period of several days is a significant limitation on freedom from scrutiny and upon a persons reasonable expectation of privacy even if it occurs in a place where an expectation of privacy would not be considered reasonable under other circumstances stated otherwise while the citizens of this state may not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place at any particular moment they do have a reasonable expectation that their every move will not be continuously and indefinitely monitored by a technical device without their knowledge except where a warrant has been issued based on probable cause

9326652 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9326653 these measures will send a clear message to the world
9326654 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
9326655 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
9326656 these measures will send a clear message to the world
9326657 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters

9326659 my friend hooked me up with a friend and when i met her for our first date i couldnt believe she was single she was gorgeous
9326660 she immediately got snippy with our waitress there was a smudge on her fork and made a really big deal about getting one that wasnt already used over the course of dinner she sent back two glasses of wine before she found one pleasing enough to her palate and then loudly whispered a nasty joke about this heavy couple next to us sharing a dessert i suddenly realized why this beautiful woman was single that check could not have come fast enough
9326661 but i dont leave dirty dishes around or anything just a lot of clutter well i went out with a woman my co worker set me up with when we went back to my place for a drink she took one look at my apartment and gasped then she said how do you live like this in an instant this attractive woman morphed into my mom and i felt like a pissed off teenager i half heartedly offered an apology told her i was tired and offered her 20 for a cab
9326662 i met a woman through a friend who seemed cool
9326663 our offices were close so we decided to meet up for coffee on a friday afternoon after we sat down i made the mistake of asking how do you like your job she went off for fifteen minutes straight about how her boss was out to get her and her co workers were all a bunch of backstabbers i mean i felt bad for her but i wasnt even three sips into my latte before she started unloading i wondered if maybe she was the unstable one in that workplace
9326664 it was the third time we had gone out and at the end of the night she asked me if i wanted to go back to her place we had just started kissing in her room when we heard the front door open and a dude call out her name she froze in terror and i am not lying whispered for me to hide in the closet i was so confused and maybe a little buzzed that i actually got in her walk in closet i sat there for what seemed like forever listening to them fight from what i could tell they used to live together and broke up but obviously hadnt worked everything out yet the guy eventually left and i was not far behind him
9326665 it was only my second date with jane when i thought this could be it
9326666 and it wasnt because anything spectacular happened it was just the opposite
9326667 my buddy needed an extra player on his companys softball team so i filled in i got to talking to this cute girl on his team later at a bar huey lewis came on the radio and she started singing every single word to stuck with you i am such a closeted huey fan that i was like i have got to ask this girl out this second i did and weve been going out for a year now
9326668 on our first date lori and i took the subway
9326669 we were sitting side by side talking when suddenly she jumped up and told this older woman who was weighed down with shopping bags to take her seat i hadnt even noticed the woman of course i then gave lori my seat it was just a small gesture on her part but it showed what kind of person she was and that she was someone id be psyched to call my girlfriend
9326670 the second time i went out with beth we never actually made it out of my house
9326671 we had dinner reservations near my place so she came by to pick me up well before we could get out the door my dog got sick all over the kitchen floor she helped me clean it up but then he took a few steps and got sick again most people would have taken that as their cue to leave but beth stuck around while i talked to the vet and insisted on accompanying me to the emergency clinic it was so incredibly sweet my mutt pulled through and i knew i had lucked into something very special
9326672 saya melihat pidato ini secara keseluruhan lebih mengarah pada pidato politik daripada pidato kenegaraan
9326673 seperti pidato politiknya john howard di autralia bush junior dan tony blair ketika ingin mencalonkan diri kembali

9326675 jangan lupa bahwa anggaran kemiskinan itu adalah kompensasi kenaikan harga bbm kompensasi itu tidak lebih dari sepertiga dari dampak kenaikan bbm artinya pemerintah lebih banyak menarik dana dari masyarakat daripada kompensasi yang diberikannya

9326677 jangan sampai tingginya anggaran rapbn 2009 itu hanya merupakan bagian dari kampanye sby menjelang pemilu nanti

9326695 lebih dari ini jangan lagi kalian rusak islam ini jangan kalian memperkenalkan islam sebagai agama kekerasan dan hanya milik orang orang bodoh
9326696 siapa saja yang mengucapkan dua kalimat syahadat maka jiwa harta dan kehormatannya dilindungi
9326697 dan taatlah kepada allah dan rasul nya dan janganlah kamu berbantah bantahan yang menyebabkan kamu menjadi gentar dan hilang kekuatanmu
9326698 dan jika ada dua golongan dari orang orang mukmin berperang maka damaikanlah antara keduanya
9326699 allah menjanjikan bahwa musuh islam tidak akan dapat menguasai kaum muslimin bila ada masalah yang terjadi maka itu muncul dari perselisihan kaum muslimin sendiri
9326700 dan barang siapa yang membunuh seorang mukmin dengan sengaja maka balasannya ialah jahanam ia kekal di dalamnya dan allah murka kepadanya dan mengutuknya serta menyediakan azab yang besar baginya
9326701 ya tuhan kami ampunilah kami dan saudara saudara kami yang telah beriman lebih dahulu dari kami dan janganlah engkau membiarkan kedengkian dalam hati kami terhadap orang orang yang beriman ya tuhan kami sesungguhnya engkau maha penyantun lagi maha penyayang
9326702 in the glare of international attention it seems that even the government itself has acknowledged that this punishment was harsh and inappropriate
9326703 youd better come see me because im very old and sick
9326704 there amid those voluptuous splendors pilate already interested already feeling in this prisoner before him some nobleness which touched his roman nature asking him in pitying wonder art thou the king of the jews thou poor worn tear stained outcast in this hour of thy bitter need o pale lonely friendless wasted man in thy poor peasant garments with thy tied hands and the foul traces of the insults of thine enemies on thy face and on thy robes thou so unlike the fierce magnificent herod whom this multitude which thirsts for thy blood acknowledged as their sovereign art thou the king of the jews
9326705 doing unto others as we would they should do unto us
9326706 he ate drank laughed loved lived and liked life well
9326707 were you ready to die that you jumped into the stormy sea to save that childs life
9326708 thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands
9326709 the order of nature is ascertainable by our faculties to an extent which is practically unlimited and that our volition counts for something in the course of events
9326710 herbs have their heal ing stones their preciousness and stars their times
9326711 trim your sail and the same wave which drowns the bark is cleft by it and bears it along like its own foam a plume and a power
9326712 past all counting is the sum of happiness enjoyed if the millions who have in the last thirty three years escaped the pain that was inevitable in surgical operations pain made more terrible by apprehension more keen by close atten tion sometimes awful in a swift agony some times prolonged beyond even the most patient endurance and then renewed in memory and terrible in dreams this will never be felt again
9326713 have enlarged the field of useful surgery making many things easy which were difficult many safe which were perilous many practical which were nearly impossible
9326714 as we now put up with typhoid fever and sea sickness with local floods and droughts with waste of health and wealth in pollutions of rivers with hideous noises and foul smells
9326715 das ist eine gr enordnung die jedem weh tun w rde
9326716 er hat gesagt dass der brasilianische verband daf r aufkommen wird
9326717 der spieler ist durch den verband in den vertragsbruch getrieben worden
9326718 wir m ssen die bestimmungen des grundgesetzes so ndern dass wir den ausstieg aus der schuldenspirale dauerhaft schaffen
9326719 die wirtschaftliche lage in deutschland gibt keinen anlass dazu wir befinden uns nicht in einer rezession
9326720 wenn 1 4 milliarden chinesen dieselbe pkw dichte haben wollen wie nrw dann steigt der energiebedarf und damit die preise
9326721 a phone is only as good as the network its on
9326722 so much for a new way of doing business at the old at amp t your fathers phone company
9326723 its hard to launch an iconic device like the iphone on a network that it is not yet fully deployed as they build these networks they will need to make more improvements or the complaints will persist both companies are accustomed to controlling all aspects of the delivery of its products it illustrates the culture clash when you create an environment where you share the responsibilities between them then you have problems
9326724 i get almost one a day its almost like hey quit spamming me
9326725 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9326726 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling however macs are a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
9326727 in the public domain the coolness factor matters once loyalty forms the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
9326728 acho que um resultado para dar moral e confian a viemos de um empate em casa com o gr mio que l der e com um gol sofrido no final agora empatamos com o botafogo que a equipe que mais evoluiu nos dez ltimos jogos
9326729 dentro dos aflitos um bom jogo para a gente pontuar
9326730 thiago neves tem as mesmas qualidades de rafael van der vaart estou muito satisfeito com as contrata es
9326731 thiago neves tem as mesmas qualidades de rafael van der vaart o jogador certo para jogar com a n mero 10 estou muito satisfeito com as novas contrata es que nos tornar o mais fortes
9326732 antes de tudo era um momento para mim e estou muito satisfeito pois foi uma contrata o complicada
9326733 que apesar de saber perfeitamente a decis o do clube de n o negociar robinho continuaram as atua es e manifesta es chegando ao extremo de vender camisas do jogador atrav s de seu site oficial
9326734 a situa o n o mudou nada continuam as negocia es eu sigo com a mesma id ia de sair do real madrid quero jogar no chelsea disse isso ao presidente diretores mijatovic e ao treinador pela en sima vez digo imprensa o treinador ainda acredita que pode me recuperar mas minha cabe a est no chelsea
9326735 i was woken up at about 11 because i got a package
9326736 estamos no segundo turno j e as equipes j est o se conhecendo melhor
9326737 vamos tentar trabalhar para corrigir os nossos erros brilhamos aqui no barrad o contra equipes mais ofensivas que nos permitiam a chance de sair mais para o ataque mas contra o sport e o ipatinga n o tiv ssemos este espa o e o grupo estranhou
9326738 estamos no segundo turno j e as equipes j est o se conhecendo melhor a tv exp e as equipes o que bom mas contribui para isso e agora tentaremos encontrar subs dios para furar estes bloqueios

9326740 ein bisschen ein freak muss man schon sein wenn man f r t rkiyemspor arbeitet das ist schon ein besonderer verein die sozialen kulturen und strukturen hier sind schon anders als in einem normalen deutschen verein
9326741 denn wir kennen die kids vom nachbarfeld berhaupt nicht weil die nicht von unserem verein sind
9326742 ja es wird viel abverlangt aber auf der anderen seite ist das auch ganz gut weil wir in der regionalliga als underdog gelten
9326743 nat rlich will man bessere trainingsbedingungen haben aber es ist f r die psyche auch nicht so schlecht dass die spieler sehen wo wir stehen das kann man vielleicht auch auf das sportliche bertragen wir m ssen umso mehr zusammen halten und k mpfen
9326744 die unterschiede sind spannend weil je nachdem woher die spieler kommen haben sie nat rlich eine eigene mentalit t und eine andere art fu ball zu spielen es ist eine herausforderung es zu schaffen dass eine multi kulti truppe zusammenw chst
9326745 das besondere an t rkiyemspor ist das flair der mannschaft au erdem zeigen wir so dass immigrantenkinder sportlich auch was bewegen k nnen
9326746 wir sehen im hafenkonzept eine zusammenschau der norddeutschen h fen
9326747 ich w nschte mir dass zur kooperation bremen niedersachsen hamburg wieder dazu st t
9326748 die infrastruktur wird aus ffentlichen mitteln finanziert es ist immer so dass die suprastruktur privat finanziert wird
9326749 wirtschaft und politik werden sich diese chance in deutschland einen tiefwasserhafen bauen zu k nnen nicht entgehen lassen
9326750 wenn diese l nder gemeinsam mit bund und privaten investoren die finanzierung hinkriegen dann wird das unterst tzt
9326751 ich glaube dass ein solcher tiefwasserhafen f r die deutsche k ste dringend erforderlich ist weil wir uns darauf einstellen m ssen dass es zuk nftig andere schiffsgr en geben wird
9326752 wir sehen wilhelmshaven als ein angebot aus nationaler sicht und wir sehen wilhelmshaven als einen weiteren standort von eurogate
9326753 eurogate hat auch in hamburg einen standort und einen in bremerhaven und wir wissen aus erfahrung dass das geht und so glaube ich dass wir partner sein werden und nicht ruin se wettbewerber
9326754 why the fuck did you have the freshly cooked ham in the bathroom with you bitch
9326755 kill him kill kill you have to kill him you understand
9326756 make themselves like a man a woman like a man the punishment is kill kill them throw them from the highest place
9326757 this is not to tell you to start killing people
9326758 there must be a muslim leader when the muslim army becomes stronger when islam has grown enough
9326759 islam is keeping away from disbelief and from the disbelievers the people who disbelieve
9326760 loyalty is only to the muslim not to the kaffir disbeliever
9326761 its part of islam of the correct belief that you love those who love allah and that you hate those who hate allah
9326762 sister if me and my husband we cant go together what do i do if i want to go
9326763 you know that working in an environment that is not islamic working with the kuffaar all this takes you away from the religion and hardens your heart and it would be lying to you if i say its ok
9326764 you see muslims in every sphere of everyday life in this country i see muslims it breaks my heart when i see them working in banks short sleeves tight scarf like this make up being with the kuffaar all the time even speaking their language
9326765 we try to represent a variety of opinions through the products we sell in order to spread peace respect tolerance and understanding
9326766 si dec amos lo que bamos a hacer no nos votaba nadie
9326767 it seems pointless after 12 years i think people might think they want it but when they actually hear it i dont think theyll want it anymore thats our feeling about it at least slaughter of the soul was a very good album to end with as it would be very hard to top

9326778 she and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun
9326779 theyre trying to earn a buck in a fun way so theyre doing what they can to feed that demand and make money through my documentary ive realized how insignificant all that is because i know who i am take one part truth and 1 000 parts speculation and heresy and youve got yourself a tabloid story
9326780 i have a lot of respect for paris shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells

9326783 when we know our cultural history we can feel proud about who we are
9326784 there has been a real lack of sunshine this year it has been the dullest since the early part of the 20th century
9326785 we have only seen around 90 hours of sunshine the average for this time of year is 200
9326786 we are certain that one of the bodies is that of jill foster and the other is believed to be that of a man
9326787 the post mortem examination did show that jill died from a gunshot wound to the head further tests are needed to try and establish a cause of death for the other body
9326788 the two bodies were found close to one another and the body of another dog found nearby
9326789 three horses and three dogs found in the outhouses had also been shot
9326790 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9326791 concerns were raised for the safety of those in the building and the walls of the house had begun to lean in towards where search and forensic teams were working
9326792 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9326793 the message from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same
9326794 we have had a very good period of economic success which has for sure provided us with a very serious platform to weather these problems
9326795 both sides agreed to take action against militants insurgent outfits and their leaders on the basis of real time and actionable information to be exchanged between the nodal points
9326796 released prisoners of one country held in the prisons of the other country
9326797 we should be able to cooperate with each other beforehand even in the absence such arrangements
9326798 this is important because heart failure is a major public health problem even in well treated patients the mortality rate is 10 percent a year so new therapies and strategies are needed
9326799 i think it makes sense for doctors and their patients to consider using them
9326800 we are 90 to 100 per cent certain that cedric is resistant to the disease but as in all science we can never be completely definitive
9326801 while this development does not represent a cure it is one of the most significant scientific outcomes since the contagious cancer was first recorded on the northeast coast of tasmania 12 years ago and is direct result of the collaborative effort through the save the tasmanian devil program
9326802 from our latest findings we can conclude that it is possible to make some devils resistant to dftd by vaccination and we are hoping that as there is more genetic diversity in the west some devils will be naturally resistant

9326808 in the past two days we have seen numerous instances of police harassment and arrest of bushville campers on harriett island independent journalists and now the arrest on false pretenses of activists who have worked for over two years in the open to provide support for public dissent this week
9326809 were seeking sanctuary to call attention to the illegal tactics police violence harassment and mass arrests of the ramsey county sheriff who has ordered the politically motivated arrests of dedicated community activists on false pretenses to make it more difficult for ordinary people to express their dissent
9326810 were calling on mayor coleman chief harrington and other st paul councilmembers to join councilmember david thune in denouncing and calling for an end to the illegal tactics of sheriff bob fletcher and to affirm that the important work of creating supportive environments for dissent by all people that is the mission of the welcoming committee continue
9326811 theres a very long tradition of quakers giving protection to persecuted people so im completely in favor of my meeting giving sanctuary to those who are currently being persecuted by the ramsey county sheriffs office
9326812 ive always viewed the sheriff and the local police as people who are here to protect us and our civil rights

9326873 human rights commissions like generals are fighting the last war they do not see new threats until they are overwhelmed by them if out of generosity than for no other reason we should assume ignorance rather than wilful blindness then the remedy is education and training
9326874 you know shocked you know angry perplexed and vexed you know

9326880 go out and do what i already knew i wanted to do automobiles
9326881 bouncing around was normal you had to look for the opportunities where they were

9326890 i thought if tata motors sets up a factory in singur it will provide job opportunities to many engineers of the state and they wont have to go out but now it seems impossible
9326891 i thought i would apply for the nano project after gathering a couple of years experience at pune people from west bengal should come to pune and see how the city has prospered due to industrialisation
9326892 i thought the industrial image of the country particularly that of the state will change drastically with the start of the factory but with the recent developments it seems to be a distant dream
9326893 i thought my daughter can stay back in the state and work but with the changing scenario i am beginning to lose hope
9326894 these kids in the long run go out of the state and settle elsewhere had there been a project like tata in the state they could have tried to fetch a job to stay back
9326895 nobody wants farmers to suffer but at the same time industrialisation should not be affected if the tatas are allowed to set up a factory over there they will surely change the entire area for the better singur will find a place on the industrial map of india
9326896 largest and perhaps most successful experiment in authoritarianism in the world
9326897 what progress has been made in recent years what freedom the chinese people now enjoy has come only because individuals have demanded and fought for it and because the party has retreated in the face of such pressure
9326898 if you like china so much why do you criticize it so harshly
9326899 your money is being spent wisely and compassionately in tanzania and a lot of it has to do with the leadership of the president
9326900 i cannot confirm or comment on the issue as i am not aware of it
9326901 were the second largest state in the country were the state with the strongest economy in the country weve been the source of presidents and the source of significant members of the congress i expect us to be treated the way weve always been treated very well
9326902 this morning i had the spin and just wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance
9326903 but then it all changed and we were leading again but this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9326904 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but okay its a race and these things happen sometimes
9326905 i was really confident before whaanga coast that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9326906 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third
9326907 thats how it is now im not going to let this knock my confidence i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9326908 it was a long long left and i went in the wrong camber
9326909 when i pushed the car was spinning spinning spinning and i couldnt stop it i lost a lot of time
9326910 wir m ssen die bestimmungen des grundgesetzes so ndern dass wir den ausstieg aus der schuldenspirale dauerhaft schaffen

9326913 since the national cervical screening programme started in 1990 there has been a 50 percent reduction in deaths from cervical cancer but there are still about 160 cases diagnosed each year and 60 deaths
9326914 on average this means nearly three cases per year in wanganui and one death per year we expect the hpv vaccination programme will reduce these numbers
9326915 the vaccine only prevents hpv infection it does not treat infection so for best protection girls need to be vaccinated before they are likely to be exposed to hpv which means before they start having any sexual contact but it is still of benefit after sexual activity has started
9326916 the vaccine has a very good safety profile its produced in a manner very similar to hepatitis b vaccine and contains virus proteins but not the actual virus
9326917 it has been tested for safety in clinical trials on more than 20 000 girls and young women and its very effective at preventing hpv infection
9326918 a good investment in the future health of young women in our area
9326919 real positive move making the younger ones aware of what this disease is all about
9326920 in the long run what were trying to do is decrease the rates of cervical cancer making them aware of it now has got to be a good thing for when they get older
9326921 the ethical question is not whether it is right to vaccinate girls against a cancer that can be spread by sexual contact it is how best we can protect the lives of new zealands women
9326922 in fact medsafe fast tracked the registration of the vaccine for use in this country because the results of international clinical trials were so impressive

9326925 we have shown that n 3 pufa treatment is effective and safe in a large population of patients with heart failure of any cause who are receiving standard clinical care provided in hospitals and ambulatory facilities in italy since we invited all cardiology centres operating in italy to participate in the trial and most did so the results indicate what is likely to happen in the real world during the course of several years of polypharmacy care
9326926 these latest findings represent an important step forward in the treatment of patients suffering from heart failure with two million new cases of chf diagnosed each year worldwide the incidence of heart failure is increasing and it is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder in the us these results underline the potential of omacor in the treatment of life threatening cardiovascular diseases

9326939 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up

9326947 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9326948 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9326949 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9326950 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9326951 no no no i completely disagree and i know my husband does too she is heavily experienced in what she has done
9326952 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
9326953 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process

9326964 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
9326965 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
9326966 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them

9326973 were keeping a very close eye on what this hurricane is doing
9326974 if it looks like its going to hit we will obviously drastically change our plans this is not a time to celebrate
9326975 we are monitoring the storm and are moving forward with our scheduled program at this time
9326976 we understand that some participants may need to remain home to prepare their states for the approaching storm while we intend to gavel our convention to order on monday afternoon our convention places country first and ensuring the safety of our citizens is of paramount importance
9326977 because we know the government wont protect our house so we have to
9326978 this is going to be the storm of the century
9326979 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like this
9326980 i looked up at him and i kept looking up and kept looking up what was not to like
9326981 he was like a freak of nature and he intimidated people i mean he was frightening just to look at there was just one problem he couldnt fight
9326982 i am used to crowds supporting my opponents mostly because i am always boxing against people who are smaller than me
9326983 it is natural that the crowds support my opponent but i won this fight clearly and i feel like i am improving all the time

9326995 the response to catnip is characterized by sniffing then licking and chewing with head shaking followed by chin and cheek rubbing and then a headover roll and body rubbing 14 spontaneous vocalization occurs occasionally and has been interpreted as a response to hallucinations 1

9326998 we have no intention of being nationally competitive this year or ever
9326999 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9327000 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9327001 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9327002 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9327003 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9327004 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that

9327015 the original deadline for submission was august 29 but the new payroll reconciliation process introduced this year has needed substantial change from businesses

9327017 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9327018 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9327019 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9327020 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9327021 no no no i completely disagree and i know my husband does too she is heavily experienced in what she has done
9327022 its so insidious the way it turns your mind against you
9327023 its the closest i can imagine to hearing voices or being possessed it really does feel alien like something else is at work inside you
9327024 the most tragic consequence is the psychiatric spiral it causes
9327025 we know children of mothers with postpartum depression have more emotional problems as adults for instance they struggle to develop and sustain healthy relationships
9327026 new mothers are very sensitive to the idea they should be good mothers that their maternal function is paramount
9327027 when they perceive theyre failing in that role it creates both shame and a tendency to conceal it
9327028 the goal is to make postpartum depression a more mainstream conversation
9327029 thats the first step in getting women to realize they can do something about the problem
9327030 i would hope anyone who feels the way i did would see a doctor and if the doctor brushes her off she should find another
9327031 no one should have to deal with it themselves no one deserves to feel that way
9327032 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9327033 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9327034 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9327035 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9327036 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9327037 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9327038 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions
9327039 based on an extensive review of our clinical trial data for neurontin we see no evidence to support the claim that neurontin causes an increased risk of suicide related events
9327040 even though a drug is identified as a drug for weight control or smoking cessation or asthma these drugs often also get into the brain so there is always the potential for having psychiatric side effects
9327041 but we dont have any unifying hypothesis as to why very different classes of drugs have psychiatric side effects
9327042 i cant see any reason why it should not be widely and regularly used during drug development
9327043 it has been validated and appears to be a technique that is not expensive
9327044 there is no compelling reason to think that more than a few are associated with suicidality
9327045 whether or not any of these drugs cause suicidal thoughts and behavior is the critical question we need to answer up to now we have not answered that
9327046 debunking false notions of risk is just as important to the public health as knowing about risks that exist

9327050 victoria police has an attrition rate of less than 3 per cent one of the lowest in australia
9327051 retirements are always going to be there but when you get experienced people resigning in what is traditionally the middle of their service and the views that theyre expressing are those of frustration and disillusionment something isnt right
9327052 people might be lining up in their thousands to join the police force but once they get in there and see what its like its not like what they thought it was going to be
9327053 working in an under resourced environment for a decade or more is going to take its toll on anyone
9327054 members have had thousands of dollars spent on them by way of training in all manner of things and now theyre disillusioned and leaving for other jobs or considering their options
9327055 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the
9327056 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates
9327057 we will see what the reserve does but we will pass on as much as we can
9327058 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9327059 the overall market in 2008 is not very good and europe is even worse
9327060 we are seeing people are more sensitive to promotional deals but have not seen signs of consumers turning to third tier brands
9327061 were not planning to subsidize this exchange rate swing at all well either find ways of reducing the costs still further or we may have to adjust prices upwards
9327062 bank switching is a key part of having competition in the sector
9327063 i think we are making progress but there is certainly more to be done
9327064 its taken 42 years to get these cross citations and now we have to pay for them
9327065 its an issue of principle and that was the correct process
9327066 those blokes in canberra spend that on morning tea every day
9327067 there will be games every week in melbourne this year so victorians will love that but we still expect plenty of interstate visitors
9327068 absolutely its going to lift sales it is a very good outcome for retailers
9327069 this was an outstanding result considering the impact of the olympics which had an effect on three weeks of our year and our commitment to play matches in darwin carrara launceston and canberra
9327070 this morning i was supposed to be in brisbane but i am still in thailand
9327071 it was a beautiful holiday but now it has become a nightmare
9327072 i dont have any money i tried to pay for the hotel on my credit card but there was not enough money on it
9327073 i am trying to call my travel insurance but its difficult and the airport is still closed so i dont know when we can go home
9327074 all we can say is that at the height of the season there can be as many as 20 000 australians in phuket at one time
9327075 they have to drop you 20 minutes away from the airport so you have to walk with your luggage and then wait to find out if the planes are going
9327076 if you didnt know youd just think it was normal except for a few people talking on the street about it
9327077 im not fussed if they dont fly for another 48 hours id rather be stuck here than in bangkok
9327078 it hasnt been real good ive got one friend who came the other day who had to jump the fence to get out of the airport because all the people were barricading the gates
9327079 another mate cant get out hes due back at work but he cant get a flight
9327080 its diverted officers from the suburbs into the cbds safe streets taskforce it bungled the 2am lockout to the point of irrelevancy and now statistics indicate banning notices create more harm than good
9327081 there is no evidence to suggest that the banning notices have simply moved the problem on
9327082 anecdotally we are aware that the banning notice simply encourages friends to look out for one another and ensure they can get home safely
9327083 the jump in assaults on yarra streets is almost twice the spike the cbd suffered in 2006 07 that prompted victoria police to mobilise in the safe streets taskforce
9327084 it believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its personal computers consumer electronics and mobile communication devices including the hardware operating system several software applications and related services
9327085 competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures
9327086 could be negatively affected and have a materially adverse affect on its financial condition and operating results
9327087 believes decisions by customers to purchase the companys hardware products are often based on the availability of third party software applications and services
9327088 apples minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question its prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market

9327101 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9327102 the overall market in 2008 is not very good and europe is even worse
9327103 the situation has not changed at all the negotiations are continuing and i still wish to leave madrid i want to play for chelsea
9327104 the president and pedja mijatovic said they will let me leave but schuster doesnt because he has promised to make me feel comfortable again if he thinks that its his problem i dont want to stay at real madrid
9327105 calderon said that if a good offer came in they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort to sign me

9327109 what weve created is an integrated story that runs across all the platforms
9327110 what weve produced with the online component is not a marketing line in the budget its part of the delivery of scorched
9327111 perhaps what you can do is start to regard television as the advertisement for whats online rather than whats online as the advertisement for whats on television
9327112 its not like we end up with a frozen site theres still weeks and weeks of content that is set to roll out after the telemovie goes to air which continues to reveal the story and the aftermath of what happens after sydney burns down
9327113 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9327114 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9327115 he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites
9327116 so if the races of man are to survive it is ok for us to exterminate the lower races in order for the higher races to survive
9327117 im eliminating the competition in order for my offspring to survive might makes right but we are taught that this is wrong morals have always been taught to kids so we can eliminate this behavior out of them
9327118 grand master freemason albert pike was instrumental in the klan many could have gotten sucked into those troubled times what does this have to do with being anti communist my education post shows marxist influence on education are you defending marxism now
9327119 what does this have to do with being ant communist
9327120 apathy are you saying the new world order doesnt exist
9327121 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9327122 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism
9327123 what brings you to this forum you came directly to this thread and dogmaticly disregard any and all evidence for a global flood there is a mountain of evidence for the flood that even the blind can see the universal chalk layer polystrate fossils pillow lava on mtn tops non confomities within the geo column rappid petrification the numerous fraudulent dating methods used yet carbon dating shows coal is young which is disregarded billions of years do not exist neither millions
9327124 the only ones dogmatically clinging to this fairy tale of pagan evolution are either those in the education field for obvious reasons or pagans themselves freemasons knights kabalist all other witches or roman catholics who will not accept the bible including genesis which does not support their pope they often call themselves atheist and call catholics christian as if they are an expert on christianity for them accepting genesis would mean becoming a protestant excommunication and being disowned by their family a high price to pay for standing up for the truth the truth is a divider
9327125 none of your dating works you cant prove that the earth is millions of years old you guys cant even get 2 test to give the same result bet still stands perform your own tests
9327126 you dont have any if you did they would be paraded around not locked up in the basement of the smithsonian like the coelacanth lol
9327127 sorry not true their are always resistant strains they survive and breed they were already immune same as a killer flu virus it will kill off a lot of people but not all the people why some are just immune from it and will most likely pass that on to their offspring but its not guaranteed now if a virus turned into a moue that would be different now wouldnt it

9327129 thats nice johhny use a creationist that set up the chart by similarities wasnt darwin a creationist i believe so if by your reckoning of dna then were most closely related to the eggplant a chimp is higher on the evolutionary scale than we are and a fern is the highest evolved form of life on the planet nice one bj
9327130 wow do i really need to address this again one no where on earth can you find the geological column in its exact geological order and second you date the order by the fossils found in the layer at the same time you date those fossils by which layer they were found in third most of the time the younger layers are on the bottom and the older layers are on top like on the continental shelfs
9327131 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9327132 the more civilized so called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence looking to the world at no very distant date what an endless number of lower races has been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world
9327133 i think we must admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation i know that this is anathema to physicists as it is to me but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it
9327134 now this professor is an advocate of the theory of evolution
9327135 i believe that you can feel the religious overtones in that statement concerning the theory of evolution you can also see that someone who has preached it with the great zeal of thisman has had his entire comprehension of the universe altered it is more than a science to this man it is his religion it has permeated his entirepersonality under the guise of intelligence
9327136 has now come to realize that the possibility of a cell coming into existence by chance is impossible
9327137 if it comes to a choice between believing in a creator and believing in a scientific impossibility i will believe the impossibility
9327138 stupid statement he is saying that over the eons as the eyes have evolved from one creature to the next theeyes have remained the same but the genetic information producing the eyes have changed he is saying that mutations produced thesame results but with different combinations of genes thats utterly ridiculous but it is typical of the desperate measures taken by the evolutionist tobe able to hold on to his god the theory of evolution
9327139 if the theory of evolution is true we should see organs in the human body for instance that were useful to the human during his evolution but that since have become useless
9327140 there are about 180 organs in the human body listed by evolutionists as being in this category they included things such as the appendix the thymus gland and the big toe
9327141 guess what else is part of the auto immune system
9327142 the truth is there are no organs that do not have a purpose if evolution really happened we should see them
9327143 we should also see organs being born that is organs that seeing strange organs developing in our bodies organs that have no use at the present but that will have a use sometime in the future but we do not because there are none this is still another instance of the proclamation of assumed processes processes that have no proof of ever having happened
9327144 imagine the first amphibian as he started to evolve a wing at first it would be just a stub having evolved from a useful forearm in the midst of its evolution it would become a useless stub being halfway between a forearm and a wing it would have no function while evolving thus it places a severe handicap on the creature obviously natural selection would not allow such a thing to take place genetics certainly disallows it so there is no way with reasonable thought thatit could have happened
9327145 lucy has massive v shaped jaws in contrast to man
9327146 to complicate matters further some researchers believe that the afarensis sample lucy is really a mixture of two separate species the most convincing evidence for this is based on characteristics of the knee and elbow joints
9327147 johanson himself originally described the fossils as homo a species of man but soon after changed his mind based on the assessment of his colleague tim white they now describe the bones as too ape like in the jaws teeth and skull to be considered homo yet also sufficiently distinct from other later australopithecines to warrant their own species
9327148 the term falls outside the usual naming conventions for early humans and is used in a general sense to describe the oldest modern people in europe the skeletons showed the same high forehead upright posture and slender gracile skeleton as modern humans
9327149 dont you find that very strange for someone who was a keen supporter of the abolition of the christian led slave trade
9327150 sadly this has happened nothing of course to do with evolution nor with natural selection as i clearly demonstrated previously but more to do with
9327151 wasnt it white supremists who forced the native american into western ways by replacing his culture forever with the forced feeding of christianity and the english language
9327152 so yes i would say that instinctively we do have morals until organised religion comes along and arrogantly attempts top force its
9327153 try asking any jew who was part of or whose relation was part of the holocaust whether they blame it on darwins laws of evolution or whether they blame it on a white supremist christian nutcase if any answer the former i would be truly amazed
9327154 by the way i have two grown up children both absolutely wonderful citizens and wonderful people no religion whatsoever was rammed down their throats nor was atheism by the way and they are both non religious now religion is a totally redundant concept by the way talking of morals isnt it great that crimes such as rape and murder are plummeting there is hope for all yet
9327155 well we dont need religion for that but it is obviously not working too well when we witness the greed of the
9327156 i also detect a lot of hatred towards catholics on these pages
9327157 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9327158 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism

9327180 der doppelsieg von franck mailleux und jean karl vernay ist ein sehr sch ner erfolg in unserer noch kurzen geschichte in der formel 3 euroserie wir haben intensiv an der applikation des motors und der optimalen nutzung der einheitlichen reifen gearbeitet dazu kommt die sehr gute fahrzeug abstimmung von signature alles zusammen hat erm glicht dass wir ber das ganze wochenende hinweg konkurrenzf hig waren nicht nur mit dem sieg sondern auch mit der zweitschnellsten rundenzeit im rennen am sonntag haben wir bewiesen wie gut unser paket ist f r die kommenden rennen erwarte ich einen weiterhin engen titelkampf zwischen den teams signature und art sowie edoardo mortara und nico h lkenberg
9327181 ich freue mich riesig ber meinen ersten sieg mit volkswagen und signature die harte arbeit der ingenieure und mechaniker hat sich ausgezahlt schon am freitag war ich mir sicher dass wir hier ein gutes ergebnis einfahren k nnen das qualifying lief f r mich pers nlich nicht optimal aber ich konnte im ersten rennen die entscheidenden pl tze gut machen am sonntag gelang mir ein perfekter start und ich hatte danach ein tadelloses rennen
9327182 das war insgesamt ein sehr gutes wochenende im qualifying war mehr drin aber es ging hier extrem eng zu die beiden rennen liefen sehr gut f r mich im sonntagrennen erwischte franck einen etwas besseren start als ich und war auch anschlie end einen tick schneller dann habe ich mich darauf konzentriert platz zwei nach hause zu fahren ich hatte gro e blasen an den h nden und es war ziemlich schmerzhaft mein auto am limit zu bewegen
9327183 ich bin mit meinen beiden vierten pl tzen zufrieden im qualifying war ich vorne dabei hatte zwei perfekte starts und zwei gute rennen wir haben gezeigt dass mit uns weiterhin zu rechnen ist das wollen wir auch bei den kommenden rennen tun auf die ich mich voll konzentrieren werde abgerechnet wird erst am schluss
9327184 sie hat erkannt dass sich die dinge ge ndert haben und die autos sicherer geworden sind
9327185 in dieser hinsicht war er ein vorbild f r mich aber weit entfernt davon perfekt zu sein er konnte nicht verlieren das war das was er am meisten im leben hasste er wollte immer gewinnen sogar gegen mich und er tat alles daf r
9327186 und wenn er trotzdem wieder verlor sagte er trotzig dann nehme ich diese kurve hier beim n chsten mal eben vollgas das tat er auch und dann landete er im zaun
9327187 auf den aufnahmen in monaco kann man sehen dass ayrton eine stufe ber allen anderen fuhr er war immer der der am dichtesten an die mauern heranfuhr und am sp testen gebremst hat
9327188 das w rde auch in der heutigen formel 1 nicht mehr funktionieren es war damals eine v llig andere zeit was das rennfahren betrifft lag michael schumacher als vorbild f r mich sogar n her weil er ja bis vor kurzem noch in der modernen formel 1 fuhr
9327189 they tried to humiliate me and i was not going to be humiliated over this
9327190 if i was carrying nail clippers and forgot about them i wouldnt have gotten so upset but here i was just wearing my underwear

9327195 evidentemente la conducta de cada gobierno es lo que va a significar la forma en que estados unidos va a tratar a esos gobiernos
9327196 a trav s de la utilizaci n del poder econ mico que tiene por el petr leo
9327197 evidentemente la conducta de cada gobierno es lo que va a significar la forma en que estados unidos va a tratar a esos gobiernos
9327198 como hay un conocimiento por parte del senador mccain sobre las realidades del hemisferio por el continente americano sin duda eso va a conllevar a una relaci n m s estrecha con nuestros amigos como m xico como colombia como chile per los otros gobiernos muy amigos que tiene estados unidos
9327199 est consciente que tenemos enemigos en este hemisferio y esa es otra diferencia con el candidato dem crata a la presidencia barack obama
9327200 hay una diferencia entre rusia y georgia hay una diferencia entre ch vez y el presidente colombiano alvaro uribe mccain conoce esas diferencias obama evidentemente no
9327201 mccain est consciente de que ch vez es una amenaza para todo el hemisferio que ch vez est financiando elementos desestabilizadores a trav s de todo el hemisferio hay que contrarrestar los esfuerzos de ch vez por desestabilizar las democracias en el hemisferio a trav s de la utilizaci n del poder econ mico que tiene por el petr leo
9327202 gran parte del problema que tenemos con bolivia y con ecuador es esa utilizaci n por parte del se or ch vez de los recursos de venezuela para ir incrementando su influencia y su agenda antiamericana
9327203 es muy preocupante lo que estamos viendo en esos pa ses
9327204 habr a a n m s inter s por parte del presidente de estados unidos sobre el tema cubano sobre la necesidad de ayudar a la oposici n interna y a la sociedad civil
9327205 se mantendr a el enfoque sobre la necesidad de que se siga con la actual pol tica hasta que no haya una transici n democr tica en cuba encaminada a trav s de tres pasos
9327206 legalizaci n de todos los partidos la prensa y los sindicatos obreros
9327207 porque mccain considera que es irrespetuoso la forma en que el se or obama y el congreso dem crata han tratado a colombia
9327208 es irrespetuoso tratar a m xico dici ndole que ahora hay que renegociar el acuerdo de libre comercio con nuestro vecino m s cercano
9327209 adicionales a los programas que han existido eso conllevar a una mejor relaci n con el hemisferio
9327210 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9327211 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9327212 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9327213 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9327214 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9327215 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that
9327216 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9327217 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9327218 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does

9327242 we are excited about the work that big g has put into this song and our cause
9327243 leave it to my friend john to say you know its about time the republican party put a woman on the ticket
9327244 she knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries
9327245 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9327246 she stands up for whats right and doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9327247 i never really set out to be involved in public affairs
9327248 i was so excited when i first heard the rumors
9327249 john mccain chooses someone who is a mayor of a town of 7 000 people then was elected governor has been governor of a state for 18 months a governor of a state that has half the population of franklin county and yet she is going to be a heartbeat away from president
9327250 on the other hand in his first exercise of good judgment barack obama chose certainly hasnt helped him build good judgment
9327251 obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9327252 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country

9327291 what is new at least in terms of industrial implementation rather than prototyping about their proposed plant is the used of thermal energy storage as ive tried to point out on many occasions the problem with intermittent renewables isnt simply their cost its that their power production occurs only when the renewable resource is available which means you need some kind of backup when its not

9327305 it is obvious when one looks at the footage that yeager has captured you have to begin to not only suspect the fake paintings that are sold but also wonder about the responsibility of the press who only continued to promote the highwaymen shows with no real sense of accuracy of the authenticity of the art yeager delves into ft pierce looking for the highwaymen as he documents his earnest desire to paint with the highwaymen when he discovers livingston roberts at his home we see many of the artist gathered together including a rare scene with a staged but sincere reunion with jimmy stovall the artist talk on camera about the old days and yeager instead of choosing to edit the scenes lets the moments be so we can get a perspective of a times that have now passed livingston passed away several years ago and we see yeager and livingston painting together as yeager dreamed the day would happen there are precious moments where yeager tries to persuade rodney demps to paint again yeager discovers rodney wants a new truck so he purchases paints brushes massonite boards and recreates a scene that is reminiscent of alfred hair painting his art with a photo of a cadillac tacked up close by for his inspiration to make money yeager returns days later to discover the artist has disappeared and left the state yeager returns again and again to the neighborhood trying to make friends many are sceptical but it is livingston who senses billys true desire to become an artist and we as an audience watch as billy brings his guitars his first paintings and convinces livingston to let him paint yeager devoted a year to the project driving all the way from miami to ft pierce 5 days a week if one was to debate whether yeager is an expert or not and about the fakes and forgeries this footage will prove that yeager at least goes a bit further than just the surface and reveals there is so much more to the highwaymen than what is previously known

9327333 we could have held on but we did it for the benefit of the cows we just didnt want to put them through it the cows spent more time dealing with the salt in the water than producing milk
9327334 we managed to unify the railways shortly after federation but its taken us a century to do anything about water and its still extremely difficult because the water in those river systems is over allocated its a 130 allocation and that was in a good year
9327335 so when were facing a really serious water deficit there just isnt any water any more
9327336 we are now looking at a situation where we could either have an aral sea or a series of acid lakes the options we have shrink by the week because theres less water in the system look things are really grim

9327346 for us the most important thing is that these talks must continue and we must find a solution its not a pr exercise we are not going to walk like beauty queens on a catwalk we have never done that its not in our nature
9327347 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works

9327379 it should be noted however that the frequency with which security issues are reported does not reflect the frequency of their distribution in the wild
9327380 for example cross site scripting comprised roughly 23 percent of the total application vulnerability volume yet this vulnerability is very common in proprietary web applications

9327468 at one of the intermissions actually during one of those events they were saying how they were looking for females to get started so i was one of the few that went down and piqued my interest i actually took a fight two weeks after that
9327469 if you call having an older brother and a bunch of friends beating you up martial arts then yes i had experience
9327470 i didnt have any real training background which may not have been very smart or it could have been the smartest thing ive ever done because now its kind of what im doing for a living
9327471 i went to school at sonoma state where i just graduated
9327472 i played soccer there all four years i never had time to really make mma a priority because playing a college sport is kind of like a full time job anyways
9327473 but as soon as i graduated and finished soccer i found nor cal fighting alliance which is where i train now its kind of been history ever since i threw myself right into the mix i didnt waste any time
9327474 i just never had the time to actually get a fight and totally prepare for it but its not like i wasnt training or doing anything those three years like i went off to africa or anything to do nothing
9327475 im always active i was always training in some sort of way if it was soccer or anything i was always active i consider that i was off working out
9327476 the way that we train up there is unlike any other gym ive ever seen before
9327477 i basically have a gym full of coaches i dont have just one coach i learn from everybody in there dave terrell is actually the owner of the gym and my main coach he is the most knowledgeable person in jiu jitsu in the world if you ask me
9327478 its a three fight deal and its 18 months thats what i look forward to to know that im going to have three fights in the next year and a half
9327479 before it was always kind of up in the air maybe ill get a fight in a month but then it turns out to be three months and when youre trying to make that a full time career its an emotional rollercoaster basically
9327480 i train with all guys who sometimes are the same weight as me
9327481 but sometimes theyre 20 30 40 pounds heavier than me this is who im doing mma with sparring with grappling with i find myself pretty confident sometimes when i roll with another female
9327482 i havent grappled with too many girls except for in my fights and i did a jiu jitsu tournament last year that was the first time i had ever rolled with a girl
9327483 my goals are basically to beat every opponent that they put in front of me
9327484 thats what im going to train to do and thats my job to go and win

9327573 the obama campaign was caught flat footed by mccains choice and typically lashed out in a rant that once again insulted small town americans
9327574 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9327575 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9327576 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9327577 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9327578 i think that you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9327579 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time

9327609 i cant claim a bill clinton and say i never inhaled
9327610 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9327611 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9327612 senator mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a women on his ticket such as senator kay bailey hutchison or senator olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice

9327622 penny was such a friendly cat who was comfortable around people and animals which is why she probably made no attempt to get away
9327623 the pack of dogs was with a man in our back garden not only was he trespassing he was clearly hunting foxes with these dogs
9327624 im not bothered about the slap on the wrist he could get from the police or the courts i want the dogs owner to apologise to my grandchildren personally for the upset hes caused
9327625 its just nature isnt it ill buy you a new cat
9327626 it just added insult to injury it was a callous way to talk about a childs pet
9327627 this was despicable absolutely appalling the dogs shouldnt have been on the farm in the first place never mind hunting
9327628 you see suspicious people out with dogs and guns and all sorts and you know theyre probably hunting its terrible that a cat has been killed as a result of this

9327631 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9327632 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9327633 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9327634 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9327635 due to the hurricane the president is unlikely to travel to minnesota on monday we are working on alternate preparations and well provide details as soon as possible
9327636 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9327637 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day
9327638 im sure that if governor haley barbour thought senator mccain and governor palins presence would in any way distract from the important work theyre doing in advance of the storm he wouldnt have invited them
9327639 they need to know and i know they know they are in our prayers
9327640 we need to be sensitive to this as we go forward
9327641 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9327642 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up

9327662 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9327663 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9327664 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing

9327707 one of the mistakes i hope i learned not to make again in the preparation of this film is never never never start shooting without a complete script part of this was the fault of a very inadequate writer who was on at first and worked for several months and was unable to produce anything even remotely shootable this forced the studio into a five month postponement after which they told sam peckinpah to write it so he finally undertook it and did his best but we still werent ready when the second shooting date came up also we all had different films in mind the studios sams and mine i was very interested and remained interested in making a film about the american civil war it demonstrated the strength and flexibility of the union in that the united states could survive the bloody trauma for a variety of reasons this has never been successfully explored in a film as for the picture itself we shot entirely in mexico which gave it some saving virtues other than that the film in its current shape is terribly mutilated im not convinced that if sam had had the control he wanted over the final cut that he would have had a vastly better picture but it certainly would have been better than the film we have

9327710 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
9327711 and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
9327712 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
9327713 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
9327714 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
9327715 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
9327716 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization

9327910 hey the other guy brought five whats wrong with you
9327911 work with these talents ive given you or else ill tear you to pieces when i return
9327912 well you two sycophantic do gooders can increase the profits of that man who reaps where he doesnt sow but ive got better things to do
9327913 but dont forget that our master is coming back and he will expect some return on his investment

9327917 our new method of analysis has given us data that we dont intend to ignore
9327918 there will come a point at which we go forward with contracts even if they produce an overly conservative design
9327919 we will award contracts to meet that 2011 date and if we find out later that we can do with a less conservative design we can modify a contract in the field
9327920 weve got to get to the bottom of these issues starting with the seepage at the 17th street canal
9327921 university of california berkeley civil engineering professor bob bea says one thing the corps says another and we have an obligation to the public to find out whos right and whos wrong
9327922 if the challenges are valid the corps needs to address them and if theyre not they can be dismissed
9327923 we continually monitor test and watch and we havent seen anything to make us think that isnt the case
9327924 but i think its now valid to ask if there is a bigger issue and were doing that through the peer review process
9327925 the only way to keep that from happening there is to drive sheet piles so deep that the water cant seep into the adjacent levee and the corps didnt do that

9327930 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled

9327988 but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day no 15 will carry the mail for us in critical situations

9328003 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9328004 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america

9328027 i am immensely worried about the ultimate destiny of a lot of food manufacturers in this country
9328028 globally we are seeing the growth of the majors and unless we are able to build a food manufacturing business in australia that is sustainable then ultimately the global manufacturers will take the power base
9328029 my reading is that many of the smaller suppliers have been probably been squeezed out of the industry and that leads me to a concern over the next 10 or 15 years in that its a cycle that comes and goes
9328030 who knows in 10 or 15 years time there may be a handful of global manufacturers that win back that power base and thats a frightening thought
9328031 lets all go to one of this little side stages and this whole thing will look a little more professional
9328032 weve got a million dollar pa and a five dollar mic this is amateur hour

9328034 we saw the teaching of the gospel and the way it was presented at the church and the way its lived out through the people who attend the church
9328035 we asked ourselves and people asked us if we were crazy to move here to be part of a church
9328036 and we realized that for some people like it was for us it was the right thing to do but for others its not
9328037 the most important thing i saw was the churchs willingness to follow the scripture
9328038 so many churches are following the culture rather than the bible but im not a product of the church im a product of the gospel and thats what im here to live out
9328039 but weve also been asked to help establish churches all over the country by people who have seen what were doing here
9328040 were just wrapping up work in naples fla and weve been to dallas texas and hastings neb
9328041 the doctrine of grace the life of the spirit to the glory of god
9328042 i never like that idea because its culturally based its part of being seeker friendly

9328050 thought the law was unfair that the legally correct outcome was unfair that they were concerned about the consequences of a conviction to the defendant and or that they thought the penalty was too harsh

9328053 good commercial reasons why they would consider extending the agreement
9328054 what forestry tasmania are supposed to do is to get a commercial return so its very clear here that forestry tasmania are responsible for the wood supply agreement and thats the way it will be
9328055 they have an agreement with gunns for wood supply and that agreement will stay in place as long as it suits forestry tasmania
9328056 you cant claim that forestry tasmania is independent from government there are only two shares in that company and they are owned by cabinet ministers
9328057 david bartletts position has changed numerous times in relation to the pulp mill in recent times and i can only assume that some very heavy pressure has been brought to bear behind the scenes and that he has collapsed in a screaming heap because of that pressure

9328068 there has been a direct lack of communication with key groups and frankly we are amazed
9328069 to be honest we are concerned and surprised at this move it has all the elements of a shotgun wedding
9328070 we would like to see the university halt this decision and have them provide some decent arguments on why such a move would be positive
9328071 the status quo does not address the challenges and opportunities of the modern world
9328072 you cant imagine the university has rushed this but if they have you would hope they would go back and more consideration would be taken
9328073 there was great community involvement and we were thrilled with the reception
9328074 the games and events gave the crowd an opportunity to demonstrate their skills with an australian football

9328090 its been real slow going trying to get people to uproot their lives
9328091 that being said i think the project has still been tremendous these are the best freedom activists in the word that are coming here the moving aspect is a good screening process
9328092 the free state project appealed to us because it represented a real opportunity to work together with a high concentration of people who really valued freedom something that simply doesnt exist in california
9328093 they are forced to show their hand to show that they are the violent organization of men and women they really are or ignore us and hope we go away
9328094 if they ignore us we win if they arrest us we win
9328095 im really encouraged by the fact that at least were communicating and sharing ideas behind the scenes
9328096 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9328097 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9328098 it all depends upon what happens with these storms first things first and thats protecting the people of my state
9328099 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9328100 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9328101 no no no i completely disagree and i know my husband does too she is heavily experienced in what she has done
9328102 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes

9328112 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9328113 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9328114 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9328115 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9328116 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that

9328119 you see vehicles destroyed by rockets on the side of the road
9328120 the wreckage isnt there for long the army soon removes it to make it look as if they are still in control of the road but they are on the verge of losing it
9328121 if nato lost control of the pass there is no doubt that other routes would be found
9328122 but they are more difficult and expensive it would interfere with the smooth running of the operation

9328129 deze ontmoeting vind plaats in een tijd waarin de vloedgolf van kapitalistisch imperialisme de werkende klasse van het continent verdrukt die hun levensonderhoud wordt bedreigd en die hun de elementaire mensenrechten democratische economische medezeggenschap algemene tewerkwerkstelling en duurzaam levensonderhoud ontzegt en waarin de vrees voor staatsgrepen en militaire dictaturen elke ruimte voor democratische paricipatie bedreigd
9328130 wij stellen wat dat de meerderheid van de afrikaanse mensen onder n dollar per dag moet overleven terwijl er voor een europese koe zon 25 dollar per dag wordt voorzien europa heeft een onmiskenbare verantwoordelijkheid voor de verarming van het afrikaanse continent en zijn mensen tot op heden wil europa het continent aan zich binden door de economic partnership trade agreements en door landbouwsubsidies deze dienen om het continent te binden in een eeuwige economische afhankelijkheid van europese hulp
9328131 de communistische beweging de linkse beweging en de bevrijdingsbeweging die steeds meer gemarginaliseerd dreigt te worden neemt zich voor een proces op te starten dat de linkse beweging nieuw leven zal inblazen in elk aspect van het maatschappelijk leven in afrika de communisten en al de linkse krachten worden opgeroepen om zich aan de frontlinie te plaatsen in de strijd tegen de privatisering van overheidsbedrijven en het neoliberale beleid dat door veel afrikaase regeringen gevolgd wordt we herbevestigen de nood aan linkse eenheid en samenwerking tussen progressieve krachten om ervaringen uit te wisselen en progressieve solidariteit te bieden aa elkaar en samen het kapitalistische systeem te bestrijden
9328132 de amerikaanse imperialisme is terrein aan het winnen op het continent door de oprichting van het africa command om zijn grillen door te drukken en de afrikaanse grondstoffen verder te plunderen vooral dan olie en andere natuurlijke rijkdommen
9328133 zoals onder communistische voorgangers het stelden in het communistisch manifest er waart een spook door europa het spook van het communisme de afrikaanse burgerij weze gewaarschuwd dat het spook van het communisme dwaalt door afrika alle communisten worden opgeroepen naar de frontlinie om de klassetegenstellingen aan te scherpen en het continent vooruit te helpen naar het communisme afrika is klaar voor de strijd die een beslist en overtuigd links politiekleiderschap en organisatievorm vereist bemoedigd door de revolutionaire opmars in latijns amerika en de strijd van de arbeidersklasse op het afrikaanse continent blijven we geinspireerd door het sociaal revolutionaire succes van cuba en anderen we weten dat de communistische toekomst voor afrika verzekert is door hard werk en volharding in het opbouwen van de communistische organisatie

9328135 its impossible to say that this system is going to do this or that
9328136 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9328137 for a man who is 72 and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible
9328138 suddenly mccains age and health become central issues as does his judgment
9328139 she is going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9328140 i was once told you are the cat they are the rat and dont forget that
9328141 on one occasion i was stunned to see a tall young female guard kick a small boy aged about four because he was having fun near the compound gate
9328142 there was a man who sewed his lips if you met him you would be amazed that he would be driven to that because he worked with the un and had all his documents with him and they just totally ignored his documentation
9328143 his mother reported that on one occasion he obtained a piece of string and executed his truck
9328144 one of the most poignant moments i experienced was when a three year old curly haired child who could barely speak interrupted my conversation with his father with the words guards take my mummy
9328145 the worst thing i will never forget it was people cutting themselves
9328146 it was horrible i remember one time a person was harming himself up a tree and his children were crying under the tree his wife was crying and yelling under the tree his blood was dripping from the tree
9328147 children copy other people too many people go crazy inside people standing on the fences wanting to jump the children look at these people
9328148 there is no reason why anybody would overdose on shampoo unless they had learned that behaviour in detention centres it is isolated to that particular environment
9328149 on the night of 19 october 2001 353 people drowned as they tried to get to australia to be reunited with their immediate family members who had already been accepted in australia as refugees
9328150 my mind is jumping around because the only way i could survive that place was by not caring and not caring is not that easy
9328151 last year we were more anxious id say they are very hungry to achieve
9328152 i thought we were outstanding in the second third and fourth quarters it is exactly the sort of game you want coming in to the finals
9328153 weve been up for a few weeks now and then i just thought we looked pretty flat
9328154 this selection shows where mccain thinks the campaign was at that they faced the prospect of a wipeout in november
9328155 im just trying to see how serious the government is in its water purchase program
9328156 there is no compassion whatsoever from the federal government for the shop owners the fuel agents elders the chemical suppliers
9328157 any person who owns a house in coleambally because the houses will not be worth anything once this happens will get a lump sum
9328158 what is the community going to look like in 25 years time
9328159 water minister penny wong wants to go out and buy water i am offering 600 gigalitres billion litres of water for sale
9328160 buying water will not save the environment the only thing that is going to save the environment is rain
9328161 and concentrate on making the other areas work very very productively
9328162 more suitable for environmental flows in the lower part of the basin than buying up large entitlements in the northern part of the basin like cubbie station and toorale
9328163 hence the asking of a large premium price by rights it should be very attractive as the murrumbidgee is a reliable supply of water compared with the northern rivers
9328164 when they hear that 1 5million farms are going to be worth 4 million to them they say yes we will take the money
9328165 the government has made it clear that it is open to talking with any willing sellers of water entitlements in the basin provided any proposed offer is at a fair market price and has environmental benefits
9328166 for everyone thinking that they can ride this storm out mrnagin said
9328167 now that we have a big entourage sometimes we can be a distraction in those kinds of situations he said
9328168 last resort shelter as there was during katrina when thousands suffered inside the superdome
9328169 im not staying for them any more said lester harris a 53 year old electrician waiting at a bus pickup point he was rescued from his house by boat after katrina
9328170 im not too concerned about the numbers to be frank it hurts when you lose you can chase the statistics all you like
9328171 its not dissimilar to our performance in sydney 34 19 win against the all blacks someone mentioned statistically it was the best performance by the wallabies and yet the next week we were belted thats the way it is
9328172 i guess the only redeeming feature is that it is evident how much it took for us to lift the mandela silverware we achieved something and we have the opportunity to go on and achieve more
9328173 we will hang on to that obviously we wont be taking too much out of this other than the things we dropped off on
9328174 the springboks profited a lot from our inaccuracy without a doubt it was as much about what we did as anything
9328175 they played with a lot of confidence as you do when youve been suffering for a while and you start to get a roll on and you become very difficult to stop
9328176 we didnt help ourselves to that end most importantly it was what we did with the possession we had and obviously the defence dropped away
9328177 we had some possession early looked threatening didnt finish the reverse of last week in many ways it might have helped the mindset ours and theirs if we had scored early its done done and dusted
9328178 they kicked us a lot of ball and we kicked it back to them we didnt produce any pressure from that and with that lack of pressure they started to play
9328179 if you allow them to run they are big men they are capable they make headway over the gain line and then they can play
9328180 they get their arms free and the people around them grow in confidence
9328181 it draws more people to that area to stem the tide and it presents an opportunity wider
9328182 i dont go home and look at the score quite often im not conscious of the scoreboard
9328183 possibly we became a little bit outcome oriented in our approach to the game because when the outcome went so did some of the effort
9328184 we have to address those things and we can address them
9328185 weve picked up something to show for it along the way but the thing wed really like to show for it is ahead of us
9328186 its always good to get the confirmation that we are making progress and i guess weve got the opportunity in two weeks to show that we have made some headway
9328187 the fact we have been up and down means nothing
9328188 it doesnt mean we will be up next time it can be done
9328189 it wasnt a great moment for words to be honest
9328190 you cant fix these things with words you have to feel it because its real so these boys are feeling it
9328191 if that serves us well thats good but we wont be able to fix it with words
9328192 its a bit like when you touch a flame and you get burned you dont generally go back there
9328193 its what we do from here we are lucky we have an opportunity
9328194 the good thing is we have two weeks its been a good tour bar the last few hours get home catch up with family and friends get some down time recharge
9328195 and then theyll start thinking about what can be done well gather and well put some of those thoughts into action
9328196 the tri nations isnt over its a one off encounter one game that can make their season good whether they can do it remains to be seen
9328197 clearly felt like they needed to shake this race up and go for broke
9328198 we are happy to have that debate with the obama campaign and well win the argument with the american people
9328199 by any objective measure governor palin is more qualified for the presidency than barack obama
9328200 who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9328201 commonwealth debt eliminated surpluses replaced deficits and funding freed up in key areas of national concern
9328202 the essendon football club said can we book you in for the last friday of the last round to give a speech to honour james hird
9328203 if she bought a copy i might sign it for her she could take it back to that flat where she lives with the spartan furniture put it up on the bookshelf with her current library the collected works of marx and engels she could file it alphabetically by author cos it will come after com for the communist manifesto and before d for das kapital or she could it put by her bedside where shes reading a book on how to create unemployment in an economy which is undergoing a mining boom
9328204 some of the press are surprised that i should want to be a backbencher but the people of higgins are important to me they always have been i want to represent them there are things i want to do on behalf of them
9328205 i would like us to be perfect but were not that
9328206 were a happy team theres good spirit in the team we have all our good players available thats the key just having the key players in the key positions on the field
9328207 at the moment we have a pretty match fit football team that gives you confidence
9328208 not from me there isnt you can do what you want to do i know what i am going to do
9328209 hes probably going to have a long career ahead of him
9328210 friday night will challenge us immensely the competition is that close
9328211 feared for their safety and believed they would be assaulted if they had left the vehicle
9328212 we are currently considering what legal action we will take in relation to the matter
9328213 its not surprising that mr lloyd seeks to make these allegations as he has a record of attempting to smear construction workers and their unions in the public domain
9328214 the abcc has on previous occasions made untrue and incorrect allegations about the union we urge the public to treat these allegations with care
9328215 if people have done the wrong thing thats a matter for police the abcc doesnt have any jurisdiction over criminal matters we think it is all too convenient that mr lloyd finds these allegations just at the same time as the future of his organisation and his well paid taxpayer funded job is in fact under discussion
9328216 the rudd government will not tolerate unlawful or thuggish behaviour in the building and construction industry
9328217 this government will ensure there is always a tough cop on the beat in the building and construction industry
9328218 souhaitait passer une nuit avec lacteur m me en r ve car elle tait amoureuse de lui et le consid rait comme le chevalier de ses r ves

9328220 it was another great battle with stoner we know that stoner is very strong
9328221 to win my 68th race in my home town is incredible i saw giacomo agostini before the race and he was laughing so i said to him i would try to win today
9328222 we have a great advantage and we are one race closer to the title last year in these three races i took nine points this year 75 so its not too bad
9328223 thursday nights game has the potential to be a traffic and parking nightmare

9328312 insgesamt bin ich mit der runde extrem zufrieden und mit dem fortschritt den wir gemacht haben um das auto noch schneller zu machen
9328313 ich habe mir schon immer gedanken ber jimmie johnson gemacht
9328314 ich betrachte in als den wohl besten fahrer auf dieser strecke man wei nie was er w hrend eines rennens aus dem hut zaubern kann oder was ihm und chad knauss johnsons crewchief anm d red alles einf llt um deren wagen noch schneller zu machen

9328323 das war die h rteste berrundung die ich in diesem rennen hatte
9328324 okay sie haben auch um positionen gek mpft aber sie wussten dass ich von hinten komme oliver hat dann in kurve eins einen fehler gemacht kam weit nach au en und hat in kurve zwei dann die t r zugemacht irgendwann waren dann drei autos um mich herum und ich hatte wirklich angst dass an meinem auto etwas kaputt geht da habe ich ber funk gefragt hey jungs was geht hier ab aber danach habe eine eine freie linie gefunden um zwischen den jungs durchzukommen und ich denke sie haben dann auch paul sauber durchgelassen ich denke dass wir ein faires rennen hatten
9328325 um ehrlich zu sein ist es besser wenn man druck hat und sich die ganze zeit konzentrieren muss
9328326 er hat mir das leben ganz sch n schwer gemacht und hat einen tollen job gemacht doch ich konnte immer einen vorsprung von 0 5 sekunden bis zu einer sekunde halten nach den berrundungen war der abstand nat rlich jedes mal ein bisschen anders
9328327 ich denke dass es jetzt schon an der zeit ist ein bisschen an den titelgewinn denken zu d rfen
9328328 aber alles in allem war es toll ihn direkt im nacken zu haben
9328329 das hat das rennen f r mich einfacher gemacht weil ich nicht einmal mehr mitbekommen habe in welcher runde wir eigentlich waren irgendwann dachte ich ich schaue mal auf die boxentafel wie viele runden es noch sind da schrie mein ingenieur in den funk und ich fragte hey was ist los da sah ich die flagge das rennen war schon vorbei
9328330 ich denke dass es jetzt schon an der zeit ist ein bisschen an den titelgewinn denken zu d rfen aber ich sehe jedes rennen f r sich das ist vielleicht der schl ssel dazu es am ende zu schaffen es stehen immer noch drei rennen aus und es werden noch 30 punkte vergeben deshalb versuche ich einfach erst in barcelona dann in le mans und dann in hockenheim mein bestes man muss immer k mpfen in der dtm ist es jedes mal schwer das richtige set up zu finden ein wochenende kann durch einen kleinen fehler kaputtgemacht werden es ist hart bis zum schluss
9328331 ich meine er ist ein super talentierter fahrer und ich kann einfach nicht glauben dass es kimi ist der da im moment f hrt
9328332 er war immer schneller als massa massa ist schnell aber so weit hinten sollte er nicht liegen
9328333 and he aaron received them gold objects at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
9328334 let yhwh creator of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation who may go out before them and go in before them who may lead them out and bring them in that the congregation of yhwh may not be like sheep which have no shepherd and yhwh said to moses take joshua the son of nun with you a man in whom is the spirit and lay your hand on him
9328335 then he said i micaiah saw all israel scattered on the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and yhwh said these have no master let each return to his house in peace
9328336 give ear o shepherd of israel you who lead joseph like a flock you who dwell between the cherubim shine forth
9328337 for eternal creator says i will search and find my sheep i will be like a shepherd looking for his flock i will find my sheep and rescue them from all the places they were scattered in that dark and cloudy day and i will bring them back from among the people 14 and nations where they were back home to their own land of israel and i will feed them upon the mountains of israel and by the rivers where the land is fertile and good yes i will give them good pasture on the high hills of israel there they will lie down in peace and feed in luscious mountain pastures
9328338 and as for you o my flock my people eternal creator says i will judge you and separate good sheep from bad shepherds sheep from goats
9328339 therefore eternal creator says i will surely judge between these fat shepherds and their scrawny sheep
9328340 and i will raise up a notable vine the messiah in israel so that my people will never again go hungry nor be shamed by heathen conquest in this way they will know that i eternal creator am with them and that they the people of israel are my people says eternal creator
9328341 you are my flock the sheep of my pasture you are my men and i am your sovereign so says eternal ezek 34 1 31 tl
9328342 as truly as osiris lives so truly shall his follower live as truly as osiris is not dead he shall die no more as truly as osiris is not annihilated he shall not be annihilated
9328343 in the beginning there was isis oldest of the old she was the goddess from whom all becoming arose as the greatress she gave birth to the sun when he rose upon this earth for the first time
9328344 then yhwh told me to go again and get a job as a shepherd this time i was to act the part of a worthless wicked shepherd
9328345 come wild animals of the field come tear apart the sheep come wild animals of the forest devour my people for the leaders of my people yhwhs watchmen his shepherds are all blind to every danger they are featherbrained and give no warning when danger comes they love to lie there love to sleep to dream
9328346 therefore yhwh sovereign says i will destroy you for these visions and lies
9328347 if you refuse to warn the wicked when i want you to tell them you are under the penalty of death therefore repent and save your life they will die in their sins but i will punish you i will demand your blood for theirs
9328348 but you will lie no more no longer will you talk of seeing visions that you never saw nor practice your magic for i will deliver my people out of your hands by destroying you and you shall know i am yhwh
9328349 i will preserve a remnant of my people to possess the land of israel those i select will inherit it and serve me there
9328350 and i will give you leaders after my own heart who will guide you with wisdom and understanding
9328351 many foreign rulers have ravaged my vineyard trampling down the vines and turning all its beauty into barren wilderness
9328352 and david my servant the messiah shall be their king their only shepherd and they shall obey my laws and all my wishes they shall live in the land of israel where their fathers lived the land i gave my servant jacob they and their children after them shall live there and their grandchildren for all generations and my servant david their messiah shall be their prince forever and i will make a covenant of peace with them an everlasting pact i will bless them multiply them and put my temple among them forever
9328353 and i will live among the people of israel and be their sovereign
9328354 the royal line of david will be cut off chopped down like a tree but from the stump will grow a shoot yes a new branch from the old root and the spirit of yhwh shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom understanding counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of yhwh his delight will be obedience to yhwh he will not judge by appearance false evidence or hearsay but will defend the poor and the exploited he will rule against the wicked who oppress them for he will be clothed with fairness and with truth
9328355 the extra territoriality of holy sites in jerusalem to be transferred to vatican control

9328359 i will brief the syrian leadership with the current developments in the occupied arab territories
9328360 when someone breaks the rules of the game it is possible that the other part takes unilateral measures as well
9328361 you should warn arafat about losing an historic opportunity that may not return
9328362 i have asked pique to see if it is possible for king juan carlos to use his good relationships with some arab countries to make the parties move closer about jerusalem
9328363 our peace strategy leads to the possibility that perhaps some time in the month of september possibly at the end of the month we will be ready to go to a summit in which we would be able to make decisions and reach the end of the conflict
9328364 spain is following with great care and interest the difficult stage which the peace process is witnessing but he added that it seems there is a little hope following eight months of violence
9328365 after six months spain will preside over the eu and there will be a lot of fields in which opportunities for enhancing and intensifying cooperation and relations would be opened
9328366 the next meeting of the atheist book club will be on september 10 thats the 2nd wed of the month at 8 pm at the flagship half price books at 5803 e northwest highway we meet in the area next to the black forest coffee cafe they have a small sandwich menu pastries and drinks

9328369 sono partito bene ma pedrosa mi ha superato e ho perso tempo stoner andava fortissimo ma io mi sentivo bene avevo un buon passo e sicuramente non mi andava via poi lho visto scivolare ora sono 6 vittorie e 75 punti 6 di questi cappelli

9328374 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people those who lead you cause you to err and destroy the way of your paths
9328375 da li je va nije da beogra ani vide modiljanija jednom u ivotu ili zlatno pero

9328377 no that sucks nowhere near as good as the current design
9328378 with its domestic activities omv significantly contributes to the energy supply of austria as the oil and gas exploration in austria turns more and more difficult due to the maturity of most fields i am particularly happy that we have been able to successfully increase our domestic production in the past years through substantial investments the use of state of the art technologies as well as our professional expertise therefore i am confident will we be able to ramp up our domestic production by around 20 till 2010
9328379 my hope is through my story that others will learn how to engage in the war on terror from a biblical perspective as well as find encouragement and wisdom to overcome their tragedies and become conduits of god s healing grace and power to others even the people responsible for their loss
9328380 preach not because you have to say something but because you have something to say
9328381 for those who love the sermons of great preachers of yesteryear this is an ideal book to read the sermons are based on writings of charles spurgeon henry drummond d l moody leslie weatherhead stanley jones william barclay w e sangster d t niles etc my vision is to spread gods word in simple and very readable language which laymen can understand and ponder over
9328382 i started reading the book at 10 p m and could not lay it down till 4 next morning
9328383 historias verdaderas escritas con el olor y el ruido de la memoria de otros
9328384 casi todo resulta sorprendente en este libro que la editorial anagrama public en enero de 2004 su autor
9328385 el capit n alegr a es un bartleby que cuestiona la norma de aquellos con los que vive y no puede abandonar su visi n de lo que ocurre
9328386 la biblia para referirse a quienes se hayan desorientados dice de ellos que son como los girasoles ciegos no ven la luz del sol andan perdidos
9328387 du schau mal die beiden kommissare hier wird doch wohl nichts passiert sein
9328388 vielleicht haben die auch nur frei auch polizisten m ssen ja mal feierabend haben
9328389 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9328390 the overall market in 2008 is not very good and europe is even worse
9328391 we are seeing people are more sensitive to promotional deals but have not seen signs of consumers turning to third tier brands
9328392 were not planning to subsidize this exchange rate swing at all well either find ways of reducing the costs still further or we may have to adjust prices upwards
9328393 we have not seen an impact on consumer spending yet
9328394 i see prices for blu ray devices to come down more and more before christmas

9328398 this morning i was supposed to be in brisbane but i am still in thailand
9328399 it was a beautiful holiday but now it has become a nightmare
9328400 i dont have any money i tried to pay for the hotel on my credit card but there was not enough money on it
9328401 i am trying to call my travel insurance but its difficult and the airport is still closed so i dont know when we can go home
9328402 all we can say is that at the height of the season there can be as many as 20 000 australians in phuket at one time
9328403 they have to drop you 20 minutes away from the airport so you have to walk with your luggage and then wait to find out if the planes are going
9328404 if you didnt know youd just think it was normal except for a few people talking on the street about it
9328405 im not fussed if they dont fly for another 48 hours id rather be stuck here than in bangkok
9328406 it hasnt been real good ive got one friend who came the other day who had to jump the fence to get out of the airport because all the people were barricading the gates
9328407 another mate cant get out hes due back at work but he cant get a flight
9328408 its a really weird feeling because it is so dead calm
9328409 there is no rain or wind like you get in australia before a storm so its hard to believe anything is about to happen here at all
9328410 i am not being a daredevil and i feel very calm and well looked after with police making multiple patrols checking on the welfare of people around town
9328411 my friends are blaming me for bringing the bad weather to new orleans
9328412 i tried to conceive for 12 stress filled months then as soon as i stopped obsessing about having a baby i fell pregnant
9328413 so i became very interested in looking at the possible effects of emotional issues and the impact this might be having for couples wanting to fall pregnant
9328414 for a lot of the people i spoke to there were hidden fears that hadnt really been addressed like fear of repeating the mistakes of the past fear of subsequent miscarriage or fears of not being a good mother
9328415 its a really individual thing but the common feeling is at some point theres an emotional shift a letting go and many women fall pregnant soon after that
9328416 has really caught up and there are improved pregnancy rates for those on stress reduction programs for instance
9328417 a lot of women are only given very physical approaches and this offers another angle
9328418 there are no studies in humans to confirm this but what we do know is that stress can reduce fertility in a number of ways
9328419 we do our best to make sure we look after our patients minds as well as their bodies
9328420 some do acupuncture and others attend our lifestyle modification clinics or see counsellors
9328421 its becoming a bit of a trend and we believe hell probably keep going until hes caught
9328422 hes been described as being calm he speaks to his victims and then produces the weapon
9328423 i thought about it because one of the guys was georgian i know this person
9328424 he would never start fighting when i walked outside he was being beaten by three men
9328425 it could be the reason this guy who was stabbed he was trying to defend this georgian man
9328426 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9328427 its still early we still got a long way to go
9328428 but weve got a good group of guys here who can do it
9328429 it needs to move to a safer quieter location because theres just no margin for error here
9328430 the airports under a 50 year lease to be used for aviation activities with an option to renew it for 49 years but that doesnt mean it will be impossible to close
9328431 you feel like you can touch them when they fly over and its mainly in the early hours of the morning at 2 to 3am
9328432 no one will want to live out this way if we dont stop this
9328433 you cant let the little ones out into the back yard when its a day when all the fumes are about
9328434 theres no time limit for them to respond by but once they do the clock will start again and the minister has 50 days to approve or reject the master plans
9328435 its diverted officers from the suburbs into the cbds safe streets taskforce it bungled the 2am lockout to the point of irrelevancy and now statistics indicate banning notices create more harm than good
9328436 there is no evidence to suggest that the banning notices have simply moved the problem on
9328437 anecdotally we are aware that the banning notice simply encourages friends to look out for one another and ensure they can get home safely
9328438 the jump in assaults on yarra streets is almost twice the spike the cbd suffered in 2006 07 that prompted victoria police to mobilise in the safe streets taskforce
9328439 we are 90 to 100 per cent certain that cedric is resistant to the disease but as in all science we can never be completely definitive
9328440 while this development does not represent a cure it is one of the most significant scientific outcomes since the contagious cancer was first recorded on the northeast coast of tasmania 12 years ago and is direct result of the collaborative effort through the save the tasmanian devil program
9328441 from our latest findings we can conclude that it is possible to make some devils resistant to dftd by vaccination and we are hoping that as there is more genetic diversity in the west some devils will be naturally resistant
9328442 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9328443 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9328444 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9328445 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9328446 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed

9328452 a growing housing shortage is setting the scene for the mother of all housing booms
9328453 demand has accelerated and rising immigration both permanent and temporary shows no sign of abating meanwhile rising interest rates continue to stymie any building recovery
9328454 underlying housing demand is already outstripping new supply and the gap is set to widen sharply driving pent up housing demand to record levels
9328455 with population growing at the fastest rate in 18 years we simply should be building more homes not less
9328456 interest rate hikes have spooked investors and budding owner occupiers
9328457 investors are putting their money in the bank and people are staying in the rental market longer but the situation is unsustainable
9328458 the latest slump in new dwelling approvals is clearly bad news for those renting
9328459 the supply of apartments isnt rising but the number of people wanting to rent certainly is
9328460 all ive heard is people use the word quokka and then smile and laugh
9328461 members of the press have in passing mentioned the word quokka and suggested to me that something inappropriate in the past may have happened
9328462 a videotape of buswell and other plastered libs playing quokka soccer
9328463 as i understand it that blog is the source of the joke rumour
9328464 it appears a kind of chinese whispers has occurred and now it will be prime time tv news amazing and disappointing
9328465 i have absolutely no idea about these stories of quokkas on rottnest
9328466 im not being backward in saying that im not a perfect individual and you know ive had a robust past and there may be elements of that that have proved offensive to people
9328467 i dont shy away away from that at all but im not aware that ive caused any offence to a quokka
9328468 that is that everybody accepts their responsibility to the collective and to the voters of the state and that they knuckle down and do their jobs properly
9328469 i mean fanciful stories like this dont do anyone any benefit
9328470 after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
9328471 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
9328472 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
9328473 what they did for us in there was pretty outstanding the trouble they went to
9328474 he thought he jones might be a risk to me
9328475 he should do his time first i think they should have thought a bit more about what they were doing
9328476 there were a number of investigations made to ensure the bride or any other family members including children were not at risk

9328538 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9328539 as prime minister i told i would have been convening the leaders to figure out how we work on these key issues
9328540 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9328541 its not a surprise that on the main issues of the day he does not have the same approach that the government does and that theres very little room for common ground
9328542 he wants an election in the best interests of his party
9328543 there is no loophole in the law for mr harper and it absolutely does not have any relevance to minority government

9328556 the signing of this treaty not only brings to an end the historic differences in the past between italy and libya but should also start a new era of cooperation between libya italy and the eu with regards to the issue of irrregular migration
9328557 we really look forward to libya taking part in joint missions with italy malta and other eu countries in the mediterranean sea to break up the tremendous racket of human traffickers that are exploiting people and using them as a source of illegal enrichment
9328558 the signing of this treaty is really good news next week in the european parliament there should be further good news when the report of green mep jean lambert will be voted upon
9328559 this week could be a positive week as regards progress in tackling the difficult migration issue which the maltese people have to face
9328560 we got punched in the mouth early we got some good looks but we couldnt make a shot really conner teahan bailed us out in the first half because he made a couple of threes when we didnt have any offense at all
9328561 to go from 11 point lead to three means we did not perform very well down the stretch
9328562 we made some big free throws down the stretch but give them credit they made some shots that we pretty well guarded
9328563 i thought we played hard after we got started carleton played hard they are so well coached
9328564 you always want the win but i was happier with the way we competed
9328565 we played really well basically the last 35 minutes of the game i really didnt know if our team could win this game because we dont have our guys meaning the morris twins but certainly they responded well
9328566 we came out and did what we needed to do on the defensive end
9328567 we started out slow and coach got after us and after a few time outs we finally picked it up
9328568 we must fight the urge to postpone everything until copenhagen surely we can make concrete progress on some issues
9328569 i would emphasize the need to make the most of the upcoming opportunity in poznan poland

9328589 but for every one of those there are many more who are desperate to get back on the rails and those are the people i wanted to help
9328590 what is shocking though is the sheer scale of the problem government must do more to help these people they often find themselves in positions of complete helplessness because there isnt any help for them
9328591 what sort of country can let their people live like this it is like there is another london inside london away from all the bright lights
9328592 i had no idea how bad it was until i lived with these people for 10 days some people have no access to water let alone hot water and of course no goodies like televisions
9328593 my interest in this started when i got talking to a homeless girl last year i bought her breakfast and we chatted for a couple of hours about her life i decided then that i wanted to do something and was already aware of the channel 4 show
9328594 i was delighted when they gave me a chance to do a little something and give someone a chance to make a better life

9328606 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9328607 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational

9328613 im obsessive about a lot of aspects of the band i dont want to mess it all up
9328614 i have this routine now thats taught me how to control my breathing and its helped me not get so tense when im in the air
9328615 at my very worst i turned down a trip with u2 on their vertigo jet it was so bad i opted to stay in poland instead
9328616 the lack of control the doctor has been teaching me to consider the whole experience as an outsider like youre detached almost like youre actually watching yourself its been amazing and its really been helping me let go of not having any control thats the worst thing about it the short breaths come and youve lost control
9328617 i grew up being a fan of the great rocknroll bands
9328618 now we know something great is in our grasp and we want to get it right
9328619 im obsessive about a lot of aspects of the band ridiculous stuff really like t shirt designs and other little things i dont want to mess it all up
9328620 at the very beginning we just didnt have the time to even think about how we might be perceived
9328621 we wrote these songs and before we knew it we were signed and on the road we were so busy around the time of the first album 2004s hot fuss that someone just handed us a stack of pictures and we just picked one for the cover thats not really the right way to go about it
9328622 struggling with what im supposed to do and what im supposed to be
9328623 i think a lot of people in bands talk about liberal politics because theyre artists and theyre supposed to be on the left but ive spent a lot of time trying to work out who i am and i always come back to the middle i dont really want to talk about this i think acknowledging im different from people in most bands is enough of a statement in itself
9328624 i think the less time me and you spend together is for the better
9328625 you grow up as a music fan frothing at the mouth at the romance of it all over depeche mode pictures and bowie album sleeves and its hard not being able to control those things i mean the magazines wont let you pick the pictures they use some magazines wont review us live now because of it but its worth it to feel like i have some control
9328626 to be honest every time we make a record i just hope i can write another when you were young the bands 2006 mega hit does this record do that thats not for me to say but there are songs on there i do think are pretty special

9328628 your suit was the whitest thing since you know who
9328629 we are certain that one of the bodies is that of jill foster and the other is believed to be that of a man
9328630 the post mortem examination did show that jill died from a gunshot wound to the head further tests are needed to try and establish a cause of death for the other body
9328631 the two bodies were found close to one another and the body of another dog found nearby
9328632 the dog has also been subject of a post mortem examination which revealed it too had been shot
9328633 three horses and three dogs found in the outhouses had also been shot
9328634 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9328635 concerns were raised for the safety of those in the building and the walls of the house had begun to lean in towards where search and forensic teams were working
9328636 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9328637 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which is not helpful to our inquiry
9328638 police continue to work around the clock to establish the facts on what happened at osbaston house that morning and our thoughts remain with the families of chris jill and kirstie foster
9328639 the events which have unfolded in our village this week have bewildered and stunned every one of us not only in this community but across the country
9328640 it is hard to grasp exactly what has happened and it is clearly going to be some time before everything is revealed but today we pray for the fosters and their family and friends who must be devastated by the events of early last tuesday morning
9328641 we are shocked absolutely shocked its not the sort of thing that occurs in a country district like this
9328642 everybody is stunned we want to support the people involved its very sad
9328643 when something like this happens in a community it stuns folk its idyllic shropshire it doesnt happen here but it has happened here
9328644 people are wanting to do something we can pray for people as we always do in church
9328645 people have been bewildered and stunned how can it happen here
9328646 they the fosters had not been in the community long and were not pretty well known but nevertheless its a tremendous shock a small community like this always support each other
9328647 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9328648 do you think that the things people make fools of themselves about are any less real and true than the things they behave sensibly about they are more true they are the only things that are true

9328663 but over the last 12 months the picture changed strong operating momentum is now propelling genuine operational growth despite u s economic weakness
9328664 acquisitions and cost cuts have accounted for most of ibms growth in recent years in the 10 years ended 2006 sales increased at an annualized rate of less than 2 and the company lost both market share and in uence
9328665 however sales growth has accelerated in each of the last three quarters and per share pro ts have risen at least 23 in each period consensus estimates trending upward over the last month project per share pro t growth of 24 in 2008 and 11 in 2009
9328666 a broad business mix has helped the company keep growing during the economic slowdown ibm may still be best known for its hardware but the companys strength over the last year has stemmed from the services and software businesses which tend to be less economically sensitive than hardware
9328667 hardware accounted for about 18 of sales in the six months ended june while services represented 58 and software generated 20 financing operations brought in most of the last 4
9328668 while the current economic climate has pinched the consumer companies are still investing heavily in new technology
9328669 in the june quarter ibm signed 14 7 billion in service contracts up 12 increasing the services backlog to 117 billion nearly twice annual services revenue
9328670 software revenue jumped 15 in the six months ended june services and software growth more than offset a 2 decline in revenue from the systems and technology unit which produces servers and other hardware
9328671 ibm is also benefiting from its strong presence overseas particularly in emerging markets foreign sales accounted for 63 of 2007 revenue a percentage likely to increase in coming years
9328672 emerging markets such as brazil russia india and china which combined to post a 31 sales gain in the june quarter represent a strong growth opportunity for ibm the company is investing heavily in the four huge countries as well as in eastern europe and the middle east
9328673 management expressed concern about economic weakness in some of the worlds largest developed markets including the u s but that worry has been factored into growth expectations
9328674 ibm targets per share pro ts of 10 to 11 in 2010 representing annualized growth of 12 to 16 from 2007 levels given its growth prospects the stock seems attractively valued at 13 times estimated year ahead earnings below the ve year average forward p e ratio of 15

9328760 you know unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america ill eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class

9328781 i left my village 12 days ago when the waters first started to rise i went out to find food for the cattle and ended up at this camp
9328782 i havent seen my family since i want to get them out but no boats are going there i dont know what they are eating or what they are drinking
9328783 we need the rescue operation to find our families now but there are not enough boats
9328784 not one person from ratanpatti has made it to this camp
9328785 the problem is that the area is huge and more than 1 000 villages are in the water
9328786 there is overcrowding in the shelters so we need to go in and to vaccinate quickly
9328787 nepalese and indian authorities are working to protect the volatile areas in order to avoid flooding in more villages
9328788 hundreds of labourers have been mobilised and are dropping sand bags to stop further erosion and inundation
9328789 we remain cautiously optimistic that the dialogue is going to be successfully concluded
9328790 this is why we feel as mdc we have to be committed to the success of the dialogue
9328791 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9328792 of course the talks continue there isnt a timeframe and we are not going to be obliged to impose timeframes
9328793 for us the most important thing is that these talks must continue and we must find a solution its not a pr exercise we are not going to walk like beauty queens on a catwalk we have never done that its not in our nature
9328794 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9328795 there is nothing coming out of those discussions they are just wasting time they should just go public and say that the talks have collapsed
9328796 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia

9328799 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9328800 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9328801 there is no point in isolation russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9328802 have the courage to disconnect yourself from your material things you cannot protect yourself against what mother nature is going to send us
9328803 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9328804 on this track gustav will be moving across the central gulf of mexico today sunday and make landfall on the northern gulf coast on monday
9328805 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet more than six meters above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the center of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9328806 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9328807 a great effort was made to obscure or obfuscate the truth
9328808 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9328809 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad

9328815 es war ein hartes st ck arbeit aber ich bin bergl cklich
9328816 paul hat auch alles gegeben ich musste st ndig in den r ckspiegel schauen vielen dank f r den fairen kampf
9328817 f r uns ist es ein fantastischer tag ich freue mich sehr ber meinen sieg
9328818 hier kann man fast nicht berholen erst recht wenn der mann vor dir genauso schnell ist wie du selbst scheider ist sehr stark gefahren
9328819 das war ein ganz wichtiger tag im kampf um den titel jetzt habe ich neun punkte vorsprung bei noch drei verbleibenden rennen das ist ein gutes polster ber meinen zweiten sieg bin ich sehr gl cklich insbesondere weil ich in den vergangenen jahren hier nie ein gutes ergebnis erzielt habe danke an mercedes benz und insbesondere bernd schneider f r das faire man ver gegen rennende
9328820 insgesamt war es eine gute leistung am gesamten wochenende und wir k nnen mit dem ergebnis zufrieden sein jetzt schauen wir auf barcelona dort sollte mehr drin sein als hier
9328821 ein vers hnliches wochenende ich kam hierher mit dem ziel zu gewinnen doch nach meinen getriebeproblemen im qualifying und dem daraus resultierenden siebten startplatz ist das ergebnis in ordnung
9328822 es war ein hartes und unterhaltsames rennen das vor diesen begeisterten zuschauern nat rlich spa gemacht hat timo hat zwar einen start ziel sieg herausgefahren aber er durfte sich keine einzige schw che leisten denn paul di resta war die ganze zeit ber in seinem windschatten mattias ekstr m hat ebenfalls eine starke leistung gezeigt denn nach dem start k mpfte er sich mit tollen rundenzeiten und einer perfekten strategie vom siebten auf den dritten platz vor das war ein dtm rennen vom feinsten wir haben unsere position im titelkampf mit nun neun punkten vorsprung verbessert aber es gibt bei drei noch ausstehenden l ufen keinen anlass sich zur ckzulehnen ich freue mich auch dar ber dass es ein besonders faires rennen war
9328823 gratulation an audi timo scheider hat keinen fehler gemacht darauf hatte paul di resta gelauert aber paul hat mit zehn kilogramm mehrgewicht einen hervorragenden job gemacht auch lewis hamilton der neben mir an der boxenmauer das rennen geschaut hat war sehr begeistert knapper kann ein rennen nicht ausgehen das war werbung f r den motorsport wir sind racer und geben nat rlich lange noch nicht auf nun werden wir gewicht in unseren autos abbauen und in barcelona wieder angreifen
9328824 what would t be like to know that you are the ocean and not just the drop
9328825 fixing our eyes on jesus the author and finisher of our faith
9328826 the confusion of law and gospel is the principal source of all the abuses that corrupt or have ever corrupted the church
9328827 but now apart from law the righteousness of god has been disclosed and is attested by the law and the prophets the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe
9328828 are now justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a propitiation by his blood received through faith
9328829 what they are looking for is a better life can you lead them to a place or to a group of people that will deliver the building blocks of a better life do not propose christianity as a system of rules but as a relationship with the one who leads by way of example then seek proven ways to achieve meaning and success
9328830 a god without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through a christ without a cross
9328831 f r mich hat sich nach dem zeittraining alles ge ndert
9328832 hier ist es sehr schwierig zu berholen gerade weil die autos so eng beieinander liegen
9328833 timo und paul zogen davon bruno konnte ihre pace allerdings nicht mitgehen
9328834 ich fuhr die letzten beiden stints alleine aber mir gelang ein sehr gutes rennen nur hatte ich am freitag eigentlich mehr erwartet
9328835 it is time now for the prime minister to consider himself and decide whether he is still fit to be prime minister
9328836 if he insists on clinging to his office the problems of the country will escalate
9328837 it is not a matter of indecent behaviour i did not do anything wrong and have the right to continue my work as prime minister how i have behaved has not caused any damage to the country
9328838 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign no matter how much pressure on my government the government cannot resolve the problem so this joint session of parliament is the best way to try to find a solution
9328839 there was also some breaking news out of ohio today when republican presidential candidate john mccain introduced the world to his third wife
9328840 east asia pollution aerosols could impose far reaching environmental impacts at continental hemispheric and global scales because of long range transport
9328841 this is very challenging science with lots of complexities and a lot of uncertainties
9328842 this pollution is distributed on average equally from northern california to british columbia
9328843 anyone who has gone out to measure it has found something
9328844 people assumed the atmosphere scrubbed itself and didnt believe these pollutants could travel thousands of miles
9328845 europe even as pollution from europe can circle the globe and reach the u s air can circulate around the world in three weeks or less the national academies of science is not limiting itself to pollution from asia and will study the phenomenon worldwide

9328886 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9328887 these 30 odd hours or more will be me concentrating on what happened in the second half
9328888 they had one bit of brilliance and we had two bad mistakes so put that together and you get the result
9328889 i thought the game was terrific in the first half
9328890 it was end to end but i thought we were alright and playing some good stuff
9328891 we were quite comfortable and i didnt see that coming in the second half
9328892 the passing of the ball was half decent by both sides but its all about brilliance which is what mendes did
9328893 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9328894 a bit of an issue because i have two journal articles out and its been brought to my attention that a search brings up writing of a very mixed tone quality

9329060 i think we already lost the war and im afraid there is no military solution of this situation
9329061 when i said we georgians are not winners in this conflict it does not mean russia has won
9329062 russia showed once again its real face that it preferred to be the gendarme in international relations and not to be a distinguished member of the international community that will be respected
9329063 in due course i expect there will be some new waves of mass protests here in the country
9329064 to what extent this government will be able to survive those protests remains to be seen but it is obvious there will be some internal political instability
9329065 i do not see any major breach from our side the principles we stayed for years we do not want to confront russia with its huge resources but its russia that wants to reconquer georgia so we should not defend ourselves
9329066 its not something they feel comfortable with so the path of development of this situation and whether they will apply this invasion pattern to other countries in the neighborhood would depend on how strongly the international community would pursue the line it has taken
9329067 this is a very decisive moment either russia succeeds and the west fails or west succeeds and russia fails

9329133 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9329134 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9329135 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

9329140 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9329141 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9329142 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9329143 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9329144 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9329145 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9329146 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9329147 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9329148 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9329149 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9329150 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9329161 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9329162 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9329167 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9329168 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9329169 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9329170 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9329171 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9329175 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9329176 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9329177 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9329178 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9329179 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9329180 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica

9329191 im a fastball pitcher and i command my fastball well and i just wanted to establish that tonight before i went to anything else so i did throw a lot of fastballs the first two innings
9329192 i think i shook varitek off one time and the one time i did it was a base hit laughs so i probably shouldnt have shook him off piersynksi i think it was a fastball away
9329193 varitek had the confidence in the young guy to have him throw that change up up in key counts and because of that he was effective with that fastball
9329194 just trying to get a good pitch to hit and hit it just trying to get on base thats my job sometimes you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times where you are good the last couple of days i got on base every time its just one of those things
9329195 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on the top of big brown to beat the white sox right now hes on a roll this guy right now is on fire
9329196 het is niet te zien dat hij daar veel tijd aan besteedt
9329197 awalnya kami enggan mengomentari sikap robinho karena biar bagaimanapun dia tak akan bisa pergi karena klausul kontrak mengatakan hal itu kecuali dia mampu membeli sisa kontraknya
9329198 tetapi sikap dan pernyataan para direksi chelsea mengenai masalah ini termasuk menjual kaos dengan nama punggung robinho jelas telah menyinggung perasaan real madrid
9329199 saya tetap ingin meninggalkan madrid dan bermain untuk chelsea cuma chelsea yang ada dalam pikiran saya
9329200 saya sudah ingin memperpanjang kontrak sejak bulan mei namun madrid mengacuhkan itu pasalnya mereka ingin merekrut cristiano ronaldo kini setelah mereka gagal mereka justru menahan saya
9329201 presiden ramon calderon sudah mengatakan bakal melepas saya jika ada tawaran bagus yang datang saya pun sudah menyampaikan niat untuk pergi kepada presiden direktur olahraga dan pelatih jika schuster mau mempertahankan pemain yang tak senang menetap maka itu tanggung jawab dia
9329202 kotsays been fun hes been fun to be around since he got here jasons just been solid and consistent for us since hes been here hes done the little things stole some bases played good defense hes just settled right in and has been a big part of our success
9329203 he just has a good fun spirit about him i dont know what else to say other than he likes being here

9329207 oleh karena itu kini ia harus tahu kalau pada kenyataannya kami siap memberikan hukuman kepadanya mungkin hukuman ini tidak ringan dan dapat menyakiti perasaan setiap pemain lainnya

9329243 grace beautiful silver tear drop cut out bird and vine earrings
9329244 why exactly do we need a train in the reunion scene far as i can see monique is going to drag it all over the beach and itll collect sand
9329245 you know that moment when she appears at the end of the beach and stands on that rock there and the wind suddenly picks up imagine the effect itll be magnificent
9329246 this is an island in the middle of the sea uncle the winds come and go as they please not as we command
9329247 why was there even a pin there has someone been burying pins along the beach
9329248 what are we going to do what are we going to do
9329249 though from what i saw her trajectory was straight out to sea
9329250 doesnt that give rise to the concern due to her as another fellow human being within any of you is that whats happening here
9329251 we cant possibly rewrite the script for only one character now
9329252 if this were new york i could go out into the street and find another actress in a second but
9329253 she has a background in vaudeville i believe her to be a competent actress in her own right
9329254 come to think of it she even resembles her excellent idea miss thimble the show must go on
9329255 lets run you through the rest of the script miss
9329256 we can do all the dialogue that i was forced to take out last time because you know monique wasnt the most expressive of actresses
9329257 that we may be the only sane people on the island
9329258 your uncle is most definitely all bananas in the fruit and vegetables section
9329259 no offence meant meyer looks shifty cicero is drunk and i thought tess was pretty sane right until she volunteered me for this business
9329260 you are a pretty good actress definitely heaps better than monique not to say of course that there isnt something wrong with tess did you get that feeling that that wind just now was a very intentional one
9329261 but back to my point given that we have established that there is something vaguely wrong everyone else in the cast and crew that leaves you apart from the fact that youve managed to insult me in every other conversation weve had you seem to me to be quite all right
9329262 but this conversation is not yet over and thus i havent got my hopes up
9329263 it was always completely unintentional i am naturally talkative in your presence i am even more talkative this is a very curious fact which i find myself unable to explain perhaps it is a symptom of something i know not what
9329264 but never mind that now the point is we are the only sane people on this island and sane people ought to keep an eye out for each other and everyone else if we have the time for it
9329265 i have always always tried to keep an eye out for my uncle a family burden but we really ought to be getting back those insane people who run this production will be missing you
9329266 our only relationship mr cicero is a working one and dont call me cass
9329267 you couldnt kiss me like that and not mean it just a teensy bit
9329268 i think theres still some pulse we ought to resuscitate him
9329269 it was him wanting to do it to me that started this in the first place
9329270 you see it all started when we heard a noise sort of like a pop
9329271 yes that and then we saw cicero just standing there and all of a sudden he started swallowing something
9329272 he was swallowing pills six of them it looked like
9329273 how should we know we were just passing by and then there was this squishing noise and he fell down and hes been like this ever since
9329274 and what were the two of you doing out here at this hour
9329275 so i wanted to take a walk along the beach and cassandra was
9329276 i must have lost it in the jungle during filming

9329412 siapa yang mahu membeli kambing ini dengan harga satu dirham
9329413 apakah kalian mahu jika anak kambing ini keberikan kepada kalian
9329414 demi allah kalaupun anak kambing itu hidup kami tidak akan menerimanya kerana cacatnya maka bagaimana kami mahu menerimanya setelah menjadi bangkai
9329415 demi allah pandangan dunia itu lebih hina dalam pandangan allah daripada bangkai kambing cacat ini dalam pandangan kalian
9329416 rasulullah saw tidur di atas tikar dan ketika bangun berbekaslah tikar itu pada belakangnya lalu kami bertanya
9329417 untuk apa dunia ini bagiku aku di dunia ini bagaikan seorang musafir berhenti sebentar di bawah pohon kemudian pergi meninggalkannya
9329418 hidup yang sesungguhnya itu baru dimulai pada saat kita mati
9329419 dunia ini bagaikan penjara bagi orang mukmin dan bagaikan syurga bagi orang orang kafir
9329420 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya kehidupan dunia itu hanyalah permainan dan suatu yang melalaikan perhiasan dan bermegah megah antara kamu serta berbangga bangga tentang banyaknya harta dan anak seperti hujan yang tanam tanamannya mengagumkan para petani kemudian tanaman itu menjadi kering dan kamu lihat warnanya kuning kemudian menjadi hancur dan di akhirat nanti ada azab yang keras dan ampunan dari allah serta keredhaan nya dan kehidupan dunia ini tidak lain hanyalah kesenangan yang menipu
9329421 dijadikan indah pada pandangan manusia kecintaan kepada apa apa yang diingini yaitu wanita wanita anak anak harta yang banyak dari jenis emas perak kuda pilihan binatang binatang ternak dan sawah ladang itulah kesenangan hidup di dunia dan di sisi allah lah tempat kembali yang baik surga
9329422 dan carilah pada apa yang telah dianugerahkan allah kepadamu kebahagiaan negeri akhirat dan janganlah kamu melupakan bahagianmu dari kenikmatan duniawi dan berbuat baiklah kepada orang lain sebagaimana allah telah berbuat baik kepadamu dan janganlah kamu berbuat kerusakan di muka bumi sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang berbuat kerusakan
9329423 dan sesungguhnya kami menempatkan kamu di atas bumi ini dan kami jadikan untuk kamu di atas bumi itu penghidupan buat kamu tetapi sedikit sekali di antara kamu yang bersyukur
9329424 yang mencampuri keikhlasan itu adalah kerakusan terhadap dunia dan mengumpul ngumpulkannya
9329425 makanlah di antara rezeki yang baik yang telah kami berkan kepadamu dan jangalah melampaui batas padanya yang menyebabkan kemurkaan menimpamu dan barangsiapa ditimpa oleh kemurkaan ku maka sesungguhnya binasalah dia
9329426 kami adalah kaum yang tidak makan sebelum merasa lapar dan bila kami makan tak pernah kekenyangan
9329427 dan orang orang yang apabila membelanjakan harta mereka tidak berlebih lebihan dan tidak pula kikir dan adalah pembelanjaan itu di tengah tengah antara yang demikian
9329428 lihatlah orang yang di bawahmu dan jangan melihat orang yang di atasmu kerana yang demikian itu lebih baik supaya kamu tidak meremehkan nikmat yang dikurniakan allah kepadamu
9329429 bukanlah zuhud itu mengharamkan yang halal bukan pula menyia nyiakan harta tetapi zuhud dalam dunia itu ialah engkau tidak memandang apa yang ada di tanganmu itu lebih diperlukan dari apa yang ada di sisi allah swt

9329550 despite making an excellent start to the season and leading the world championship going into the german gp during the last few races dani pedrosa has made it know to both michelin and honda that he doesnt feel at ease with the tyres that michelin have offered him
9329551 honda and michelin believe that rider confidence needs to be at its maximum if the rider is to fully exploit the tactical potential of the tyres

9329649 sheriff fletcher does not have three buckets of urine there are two buckets of gray water in the bathroom that were collected from a downstairs sink its part of a permaculture program to minimize impact on the environment they disconnected the sink drainage from the sewer system and use it for toilet water to use less water when they flush the other bucket was collected from an illegal garage apartment the guy had been living there for years and did not have a working toilet yes he peed in a bucket but he did not have anything to do with the rnc he has nothing to do with the people living in the house he has nothing to do with protests it was seized from an apartment that has absolutely nothing to do with the people in the home or any plan to protest the rnc
9329650 police seized political literature cellphones computers cameras personal diaries and many common household items such as paint rope and roofing nails these items are present in almost any home in south minneapolis and are not evidence of a crime
9329651 seizing boxes of political literature shows the motive of these raids was political sheriff fletcher has staged a publicity stunt violated constitutional rights and misrepresented what was seized during the raids
9329652 conspiracy to commit riot was the charge used against the chicago 8 after the police riots in chicago during the 1968 democratic convention
9329653 guild attorneys defended those charged in 1968 and we will do so again now
9329654 it was a rifle barrel that was in a hutch on the stairwell landing

9329656 these are all amazingly kind people who are just trying to fight something unjust
9329657 what of these things is evidence to incite a riot its absurd
9329658 i can guarantee you no one was planning on using throwing knives at the demonstration no one thinks that is a way to create attention for the issues this is a political protest and the issues at hand are most important i challenge ramsey county sheriff bob fletcher to show me one instance in the last 20 years where anyone has used throwing knives at a demonstration its ridiculous
9329659 did they have some devices to try to block traffic maybe so
9329660 but does that mean they should be arrested on conspiracy charges not at all this was intended to halt the protests
9329661 the timing of this is another example of motivation behind the raid
9329662 this has been an ongoing investigation if they have evidence of a criminal act then they should charge them not hold them for 36 hours which for in this case is four and half days
9329663 why was the piece of paper so altered from when the hortons found it was it proof of a conspiracy or careless handling by the police the mystery remains
9329664 targeting political organizers in a pre emptive strike is a tactic from the 60s this country is better than that
9329665 were seeking sanctuary to call attention to the illegal tactics police violence harassment and mass arrests of the ramsey county sheriff who has ordered the politically motivated arrests of dedicated community activists on false pretenses to make it more difficult for ordinary people to express their dissent

9329671 i leave you with two things as long as you hold them tightly you never go astray they are the book of allah and my sunnah
9329672 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers

9329675 the singur issue has become a serious problem for every one but if nano rolls out from the tata motors factory at singur it will be highly beneficial for west bengal
9329676 the central government does not want to comment or interfere in the states matter the state government and the tatas will have to sort out the problems themselves all we can say is that let there be industrialisation at the same time increase food production

9329684 the ldf yesterday decided to launch a protest strike against the central government by staging a march to parliament when the next session begins what wrong has the central government done this is nothing but a gimmick to camouflage their weak governance here

9329722 ive got an idea for the second series why not have a giant bourbon biscuit pretending to be a traffic warden lol because biscuits are inanimate and couldnt possibly issue parking tickets wacky or what

9329724 bbc3 have decided against taking it further because they dont feel it caters to their 16 24 target demographic im aware that left to my own devices the kind of stuff i produce is not particularly in synch with the world of lilly allen and gavin amp stacey and it may never have the potential to cross over the way those chaps have but i hoped there might be room for a diversity of shows on bbc3 especially as a series of meebox would have cost less to produce than a couple of episodes of the wall so it could hardly be thought of as a costly risk

9329748 reflecting a consensus of hundreds of scientists around the world the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has affirmed that greenhouse gas emissions are raising the earths temperature
9329749 the earth is on a trajectory to warm more than 4 5 degrees fahrenheit by around mid century exceeding that threshold trigger a series of phenomena arable land will turn into desert higher sea levels will flood coastal areas and changes in the convection of the oceans will alter currents such as the gulf stream that determine regional weather patterns
9329750 manhattan and florida would be under water while nevada would have no water at all
9329751 urgent and drastic action by the international community is required and the united states must take the lead
9329752 americans produce more than four times as much carbon per capita as the chinese 12 times as much as indians and more than twice as much as citizens of germany france britain and japan unless the united states acts first it will have no credibility in persuading other countries to do their share
9329753 to their credit mccain and obama support the creation of a cap and trade system that would limit national emissions trading among firms would put a price on carbon that is an essential step toward changing industry behavior encouraging energy conservation and providing an incentive for new technologies
9329754 but the domestic obstacles to these and other measures are daunting while some industries will prosper other sectors of the economy especially those that produce or rely on coal steel and cement will contract
9329755 coping with the resulting economic and political hardships would be onerous even if the next president inherited forward looking climate change policies
9329756 but george w bush has pursued an anti policy based on a combination of denial procrastination and backsliding his successor will have to make up for lost time while also dealing with a half trillion dollar federal deficit a recession and a national housing crunch a looming health care crisis wars in iraq and afghanistan and diplomatic showdowns with north korea and iran
9329757 the winner in november will need all the help he can get including from his opponent who will go back to the senate as a major voice on this and other issues the next president will also need support from the private sector nongovernmental organizations academia and crucially citizens who recognize the consequences if they do not consent to sacrifices and changes in lifestyle
9329758 many americans will accept that logic and make real changes only if they believe greenhouse gas emissions will affect them personally todays adults even if they will not be around at mid century must think about the fate of their children and grandchildren
9329759 obama can look to his two daughters and mccain to his four grandchildren they are among nearly 75 million americans and 2 2 billion people worldwide younger than 18 that generation will be in its 40s or 50s when one of two things happens either the temperature of the planet warms more than 4 5 degrees and vast regions slide toward being uninhabitable or the wisdom of the next president and his fellow leaders around the world pays off in the ultimate reward survival

9329844 i spent my youth studying various languages reading voraciously and playing the pianoforte i confess that here ends the extent of my gentle breeding i was a naughty child who was forever torturing her parents with countless adventures that they did not deem respectable confined to my room on many occasions due to these misadventures i soon discovered the quill and its amazing power i scribed endless stories that almost invariably surrounded the topic of love for i felt an inane need to be rescued from a family that did not understand my lust for life in my mind king arthur became my true love and i waited for the day when he would come riding upon his steed and invite me to sit at his round table not as his queen but as his knight to my distress king arthur was never to be found anywhere except for in the tip of my quill and so i led an imaginary life for many many years when i finally came of age my family was further horrified to discover that i had fallen in love with an american an american king arthur who became my knight my husband my all i have been blessed beyond reason and am grateful for each day i have with him what is equally amazing is that i now have the opportunity to share my passion for stories with the public the reason why i write romance is because it allows me to touch upon the subject of love on a much deeper more intimate level many of the stories i write many of the stories i will continue to write will always revolve around love and yes gentle readers it will also revolve around sex as i have no intention of becoming my parents and restraining my characters from what it is they truly desire to do i challenge you my readers to let loose of those corsets that have been strung too tightly due to convention and enjoy 1830 to its fullest
9329845 ho trascorso la mia giovent a studiare varie lingue a leggere voracemente e a suonare il pianoforte confesso che qui finisce la misura della mia educazione gentile ero una bambina maliziosa che stava sempre torturando i genitori con innumerevoli avventure che loro non ritenevano rispettabili confinata nella mia stanza in molte occasioni a causa di queste disavventure ho scoperto presto come interessere storie e la sua incredibile potenza ho descritto infinite storie che quasi sempre trattavano largomento dellamore perch sentivo un innato bisogno di essere salvata da una famiglia che non comprendeva il mio desiderio per la vita nella mia mente re art diventato il mio vero amore e ho aspettato il giorno in cui egli sarebbe venuto cavalcando sul suo destriero per invitarmi a sedere alla sua tavola rotonda non come la sua regina ma come suo cavaliere con mio sommo dispiacere re art non mai stato trovato in nessun luogo se non nelle mie storie e cos ho condotto un vita immaginaria per molti molti anni quando sono finalmente cresciuta la mia famiglia stata ulteriormente orripilata nello scoprire che mi ero innamorata di un americano un re art arthur americano che diventato il mio cavaliere mio marito mio tutto sono stata benedetta al di l di ogni ragione e sono grata per ogni giorno che ho passato con lui quello che altrettanto sorprendente che adesso ho la possibilit di condividere la mia passione per le storie con il pubblico il motivo per cui scrivo romance perch mi permette di toccare largomento dellamore ad un livello molto pi profondo pi intimo molte delle storie che scrivo molte delle storie che continuer a scrivere sempre ruotano attorno allamore e s gentile lettrici ruotano anche attorno al sesso dato che non ho alcuna intenzione di diventare come i miei genitori e limitare i miei personaggi da quello che desiderano veramente fare vi sfido miei lettrici a lasciar sciogliere quei corsetti che sono stati chiusi troppo strettamente a causa delle convenzioni e di godere il 1830 al massimo

9329851 i read a couple of her books when i was a kid and in fact one of her books rogues mistress was one of the first two historical romances i ever read i never knew anything about gluyas as a person though i remember being pleasantly surprised to see that she had an inter racial romance in i think it was savage eden at any rate it was the sequel to rogues mistress where a black man and a white woman were lovers they were secondary characters and they both ended up dead p but it was rare to see that at all back in the seventies im afraid i never knew any biographical info about the writer i was only twelve when i first read her and wasnt paying attention to that sort of thing
9329852 ho letto un paio dei suoi libri quando ero una bambina ed infatti uno dei suoi libri rogues mistress fu uno dei primi due romanzi storici che abbia mai letto tuttavia non ho mai saputo nulla sulla gluyas come persona ricordo di essere stata piacevolmente sorpresa di vedere che aveva una storia damore interrazziale penso fosse in savage eden in ogni modo era il seguito di rogues mistress dove un uomo di colore e una donna bianca sono amanti sono personaggi secondari ed entrambi finiscono morti p ma era raro vedere tutto ci negli anni 70 mi spiace di non aver mai saputo nessuna informazione biografica sulla scrittrice avevo solo dodici anni quando la lessi per la prima volta e non prestavo attenzione a quel genere di cose

9329965 the challenge was marrying two different materials woven and knit and two different textures pi a floats and knit collapses and also color blending natural and metallic tones to achieve the luxe vintage nostalgic feel of pi a
9329966 its fabulous and she used a material that shes familiar with its very innovative
9329967 as i have said before price stability is essential to long term sustainable growth
9329968 monetary policy needs to be appropriately tight to stabilize inflation to within the target range over the policy horizon and to help manage inflation expectations

9329970 with greater predictability in the economic environment we can expect better informed investment and consumption decisions which should lead to a pick up in demand
9329971 we are in disbelief that this government can do such an act
9329972 the governments decision shows that the moros dont have the right to their own land
9329973 sacrificing her men on the peace panel to save her own neck
9329974 a constitution should be concise coherent and flexible and more importantly not discriminatory to any particular group especially the minorities the philippine constitution is not the bible or the quran which is not subject for review or correction because they are deemed words of god

9329982 the market is expected to remain feeble as most of the previous economic concerns are back to haunt the market while growing skepticisms are hovering around investors appetite
9329983 in our view trading will continue to be light as shown in the previous sessions and net foreign transactions continue to remain on the selling side due to lack of leads in the market
9329984 however we feel that the market is slugging it out to remain at current levels while investors remain bearish
9329985 this would be ideal for long term investors to start building up their portfolio while share prices are still down and at discount level
9329986 technical indicators are starting to pick up and could signal a positive market outcome this week
