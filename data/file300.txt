3000047 the court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion
3000048 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
3000049 the first notice that the mbta provided that they were going to the court was after they had gone to the court
3000050 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code programs or similar type of information to a computer and does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans
3000051 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case
3000052 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things

3000058 the selection of studywiz spark as the technology platform of choice for implementation in all middle schools throughout the state of maine provided us with the opportunity to improve interaction and collaboration to provide for a more conducive learning experience in the one to one environment

3000060 there was an immediate need for a technology platform on which our teachers students and school community could operate and interact
3000061 with studywiz spark our teachers are taking advantage of the many multimedia capabilities available they are creating and maintaining calendars transferring files regularly backing up assignments encouraging students to manage their work in elocker distributing announcements and posting discussions polls and quizzes we see this as a first step in an aggressive initiative to familiarize teachers and students with the technology oriented learning environment

3000072 huge disappointment as time inc as they were predicting it would be well over 3 million after spending 14 million
3000073 het was al vrij snel duidelijk dat we volledig hersteld waren van onze inspanningen die we in de voorwedstrijd leverden natuurlijk hadden we graag gewonnen en het scheelde ook niet veel
3000074 we werden niet echt verrast door de sterke terugkeer van de bulgaren want dat is zowat hun handelsmerk we hebben de opdracht van coach verdonckschoot perfect kunnen uitvoeren iets langere halen een wat rustig tempo en vooral geen moment voeling verliezen met de koplopers wat in de voorwedstrijd wel gebeurde
3000075 het wordt sowieso een zware race de tijden in de voorwedstrijd lagen allemaal vrij dicht bij elkaar we groeien in dit toernooi en dat kan dan in die cruciale race in ons voordeel spelen

3000082 this is what that 200 year old document really meant
3000083 if a murderer has is a tall man with a mustache is it that unacceptable for a nearby police officer to have raised awareness on tall men with mustaches
3000084 these are terrorists lets detain them humiliate them and illegally search them for no good reason other than people with their skin and religion have committed crimes before

3000103 aber dann hat sich einfach eine unglaubliche freude bei mir eingestellt vorfreude darauf dass wir endlich unseren wettkampf springen k nnen da konnte ich gar nicht anders als strahlen ich habe heike st ndig angestrahlt
3000104 ditte hat mir durch das anl cheln ein gutes gef hl geben da ist der funke dann auch bergesprungen
3000105 ich helfe mir im wettkampf mit lachen andere sind vielleicht mehr in sich gekehrt
3000106 ich bin eher die entspanntere heike ist ein bisschen hibbelig
3000107 solche weltrekorde kann man ja nur schwimmen wenn der k rper ausgeruht ist aber einer wie phelps schwimmt ja in peking st ndig weltrekorde der hat ja bei seinem programm gar keine pause wie regeneriert der sich
3000108 ein normaler trainer kann das nicht mehr erkl ren solche entwicklungen kann nur noch ein mediziner oder physiologe erkl ren
3000109 that is the only puff of dust ive gotten all day
3000110 the most extreme example of a policy in which the end appeared to justify any and all means including torture and murder
3000111 the arrest is not recorded in the daily log which includes the names of all criminals arrested on a given day there is no official record of the arrest or detention
3000112 admitted to not having obtained the signatures or thumb impression of bagicha singh in proof of his having been actually produced before her
3000113 in a made up manner after taking advice from persons with ex top of page 281 perience in procedural law
3000114 it is important to notice in this connection that in case fir no 73 of police station garhshankar and fir no 60 dated 5 8 92 of police station sadar hoshiarpur bagicha singh was not named as an accused and the crimes of those cases were stated to have been committed by unidentified persons
3000115 i just sit there i dont even know when they call the case he the lawyer takes another date and i have no idea prem singh used to go to the courts
3000116 its not easy for women i feel shame they say to one who top of page 282 hasnt seen your back youve shown your face i say that we should be finished with this my will is broken
3000117 a remedy that gave more pain to people than relief
3000118 when the police tried to nab those who are not innocent
3000119 what about the life and liberty of those killed by the militants and terrorists it is not possible to separate the militants from the innocent people who were killed
3000120 not by denying the charges but by countering that the sikh militants have themselves been responsible for abuses
3000121 the convention was that when a matter is referred like this the two judges who heard the case originally are part of the five judges but this time they excluded me and they did not allow the inquiry to be held by the cbi
3000122 the high court was wholly unjustified in closing its eyes and ears to the controversy which had shocked the lawyer fraternity in the region for the reasons best known to it the high court became wholly oblivious to the patent facts on the record and failed to perform the duty entrusted to it under the constitution
3000123 it is better to die than live in this shame
3000124 in the press weve been called agents of terrorists or foreign interests or the murderers of sandhu the judges have also tended to take that view that were basically troublemakers
3000125 photographs were arranged but could not be enlarged as the negatives were found defective due to some technical defect in the camra sic as stated by the photographer
3000126 the directions sought by the petitioner cannot be printed in view of the categorical stand of the state that mandeep singh and harvinder singh were killed in a genuine encounter
3000127 if the witness cannot remember the date of birth of her eldest son other children and the top of page 289 date of her own marriage then it was difficult for her to remember the date of the visit of the police officials to the house of lakhbir singh
3000128 if a man has kith or kin who have been detained illegally he will rise to the high court like anything people are very vigilant of their rights
3000129 so one day before the hearing he got my son knocked down by a car outside the house he was ten years old i have a case registered against him and it is pending in the high court
3000130 the sikh lawyers avoided us a bit because they didnt want to be labeled as terrorists either the other lawyers hated us they openly said we are terrorists anti national
3000131 they felt it is too shameless not to protest even such a heinous act
3000132 the minimal role that it could play in response to those directions
3000133 neither conducted any detailed examination in these cases on merits nor did it admit its liability
3000134 it does not matter whether the custody was lawful or unlawful or the exercise of power of control over the person was justified or not and it is not necessary even to identify the individual officer or officers responsible concerned
3000135 causing a feeling of loss of governance in the minds of the people
3000136 can be established that the court proceedings were not impartial or independent and were designed to shield the accused from criminal responsibility or the case was not diligently prosecuted
3000137 the complaints of heinous nature like murder abduction rape etc can be taken cognizance of in the criminal courts in india without any limitation standing in the way
3000138 put before the people people should know this for sure what justice this court gives us
3000139 i have no hope in ten to fifteen years we will also sit down and give up how much can we do
3000140 here in punjab it was a small army police of about eighty thousand people fighting and they lost a few thousand of them and then just because in such a situation of war there will be excesses any way will have excesses here because we have the rule of law they are reopening this

3000158 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3000159 during the asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi
3000160 we are trying to explore whether we might use only lahore and karachi and take a decision soon
3000161 it was a very constructive meeting very informative the attitude and willingness of the pakistan government officials to implement security measures was very positive
3000162 we all shared the same concerns we have to ensure the safety of the players the media and the concerns were all common
3000163 we believe some retailers are either taking inadequate precautions to assure that fuel containing greater than 10 ethanol is not dispensed into motor vehicles and engines certified for gasoline only or are selling fuel labeled as gasoline that actually contains greater than 10 ethanol in violation of the clean air act

3000241 we welcome the publication of this important report which deals with the vital issues surrounding the provision of healthcare for people with complex specialised needs
3000242 the welfare of our patients is paramount in everything we do if there are ways in which we can improve the simple answer is that we will do so without hesitation
3000243 we are now looking into whether any of our members have been affected in this way and will be sending out a survey in our newsletter next month
3000244 i think death by indifference is a much needed and slightly overdue campaign and there will be many other cases that now come to light
3000245 for carers and those individuals involved i think they will now be more aware of the issue and will be looking into the aspects of their care more
3000246 it is now as clear as day that this should not be happening and i think people will now stand up to the nhs more and demand what they are entitled to

3000254 my mother was a charter member i went to church and school with several current members and many were role models for me as i grew up individually and collectively its members have been the driving force behind projects that have enhanced our lives for over half a century
3000255 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
3000256 we feel without that our history is being cut short
3000257 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
3000258 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
3000259 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
3000260 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
3000261 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
3000262 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
3000263 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
3000264 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
3000265 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city

3000267 fights and even deaths when patrons sang out of tune
3000268 i had a very good start and tried to pull a gap on nico
3000269 especially in the beginning there were many yellow flags and nico was very quick therefore i couldnt pull away towards the end of the race my tyres werent in the best condition anymore and i concentrated on driving victory home
3000270 my start wasnt great as my tyres didnt get any grip on the white line
3000271 on the first laps of the race i was still confident however there were many yellow flags which made it impossible to attack the longer it took the more difficult it became to put jules under pressure as my tyres lost grip
3000272 we will not be making any conditional offers based on a in its first year we always like to see how new grades or qualifications play out
3000273 we are not looking to do any social engineering if it becomes apparent that a grades are a good indication of aptitude for oxford courses we will be very interested in looking at them
3000274 also with any new grades and qualifications we are interested to see how they correlate with our own selection procedures such as aptitude tests and interviews
3000275 dynamic that might make it more difficult for research intensive universities to maintain a balanced intake between applicants from different backgrounds such as those from private and state funded schools and colleges
3000276 its going to be canadian its going to be canada
3000277 we certainly want to be able to accomplish for canada what i think the opening ceremonies accomplished for china
3000278 id like every canadian to be inspired by the opening to the 2010 winter olympic and paralympic games id like the world to feel they know a little bit more about canada as the opening ceremonies close
3000279 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world of what were going to be in the 21st century
3000280 the opening ceremonies that have been the most successful are the ones that either define or redefine the culture in way that brings pride to the national audience and a greater understanding of the essential elements of the culture of the host country to the global audience
3000281 literally thousands and thousands of people are volunteering here they are incredibly hospitable they want to help everybody in every way they can they just couldnt be better representatives of china
3000282 i was here in may the difference between transportation now and then is just like night and day its amazing the way they transformed the city

3000301 las palabras museo y mausoleo tienen mucha cercan a ling stica pero total lejan a funcional el museo hoy es ante todo un centro vivo en permanente efervescencia social ste no puede convertirse en mera escenograf a sino en testimonio de un pasado pero tambi n de un presente el concepto de patrimonio cultural engloba lo material y lo inmaterial de manera indisoluble los testimonios del pasado nutren la cultura viva la que se respira en cada ma ana en cada ritual en cada fiesta si bien los objetos son mudos es el hombre el que les da significado y valor esa es la nueva funci n del museo vivo
3000302 son las nuevas generaciones las que le dan significado y valor a los hechos pret ritos por eso hoy se abre paso una corriente que pretende superar los mudos dep sitos de objetos y convertirlos en verdaderos centros de interpretaci n una mesa seguir siendo una mesa pero si en ella se firm un acto trascendente ella adquiere un valor simb lico que es necesario dotar de contenidos esa mesa habla de libertad de sacrificios por obtenerla de un momento crucial de nuestra historia es funci n del museo dar y comunicar esa interpretaci n hacer hablar los objetos de manera pr ctica y pedag gica

3000312 support a worthy purpose of spotting and promoting new blogs that are making great waves out there
3000313 dr bruce ivins is innocent and that all the scientists who worked with him know he is innocent
3000314 dr ivins has 30 years of service in protecting human life
3000315 dr ivins did not make weaponized anthrax did not know how to make weaponized anthrax and did not have the equipment to make weaponized anthrax
3000316 none made weaponized anthrax none know how to make it nor do any have the equipment to make it
3000317 fbi harassment has been totally awful and its disgusting the way the scientists were treated
3000318 two doctors who came over from the soviet union and work at the facility think the fbis behavior is worse than the kgb
3000319 dr ivins was driven crazy and racked with fear from the fbi harassment which amounted to psychological torture
3000320 dr ivins innocent and doesnt know who sent the anthrax
3000321 our government has requested the removal of all our forces but we are still waiting for the flight schedule

3000324 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
3000325 i invite the international community and the countries with most influence in the current situation to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution
3000326 we are disappointed that strike action is being threatened by the rmt regarding local disputes with lu that are already being progressed through existing procedures

3000328 pada satu kesempatan saya ditantang oleh seorang teman untuk mendapatkan nomor telepon sprint foncard nya ia mengatakan akan membelikan makan malam jika saya bisa mendapatkan nomor itu saya tidak akan menolak makan enak jadi saya berusahan dengan menghubungi customer service dan perpura pura sebagai seorang dari bagian teknologi informasi saya tanyakan pada petugas yang menjawab apakah ia mengalami kesulitan pada sitem yang digunakan ia bilang tidak saya tanyakan sistem yang digunakan untuk mengakses data pelanggan saya berpura pura ingin memverifikasi ia menyebutkan nama sistemnya
3000329 setelah itu saya kembali menelepon costumer service dan dihubungkan dengan petugas yang berbeda saya bilang bahwa komputer saya rusak dan saya ingin melihat data seorang pelanggan ia mengatakan data itu sudah berjibun pertanyaan siapa nama anda anda kerja buat siapa alamat anda dimana yah seperti itulah karena saya kurang riset saya mengarang nama dan tempat saja gagal ia bilang akan melaporkan telepon telepon ini pada keamanan
3000330 karena saya mencatat namanya saya membawa sorang teman dan memberitahukannya tentang situasi yang terjadi saya meminta teman itu untuk menyamar sebagai penyelidik keamaman untuk mencatat laporan dari petugas customer service dan berbicara dengan petugas tadi sebagai penyelidik ia mengatakan menerima laporan adanya orang berusaha mendapatkan informasi pribadinya pelanggan setelah tanya jawab soal telepon tadi penyelidik menyakan apa informasi yang diminta penelepon tadi petugas itu bilang nomor foncard penyelidik bertanya memang berapa nomornya dan petugas itu memberikan nomornya oops kasus selesai

3000347 democracy is resilient but it is not irreversible protecting the values of democracy human rights and the rule of law which define and safeguard our freedom requires constant effort and vigilance this has always been the philosophy behind the council of europe work with young people the objective is not to tell young people what to do and what to believe in but to create the circumstances in which they can make up their own minds set their own objectives and act to achieve them the values of a truly free and democratic society must be embraced they cannot be imposed
3000348 timor leste is moving towards a consolidated peace and stability the undaf is the road map that will guide our direction over the next five years
3000349 it shows that timor leste is moving into a more stable phase that enables it to address the need for strong efficient and effective institutions and improve the lives of its citizens throughout the country
3000350 despite the best efforts of the government and its partners timor leste has not experienced significant progress in poverty alleviation or in the achievement of the millennium development goals
3000351 since they could not obtain the old age grant most men in need tended to apply for the disability grant
3000352 i would urge everyone to read the document and have their say
3000353 it is clear we must act now to ensure there is a place for people to live and work in the future and it is crucial that local people and businesses have a major say in this
3000354 we need to provide homes for everyone and especially homes people can afford which means they can stay and work in the area we also need a vibrant and successful economy for the prosperity of the whole of the district
3000355 planning for the future of the district will help us achieve that and that is why everyones views are so important
3000356 this study offers a step by step approach to ensure that the new economic assessment duty on local government will add value in london boroughs it is important that the duty is more than a paper exercise it should support and enhance real gains in each of londons diverse communities creating a common language for collecting and analysing data will help london boroughs to work better together and increase local influence on pan london and national policy
3000357 londons economic prosperity is not shared by many communities across the capital
3000358 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
3000359 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3000360 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
3000361 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
3000362 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons
3000363 council trading standards teams are already taking a tough stance on shops selling knives to children and carry out regular checks to make sure retailers arent breaking the law
3000364 the legal age for buying a knife was raised from 16 to 18 last year and its important that retailers understand the implications of breaking the law councils arent trying to hoodwink retailers and will only use volunteers who look under 18 there is simply no excuse for selling knives to children and retailers must accept their share of responsibility if we are to keep our streets and our young people safe and free of knives
3000365 recreate 68 organization are decrying the new law in denver about
3000366 the consumer council for water together with other industry bodies asked thames consumers what they want from the company between 2010 and 2015
3000367 thames water plans also need to take account of significant population growth in an area already classed as water stressed by the environment agency we agree with thames proposal for a new reservoir as consumers in the area have told us that a safe reliable service was important to them
3000368 however we believe that customers will be concerned with price rises on this scale especially in light of many other household bill increases
3000369 we are concerned about the impact that thames intensified metering programme will have on certain groups of customers
3000370 the proposal of high price increases and more water meters combined with the rising cost of energy bills could hurt many households
3000371 in the current economic downturn people are asking harder questions about the quality and value of new homes the peterborough ppod homes not only respond to climate change they will also be more spacious and have lower energy bills this isnt just about eco living it is about making new housing schemes a much better deal for owners and tenants by creating comfortable and cost efficient homes for a range of incomes
3000372 to be appointed as preferred developer for the peterborough carbon challenge site is fantastic news gentoo homes aims to create sustainable communities in every sense and has always advocated a
3000373 this scheme provides a very exciting opportunity to bring new types of housing to a major development providing a model that can be transferred to future sites this is in keeping with morris long standing commitment to sustainable development which saw morris recently named as the uks first green housebuilder of the year
3000374 the exciting carbon challenge scheme will enhance peterboroughs reputation as a uk leader in high quality sustainable development and it will stimulate progress in our vision for the much larger south bank area council officers are identifying new and sustainable ways of providing sustainable essential services for residents when it is built
3000375 eeda is delighted that this exciting project is moving into the next stage of development peterboroughs carbon city challenge it will create homes and business premises that are energy efficient and sustainable creating a double benefit of saving the residents money and reducing the regions carbon emissions it will be an exemplar project which will draw on and expand the expertise of the regions environmental technology businesses creating jobs and raising skills and helping them maintain their global competitiveness in a sector that is estimated to be worth billions in a just a few years time
3000376 i have today had a number of calls with international colleagues there is widespread concern about the escalating violence in georgia
3000377 british representatives on the ground and the media have reported that russia has extended the fighting today well beyond south ossetia attacking the georgian port of poti and the town of gori while abkhaz forces have been shelling georgian positions in the upper kodori valley i deplore this
3000378 the immediate priority for the international community is to stop the conflict
3000379 our message today is simple dont bury your head in the sand the right help at the right time can make the difference between losing your home and keeping it
3000380 being in debt can bring misery to a lot of people but losing your home on top would be harder still that is why i am so pleased to see a scheme that stops people from sliding into deeper and deeper debt

3000408 when they joined the council of europe georgia and russia pledged to achieve a political and non violent resolution of the conflict in south ossetia the very serious events of the past few hours represent a flagrant violation of those commitments and the risk of the conflict spreading to other parts of georgia cannot be excluded
3000409 everyone has a right to wholesome water and in england we have some of the best tap water in the world with over 99 per cent of public water supplies meeting drinking water standards
3000410 for private supplies though water quality varies much more widely and typically around 50 per cent of private supplies meet the standards
3000411 these proposals will help to ensure that water from private supplies is clean and safe and that people can consume it with confidence and without risk to their health

3000416 the humidity here is incredible its like 100 it creates a haze that makes it hard to even see i had practice at 10am this morning and they had to turn the lights on because its so foggy you cant see across the court its going to be very tough conditions during the matches unfortunately my thumb is still painful and i cannot practice i am still having laser treatment on it but its very frustrating not being able to prepare as i would like i just hope it heals very soon

3000419 he did his work he never was told what to do but he never hurt himself with the knife
3000420 protests the issuance of a press release that has patently been motivated by a desire to ride the crest of the wave of current public opinion adverse to agri processors
3000421 when you work many hours many days in the cold and it is warm outside it is very hard
3000422 maybe the closest thing to a good that ive seen out of this has been that it revealed how badly people were treated at agriprocessors
3000423 its like out of a ghost story but its true
3000424 fortunately people often say yes or agree with requests out of mindless compliance
3000425 they are frequently willing to say yes automatically without thinking first it makes their lives simpler and smoother but what most of us are trying to overcome is the opposite phenomenon when theyve programmed themselves to say no without thinking about it

3000429 for foreign funds equity is definitely no longer the preferred asset class
3000430 they are quite wary of it and indian ipos do not fit their strategy now
3000431 it all depends on market sentiment there is clearly a flavor for public sector stocks but pricing is the key
3000432 will a large ipo be subscribed yes but the question will be is there anything left on the table for investors to make money after the listing
3000433 there is a wariness towards taking fresh positions in indian offerings
3000434 it is not the business of the law to make anyone good or reverent or moral or clean or upright
3000435 this morning bob bowman had said the french was saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash

3000440 lo que nosotros le pedimos al bce y las autoridades econ micas es que restablezcan los mercados de financiaci n que lo hagan aquellos que deben garantizar la estabilidad
3000441 los mercados de financiaci n deben ser como la m 30 v as de circulaci n r pida y eficaz pero si esas autopistas est n inhabilitadas porque varios autobuses se han averiado habr que sacarlos de ah o repararlos para que los coches vuelvan a circular
3000442 justo lo que corresponde en proporci n al tama o
3000443 la crisis es internacional y nada tiene que ver con nuestros sistemas de gesti n ni con nuestros procedimientos ni con la forma de actuar del supervisor
3000444 que transmita a los agentes econ micos nacionales e internacionales una clara y decidida actuaci n
3000445 son insuficientes dadas las necesidades reales de las empresas y de la econom a espa ola
3000446 aquellas medidas que sean necesarias para actuar con la mayor claridad y rapidez posible
3000447 it makes me really happy because i think about all the amazing things that fencing has given to me the opportunity to travel all over the world to make friends that i never would have met not only all over the country but all over the world to go to the olympics
3000448 if other people can have that because they see fencing on tv and they decided they can try it and just learn about it a little bit id be satisfied
3000449 i hope it boosts the popularity in america even more
3000450 in 10 years in fencing id like to see well established clubs throughout the nation maybe some high school programs or even some grade school programs getting kids started young
3000451 i had to prove that i really am the type of fencer that i want to be and hopefully the next generation can aspire to do the same
3000452 i love being on the strip and knowing exactly what im going to do and being able to do it perfectly no matter what my opponent does
3000453 i love that ability to confuse my opponent i love the game aspect of it
3000454 its really my favorite event because its something that we do together were representing the u s together
3000455 the team even feels more right its more satisfying in the sense of i dont have to beat my teammates to win
3000456 das spektrum der verunfallten war in diesem jahr bisher bunt gemischt bei uns gab es keine sportart die besonders auffiel auch gibt es keine neue tolle aktivit t bei der alle erstmal hinfallen
3000457 ich pers nlich habe den eindruck dass zum beispiel beim radfahren oder auch inline skaten immer mehr helm getragen wird und das reduziert die verletzungsgefahr nat rlich deutlich
3000458 die negative entwicklung im freizeitbereich ist alarmierend f r uns
3000459 denn die zahl der patienten die nach einem unfall im heim freizeit und sportbereich ins krankenhaus mussten hat sich in 25 jahren von 123 000 auf 236 000 f lle beinahe verdoppelt
3000460 bei den ersten ersch pfungsanzeichen ist es h chste zeit ans ufer zur ckzukehren und eine pause einzulegen sonst droht eine berbeanspruchung des herz kreislaufsystems die das risiko eines lautlosen ertrinkungstodes deutlich erh ht
3000461 viele untersch tzen die anforderungen scheinbar ungef hrlicher gartenarbeiten denn mehr als die h lfte der unf lle 51 sind auf unkonzentriertheit oder zeitdruck zur ckzuf hren weitere 21 prozent auf selbst bersch tzung oder unge btheit

3000466 he said i had two months to live peter said
3000467 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
3000468 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity he said
3000469 he buys fruit out of his own pocket coach bailey said
3000470 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
3000471 xavier nixon loves grapes he said of britts standout offensive lineman
3000472 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life he said
3000473 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
3000474 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line bailey said
3000475 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
3000476 hes gotten them from all the ivy league schools bailey said
3000477 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
3000478 its important for our family as much as it is for the team andrew said
3000479 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
3000480 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play he said
3000481 what were doing is saving infants who probably would have been stillborn before
3000482 now were saving them at earlier and earlier gestational ages providing intensive care and some of them make it and some of them dont
3000483 over time the american diet lifestyle health behavioral risks all of those things add up and erode that advantage they started with
3000484 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3000485 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3000486 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3000487 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3000488 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3000489 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3000490 it seems like an infant loss isnt as tragic to the general population as an older child or a teenager people dont understand why youre grieving because you didnt know the baby anyway you havent been able to make memories with them
3000491 nuestro error ha sido no contar con que pod a haber retrasos en la entrega del avi n

3000496 debe ser la comunidad m s beneficiada por el nuevo sistema de financiaci n
3000497 mi mayor preocupaci n es que en este proceso que se ha abierto de mejorar el sistema de financiaci n general baleares sea la comunidad aut noma que sea m s beneficiada porque en estos momentos es la m s perjudicada
3000498 de la apertura de este proceso debe salir una buena soluci n para baleares sin perjuicio de que deber ser un acuerdo multilateral con todas las comunidades
3000499 que se cumplan todos y cada uno de los requisitos
3000500 una voluntad de dar soluci n a los graves problemas que est creando este sistema de financiaci n
3000501 es la m s perjudicada y a bastante distancia de otras comunidades aut nomas
3000502 hasta ahora todas las manifestaciones de los principios que deben inspirar el nuevo sistema de financiaci n y la sensibilidad hacia baleares al reconocer que es la comunidad m s perjudicada tanto desde el ministerio de econom a como del presidente zapatero han sido claras y contundentes
3000503 esperaremos a la negociaci n bilateral y sobre todo a conocer el dinero que se destina a dar respaldo a los principios que deben inspirar el nuevo sistema de financiaci n
3000504 esto no va a ser de este modo porque va a continuar con lo mismo en jerez
3000505 si la obra no desaparece contin a y as va a ser
3000506 nos hemos endeudado mucho con unos tipos de inter s muy bajos y ahora nos va a costar desendeudarnos todos los s ntomas apuntan a que la situaci n es muy seria y que habr que adoptar medidas de manera coordinada con las comunidades aut nomas

3000517 there are no easy games when you go into the olympics we always respect every single opponent
3000518 if we want to win the gold we will have to play the top teams eventually
3000519 we cant think about which team well face in the next round
3000520 we know that nothing has been decided yet in group play
3000521 a victory against the united states will kick start soccer in new zealand
3000522 the u s team has a lot of quality but they are beatable they are definitely beatable
3000523 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is
3000524 we have 180 minutes now and get 90 more against new zealand so we will improve our game from one game to another
3000525 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3000526 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds

3000600 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country

3000793 near term the inflation outlook is pretty bleak as higher utility and food prices come through meaning the boe will remain hawkish for some time

3000799 n s vamos estar totalmente mobilizados para o gre nal a necessidade do inter a de fazer grandes jogos vamos com for a total sempre n o importando qual a competi o
3000800 precisamos da vit ria pra equipe se recuperar e nada mais gostoso do que um cl ssico vamos buscar essa vit ria no gre nal para que o torcedor que est desconfiado do time volte a acreditar em n s
3000801 eu sei o tamanho que o gre nal j vivi nos dois lados sei da import ncia e da grandeza do jogo
3000802 were incredibly proud of our online community who stepped forward to collaborate discuss and draw out the most effective ideas in this issue regarding human dignity
3000803 we wondered if the topic of slavery would be so sensitive or taboo that it might endanger people doing the work
3000804 thanks to this competition we have found some new partners and programs to work with and the prize will help us buy sewing machines and pay wages to the survivors
3000805 the abolitionist movement is still small and the competition provided a great opportunity for little known but amazing programs to let the world know about their work
3000806 a lot of times folks on the ground with a great innovation that has impact dont have time to showcase it
3000807 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3000808 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3000809 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3000810 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
3000811 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
3000812 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
3000813 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
3000814 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
3000815 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
3000816 and to the angel of the congregation in la o di ce a write these are the things that the amen says the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation by god currently we have 225 songs in our song book

3000839 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world of what were going to be in the 21st century
3000840 the opening ceremonies that have been the most successful are the ones that either define or redefine the culture in way that brings pride to the national audience and a greater understanding of the essential elements of the culture of the host country to the global audience
3000841 literally thousands and thousands of people are volunteering here they are incredibly hospitable they want to help everybody in every way they can they just couldnt be better representatives of china

3000844 i feel bad for him because he came in and worked really hard and was going to push for a lot of playing time
3000845 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment

3000847 in der 250er war ich hier auf dem podest und voriges jahr haben wir gewonnen also sollten wir wieder ein gutes ergebnis holen wenn die maschine weiter so gut ist wie zuletzt
3000848 wir haben in der weltmeisterschaft noch einige punkte aufzuholen was nicht leicht sein wird aber das ganze team arbeitet so hart und wir werden unser bestes geben was danach passiert passiert einfach
3000849 dieses jahr haben sie neuen asphalt drauf gemacht also wird das f r alle neu wir werden sehen ich hoffe wir k nnen weiter so gut arbeiten wie in deutschland und amerika aber diesmal auch mit einem guten ergebnis im rennen die strecke passt jedenfalls zu unserer maschine also sind die erwartungen hoch

3000853 it shows how extraordinarily easy it is for many sorts of people now to think of their essential selves as something discontinuous with the body which roots them in the evolutionary process
3000854 only matters because of what will happen when it is actualized
3000855 when we turn to more abstract structural properties like self consciousness it is much harder to know what counts as proof
3000856 there is the same sort of difficulty over what we mean by conceptual thought of course its higher reaches are exclusive to man no other animal thinks about relativity or even social theory
3000857 just what could be expected to evolve when a highly social creature becomes intelligent enough to become aware of profound conflicts among its motives
3000858 since kants time these thinkers have stressed the autonomy of morals they have often insisted that it is independent of all the facts recently they have denounced as naturalism and genetic determinism any attempt to find a source for it in the motives innately present in our species such as natural affection they have expanded the notion of agency on to a scale far larger than had ever been claimed for it before they have used a strong language of unconditional freedom pure spontaneous activity a language carefully designed to exclude any reliance on innate tendencies they have depicted human choice as something self creating isolated without a source without a past concerned only with the future as pure creativity
3000859 so i shall sometimes speak of it not as existentialist but as libertarian meaning that those holding it do not just like all of us think liberty important but think it supremely important and believe that our having a nature would infringe it
3000860 this means acknowledging our kinship with the rest of the biosphere if we do not feel perfectly at home here that may after all have something to do with the way in which we have treated the place any home can be made uninhabitable our culture has too often talked in terms of conquering nature this is about as sensible as for a caddis worm to talk of conquering the pond that supports it or a drunk to start fighting the bed he is lying on our dignity arises within nature not against it
3000861 judging is not in general simply accepting one of two ready made alternatives as the right one it cannot be done by tossing up it is seeing reason to think and act in a particular way it is a comprehensive function involving our whole nature by which we direct ourselves and find our way through a whole forest of possibilities
3000862 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

3000871 floodplain development permits cannot be waived and local governments cannot reduce or ignore the floodplain requirement
3000872 obtaining building permits is especially important for those whose homes or businesses are located within a fema mapped floodplain
3000873 residents rebuilding after our recent floods need to know that building permits are based on local codes and ordinances that are enforced locally not by fema

3000888 when i went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square the young me saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands the voices of the nobles were hushed and their tongues stuck tot he roof of their mouths whoever heard me spoke well of me and those who saw me commended me because i rescued the poor who cried for help and the fatherless who had none to assist them those who were dying blessed me i made the widows heart sing i put on righteousness as my clothing justice was my robe and my turban i was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame i was a father to the needy i took up the case of the stranger i broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth

3000913 i saw an opportunity with subway but couldnt believe how wildly successful an independent online ordering system would become i knew that choosing the right company to build upon the success of ordersubway com was essential making a wrong choice could stifle growth at a crucial time i was really impressed with bighollers technological expertise robust platform and enthusiasm for the online food ordering industry and felt it was the perfect match
3000914 online orders from my location have increased and i know its because customers find the process simple and fast the proof for me is how intuitive bighollers backend platform is making it so easy to keep track of business transactions and see how were doing from month to month
3000915 bighollers customer support is unmatched there have been several times when i requested customizations or needed a question fielded and the response has been both knowledgeable and enthusiastic

3000920 during the competition i heard the voice of the president of the korean archery federation in the crowd
3000921 and it gave me great strength back in korea he nicknamed me butter because im so smooth and relaxed
3000922 i was happy to take the point but i was disappointed because i thought we should have won im not so sure a draw was a fair result
3000923 all the lads came in saying well done because we twice came back from behind
3000924 i admire their resilience and determination in coming back from the disappointments to get us a point
3000925 but lets not be blowing smoke up where the light doesnt shine because we should have won testimony to that is the fact their goalkeeper graham stack won the man of the match award
3000926 it was a scruffy game at times played in awful conditions for august and there were always going to be mistakes
3000927 the first goal we conceded was awful and then the second came from a corner which we shouldnt have given away and then should have dealt with
3000928 we worked damned hard to get those two goals back and there was a spell where it looked as if it might not happen when stacky was saving them with his foot his backside everything
3000929 not many teams are going to come to plymouth and get much with their crowd right up for it so to come back as we did was good
3000930 the downside of it was we didnt finish off our chances and we didnt defend particularly well certainly for the two goals
3000931 we suffered from missed chances last season when we missed out on the play offs by two goals
3000932 we should have beaten southampton and ipswich at home and we should have beaten plymouth by more than one goal because we had all the chances but we didnt
3000933 im not going to go all season long saying well done lads when we get a point we want to win games when we should do
3000934 i dont actually know how many saves wayne hennessey made they attacked us and things went out for corners but i dont think wayne was worked too hard
3000935 one or two free kicks against us were harsh given the conditions but overall the referee did well in what was a difficult game
3000936 we had to deal with one or two free kicks throw ins and corners and did alright except for the second goal
3000937 yet stacky got the man of the match and deservedly so i might be being whingey about it because we had to work so hard to get back those two goals

3001001 helping the homeless may not seem as sexy and glamorous as being a police officer or a fireman but working with the homeless really is extraordinary
3001002 having a new homeless shelter director at the red cross is an opportunity for homeless service providers to support the movement of families toward housing stability and greater economic security
3001003 we want to help folks put more tools in their tool box so that when they leave the shelter theyre not only moving into stable housing theyre also receiving tools to help them through life improve their parenting skills and learn how to get and keep a job the kind of tools people want to learn or rediscover

3001013 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3001014 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3001015 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed
3001016 pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3001017 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis
3001018 but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts

3001220 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3001221 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3001222 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3001223 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3001224 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3001225 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3001226 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3001227 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3001228 i regret that some of our partners are not helping us but in fact are trying to impede us

3001240 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world of what were going to be in the 21st century
3001241 the opening ceremonies that have been the most successful are the ones that either define or redefine the culture in way that brings pride to the national audience and a greater understanding of the essential elements of the culture of the host country to the global audience
3001242 literally thousands and thousands of people are volunteering here they are incredibly hospitable they want to help everybody in every way they can they just couldnt be better representatives of china

3001248 come ti piace conoscere una persona a memoria e la routine la monotonia coshanno di bello
3001249 no non parlo di routine monotonia ma di sapere a memoria una persona non so come spiegartelo come quando studi una poesia a scuola in quel senso intendo a memoria
3001250 ma s dai come una poesia come si dice in inglese studiare a memoria by heart col cuore
3001251 ecco in questo senso intendo conoscere una persona by heart a memoria significa come quando ripeti una poesia prendere anche un p quel ritmo che le appartiene una poesia come una persona ha dei tempi suoi per cui conoscere una persona a memoria significa sincronizzare i battiti del proprio cuore con i suoi farsi penetrare dal suo ritmo ecco questo mi piace mi piace stare con una persona intimamente perch vuol dire correre il rischio di diventare leggermente diversi da se stessi alterarsi un p perch non essere se stessi che mi affascina in un rapporto a due ma avere il coraggio di essere altro da s che poi quel te stesso che non conoscerai mai a me piace amare una personae conoscerla a memoria come una poesia perch come una poesia non la si pu comprendere mi fino in fondo infatti ho capito che amando non conoscerai altro che te stesso il massimo che puoi capire dellaltro il massimo che puoi capire di te stesso per questo entrare intimamente in relazione con una persona importante perch diventa un viaggio conoscitivo esistenziale

3001256 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
3001257 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
3001258 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids

3001302 i want to know you i want to know your beliefs i see your actions and i see your fear but i want to know what first of all do you believe and why do you believe that and can you be open enough to entertain the possibility that there are other belief systems that are valid and can live side by side in peace and in harmony

3001332 and the moms of the other first timers for school around here have come to ask if xab could come get their kids and walk with them to the bus stop of coarse he said yes because he is too nice to tell them no and i am just proud of him for being that kid the one that parents like for their kids to hang out with and be around the one that parents trust the safety of their children with
3001333 when i was a kid we used to have church campouts along the auglaize river next to the cemetery and the priest would tell some pretty wild stories about werewolves in the area
3001334 even a man who is pure of heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the moon is clear and bright
3001335 we didnt release it to the news media when we got the first report about a week ago but now were taking it seriously were concerned for the safety of our people
3001336 im inclined to think it might be a local person
3001337 none of the other area towns have had anything like this and in each case he has been seen in the same area of our town
3001338 if his motive is robbery then he is not picking on the type of person that would have a lot of money
3001339 hes coming at people with a club in his hand we think its to the safety of our people to be concerned
3001340 had huge hairv feet fangs and ran from side to side like a caveman in the movies
3001341 when we leave here the moon is usually about a quarter full but about 4 a m when were working defiance the moon is full
3001342 i was connecting an air hose between two cars and was looking down i saw these huge hairy feet then i looked up and he was standing there with that big stick over his shoulder when i started to say something he took off for the woods
3001343 at first i thought the whole thing was a big joke but when i saw how hairy and woolly it was that was enough for me
3001344 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
3001345 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness

3001353 if someone throws a ball and it crashes through a window do we say that the ball broke the window or that the person throwing the ball broke the window clearly the primary mover is the source of the movement and the responsibility falls to this source the ball did not break the window of its own volition it was thrown there is a deeper aspect to this question did the person throwing the ball break the window or was there a primary mover behind this person did god break the window the answer to the question of whether the stone thrower or god broke the window is that one cannot be separated from the other the stone thrower is an expression of the divine it does not act as a separate entity the window is broken and it is also not separate windows break when hit by stones this is the nature of glass we must change our linear thinking to the understanding of oneness that each unfolding moment is the expression of the divine everything that is and everything that happens is an expression of god ing we do not need to await the touch of the divine in order to know this we simply need to open our eyes and our ears to experience what is happening right here and right now

3001359 for many people its hard to understand that but we understand exactly if we dont come back those people will stay in this position forever but if we come back we can make them dream that at the end of the tunnel there will be a light because up to now they dont have any dream

3001362 although web 2 0 is now entering the trough of disillusionment it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications
3001363 later in between two and five years cloud computing and service oriented architecture soa which is moving up the slope of enlightenment will deliver transformation in terms of driving deep changes in the role and capabilities of it finally public virtual worlds which are suffering from disillusionment after their peak of hype in 2007 will in the long term represent an important media channel to support and build broader communities of interest
3001364 following the trend of the last few years many of the new entries on this years hype cycle including microblogging social networking platforms and cloud computing are making their impact in the consumer world before they hit businesses
3001365 other technologies that have passed the trigger where they start to be interesting to businesses include 3 d printing surface computing augmented reality and mobile robots we expect early adopters to start applying these in novel ways and driving new classes of application such as using 3 d printers to dramatically change the supply chain by creating products and replacement parts at the point of need
3001366 the hype cycle should be used along with a planning model such as the priority matrix see figure 2 which highlights the technologies we believe are worth adopting early because of their potentially high impact
3001367 however the actual benefit will vary significantly across industries so planners need to ascertain which of these individual opportunities relate most closely to their organisational requirements

3001403 the power of the jblogosphere taking jblogging to the next level
3001404 im more interested in the complexities of israeli life than in blogging about aliyah related themes
3001405 at first glance the conference seems stacked in favor of orthodox bloggers with right wing political leanings
3001406 i think what nefesh bnefesh is doing is deceitful a true jewish bloggers conference would be both open to all jewish bloggers and far more balanced
3001407 the first international jewish bloggers convention is open to the entire jewish world
3001408 all official bloggers are welcome and invited to join we dont have a prerequisite if youre orthodox or not if you are on the right or left wing it doesnt matter
3001409 who wants to go listen to some carefully hand picked panel discussion where there are exactly equal numbers of right wing left wing girls boys religious secular sephardi ashkenazi theres no end to that kind of madness
3001410 i have the sense the organizers of the conference were going for pro israel pro aliyah bloggers who also get lots of traffic unfortunately that demographic seems to skew somewhat right wing religious just as the actual aliyah statistics do
3001411 one issue that may not be on the agenda that i would like to see discussed is how to increase our advertising revenue

3001435 the price of poultry feed has gone up over the years while that of eggs has stagnated as a result some farmers might be forced to quit the venture
3001436 between 2003 and 2004 the prices of feeds went up and several farmers abandoned the rearing of poultry the sector picked up recently but with the prices of feeds on the rise the farmers may opt out
3001437 the sector is not fully exploited in terms of quality of the feeds chicks price of the products and reliability of supply

3001448 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning
3001449 i showed that im still in form this morning i read the race wrong

3001462 we will not be making any conditional offers based on a in its first year we always like to see how new grades or qualifications play out
3001463 we are not looking to do any social engineering if it becomes apparent that a grades are a good indication of aptitude for oxford courses we will be very interested in looking at them
3001464 also with any new grades and qualifications we are interested to see how they correlate with our own selection procedures such as aptitude tests and interviews
3001465 dynamic that might make it more difficult for research intensive universities to maintain a balanced intake between applicants from different backgrounds such as those from private and state funded schools and colleges

3001478 with all the energy here among us we can create a much more powerful thing to bring back the local komiks industry and its future
3001479 komiks has not died it was just sick and was being abandoned
3001480 kailangan rin isipin na sa pagbangon nito ay meron nag bagong panahon na kailangan na rin nyang sabayan para hindi tuluyang mawala
3001481 sana ang komiks ay di na lang natin mababasa sa mga museum at sa mga libro ng kasaysayan kundi sana patuloy natin itong makita at mabasa sa ating msimong mga palad maging sa mga susunod na henerasyon

3001522 an animal based diet is nolonger sustainable with climate change threatening the planet its ecosystems and the people who depend on them
3001523 the meat industry is up there with short haul flights as one of the most environmentally irresponsible sectors
3001524 we are being branded as children who just wanted to spoil ourselves
3001525 destructive competition among us will eat us all and will lead us to nothing
3001526 but it wasnt until 1929 on the pages of liwayway magazine that the first regularly published comics character was born kenkoy as created by tony velasquez
3001527 its an astounding body of work to see what kinds of comics those filipinos were able to do ive put up an online museum which you can find at
3001528 a lot of these artists eventually found work in american comics at the very end of the 1960s and it was since then and all throughout the 70s did america finally see a huge treasure trove of artists as yet unknown to the western world
3001529 its circulation supposed out ranked newspapers and had nationwide distribution
3001530 back then komiks was a major source of feature films and later on became material for tv shows as well
3001531 ironically the 70s also saw the start of the decline of philippine comics due not only to the mass exodus of artists to america but also to a number of other factors including the declaration of martial law in 1972 where restrictions on creativity forced many artist to leave or retire altogether
3001532 the komiks as comics are referred to here were still popular and financially profitable for the companies but the quality of the comics themselves specially the artwork suffered a marked decline it is a decline that will continue well into the 90s until at last it will collapse soon after
3001533 rafael kayanan was probably the very first us based filipino not born in the philippines to find work there beginning in the 80s and found work on
3001534 it is undeniable that when it was revealed to filipinos in the philippines that whilce portacio who was then just coming off
3001535 another group of artists followed like wilson tortosa rod espinosa carlo pagulayan philip tan mico suayan and lan medina who has actually been around local comics for a while
3001536 except for philip tan and rod espinosa all of us chose to remain in the philippines because the internet allows us to work for american companies but at the same time stay with our families
3001537 concurrently in the us in the wake of artists like rafael kayanan and whilce portacio who both grew up in the us many other filipino americans and filipino canadians in comics began appearing like j torres jonathan sibal cedric nocon mark pajarillo marlo alquiza
3001538 back here in the philippines the old local comics industry has all but died towards the end of the 90s and early 2000s no more comics from those old companies are being published except for
3001539 however in the wake of the decline of the comics industry in the 90s many young filipino artists looking for venues in which to work didnt find any
3001540 bihira pwede makabenta it is rare that we can sell so i sell my comics through conventions word of mouth or online
3001541 our objective is to give opportunity for indie comics also we want to bring in comic artists and companies and make this into a job fair too
3001542 due to komikon these companies have found local artists who can do the job for them
3001543 ive been able to affect the lives of so many artists and people i had one artist who had a congenital heart disease he used the money he earned from drawing to pay for his surgery so i could say that comics literally saved his life
3001544 a lot of comic books are not selling well but it is good enough for us to build careers for more than 100 artists
3001545 a lot of filipino artists seem hesitant or shy to show their work in fact some who attended my local seminars took years to gather enough courage to show their work this is unique in the philippines but i think there is talent here
3001546 artists really need to learn to communicate communication is as important as the lines and drawing in a page
3001547 some artists dont become successful because they dont want to follow what theyre told
3001548 ive been in the philippines for the past seven years back then i was coming here every three months now i come here once a year we now use this event komikon and our seminars to reach out to more artists i have artists working for me all over the world but i have offices in brazil and the philippines
3001549 if other people see the movie and the musical and become curious enough to see what the original material is like thats whats exciting to me because ultimately the musical belongs to tanghalang pilipino the movie belongs to regal for me the book is mine
3001550 the publisher saw an opportunity in the market for young women comic book readers and they wanted to get this message of girl power across and there was no better way to do it than start off with women writers and women artists
3001551 so did the mac fanboy get tired of harrassing you and leave
3001552 mango comics and nautilus comics have their bi monthly comic books
3001553 the group artists den launched the first manila komikon last year and already in the works of organizing this years event to be held in quezon city on october 21 the komikon successfully brought together generations of comic book creators
3001554 a couple of years ago adarna publications one of the philippines successful publisher of childrens books ventured into publishing graphic novels
3001555 gerry alanguilans komikero group has also been busy attending every possible event that will allow them to showcase the great works of past filipino comic book artists gerry of course continues to produce works like
3001556 in the past couple of years the creators from different studios have won recognition from the manila critics circle and won awards from the national book awards arnold arres
3001557 despite all of that the philippine komiks scene is still a far cry from the giant publishing companies found in the us and japan
3001558 im just glad to say that there are very active comic book creators who release new works every year or every two years so that makes the scene interesting all year round
3001559 you can settle down get married and have kids buy a house and a car from what you make working for foreign publishers
3001560 before i create the impression im doing it for the money i love comics
3001561 and of course the attraction of working on those great characters ive had the honor of working on such icons as superman and batman wolverine x men and fantastic four doing
3001562 but the compulsion to create my own characters and my own comics is really strong there is also a great need for me to do comics here in the philippines i want to contribute to the local industry as much as i could this kept me doing my own comics here all the time i had been inking i find it very creatively fulfilling and kept me sane as my creativity served the creativity of other artists for so long
3001563 i had a pet chicken named solano when i was younger i think their paranoid and jittery demeanor is absolutely hillarious i can spend many hours observing them and ill never get bored i keep imagining what kind of things that go on in their minds that make them act the way they do one day perhaps sitting in church as i would many times be in when ideas come i just asked myself what if chickens could talk what if they were intelligent i think theyd be pretty pissed that people had been eating them and that seemed to lead into a huge well of ideas that just keep on coming
3001564 in the sense that what is currently happening seems to be a microcosm of what is happening and has been happening in the overall philippines society
3001565 now anime amp manga have had a major influence on popular filipino tastes and it reflects onto a good number of independent comics out these days
3001566 komiks in the philippines has undergone huge changes in the last 15 years
3001567 those old comics were standard comic book sized and each one contained around ten 4 or 5 page long short or continuing stories written and drawn by various creators
3001568 the kind of stories were of all kinds horror action love stories soap opera sci fi historical fiction including believe it or not westerns biography educational fantasy political campaigns new age suspense and so many more
3001569 strangely enough there were relatively few super hero stories although they are the ones best remembered today
3001570 in the 90s during the decline of this traditional industry a new industry was slowly being born spearheaded by a new kind of comics creator
3001571 today many of the young creators are influenced by japanese comics and publish comics that look for all intents and purposes like japanese comics
3001572 its something i try to change with my online comics museum and various books i plan on publishing including a philippine comics art book
3001573 this new industry grew and is still growing to this day already several notable comic books have been released to much popularity and critical acclaim notable creators to emerge from this movement includes arnold arre who wrote and drew award winning comic books like
3001574 another award winning creator carlo vergara is responsible for the extremely popular
3001575 other notable creators include budjette and ka jo baldisimo for
3001576 obasanjo should not have taken the matter to the world court in the first place without wide consultations with nigerians or
3001577 even if the matter eventually went to court he would have gone there with a water tight legal team that would have argued our case well instead of going there ill prepared and betraying our kith and kin
3001578 to me personally mind you not can i will say without mincing words that what ex president obasanjo did was not only unwise but foolish
3001579 but he has done it and put president umaru musa yaradua in trouble the world court has ruled and yaradua must handover the land and people to cameroon what can do
3001580 the university didnt mind so much if you were gay but if you had brushes with the law out you were
3001581 without his collecting i never couldve done much of my lesbian and gay research
3001582 labadie was alone among university collections in gathering homophile materials in the 1960s it is one of the best collections of homophile literature due to ed and his spectacular and unique commitment to collecting such materials he is owed an enormous debt
3001583 i really learned a lot from him how to make the collection accessible to people and to the world
3001584 he was as dedicated in his personal life as he was in his professional life
3001585 he was a faithful friend and a person im going to miss a great deal
3001586 que no sabes c mo han llegado hasta ah en forma de gr fica con unos divertidos dibujos podemos por tanto ver un espacio repleto por rockeros en el que se ha colado un grupillo tipo

3001588 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
3001589 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
3001590 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3001591 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3001592 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3001593 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3001594 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3001595 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3001596 s una pena que alguns dels nostres socis no ens ajudin sin que tractin de posar nos traves em refereixo tamb al trasllat per avions de transport militar dels eua del contingent militar de ge rgia des de liraq pr cticament fins a la zona del conflicte

3001599 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment
3001600 18 of greenhouse gases are produced by animal farming fight climate change go vegan
3001601 climate change is one of the greatest and most imminent threats that we face and animal famings role in that needs to be more widely known
3001602 a 2007 un food and agricultural organisation report found that livestock farming and industrial fishing currently accounts for 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions this is even more than the 13 5 per cent caused by transport
3001603 we are asking the government to provide information about farmings role in the climate change and to make it an issue
3001604 there has been no statement of the problem and the wider public have no idea of the statistics involved all the major political parties claim to be addressing climate change issues but none of them has addressed this part of it at all
3001605 we dont have any comment to make were just trying to deal with the people on the roof
3001606 while we would like it if everyone adopted a vegan diet we dont believe in imposing ways of life on to people but information should be given and policies considered that could encourage people to change possibly including increased taxes on the production and consumption of animal products
3001607 an animal based diet is no longer sustainable with climate change threatening the planet its ecosystems and the people who depend on them
3001608 while there were those involved in the protest who were sensible and responsible there were also those clearly intent on breaking into the power station to shut it down
3001609 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3001610 the decision to deploy specialist units including dogs and horses is always considered carefully because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest
3001611 there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3001612 most yemeni plants that grow in the wild are drought resistant by nature
3001613 even sorghum and millet edible grains have become drought resistant in the wild
3001614 since mcgreevey argued that he only makes 48 000 per year while he is in seminary the judge ruled him underemployed

3001629 theres no better place to be than in the center of what god wants you to do
3001630 my own people used to say to me you speak like a white woman
3001631 what does that even mean anyway everyone has their way of speaking and living their life no one should be judging and assuming that because im black i have to speak in that hip hop way thats something i prefer not to do
3001632 i always went to private schools bank street elementary columbia prep so i was surrounded by people like me not so much african american but privileged i dont really have a connection to other people who didnt have my lifestyle but my dad is very into helping people from his own community in philadelphia

3001647 how can we connect our software development to our business needs
3001648 if we do it right and were out to compete and its not just a question of reducing costs or a question of how cheap can i make it
3001649 okay we hope were able to compete on this but were going to keep it a secret now what were doing like all the clients on wall street
3001650 no no no its the stuff that makes web applications work
3001651 solved problem they have their shell scripts and make files and theyre happy
3001652 great so i can install puppet and then fire a bunch of people

3001655 okay puppet upgraded ssh last night and ssh is broken on all my machines i wonder if theres a relationship there

3001775 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3001776 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3001777 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3001778 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3001779 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3001780 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3001781 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3001782 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3001783 who are open to doing something on the production side
3001784 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3001785 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3001786 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3001787 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3001788 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3001789 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3001790 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3001791 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3001792 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3001793 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3001794 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3001795 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3001796 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3001797 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3001798 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3001799 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3001800 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3001801 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3001802 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3001803 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3001804 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3001805 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3001806 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3001807 a professional crackhead staying clean on new years oh who fucking cares about blaaaake i thought it was the cheap hit i needed to hold me over until i get some real wino news but i was wrong
3001808 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3001809 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3001814 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
3001815 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
3001816 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
3001817 i saw the explosion in the morning nobody was there to protect me and now were not getting protected
3001818 its messed up here and i gotta work in the morning
3001819 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
3001820 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
3001821 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
3001822 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it
3001823 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
3001824 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
3001825 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
3001826 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
3001827 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
3001828 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
3001829 on the internet there is a punky attitude that disguises itself as sort of an electronic libertarianism
3001830 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3001831 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3001832 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3001833 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3001834 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3001835 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3001836 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3001837 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3001838 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3001839 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3001840 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3001841 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3001842 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3001843 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3001844 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3001845 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3001846 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3001847 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3001848 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3001849 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3001850 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3001851 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3001852 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3001853 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3001854 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3001855 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3001856 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3001857 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3001858 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3001859 waarmee ze de muzikale stilte doorbreekt op 22 augustus verschijnt haar nieuwe album op die dag brengt ook haar man
3001860 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3001861 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3001862 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3001863 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3001864 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3001865 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3001866 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3001867 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3001868 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3001869 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3001870 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3001871 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and texts saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and regional capital tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
3001872 this statement is a lie just like georgian president mikheil saakashvilis statement on the impossibility of using military force in conflict zones
3001873 the georgian side has named some nearby populated areas and towns saying they are being bombed by the russian air force
3001874 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3001875 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3001876 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3001877 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3001878 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3001879 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3001880 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3001881 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3001882 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3001883 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3001884 theyve asked him for a million dollars and i hear hes agreed to give at least 500 000
3001885 obviously when youre talking about donors these are private things i would never reveal information about any donor
3001886 were building a girls school which will bring the best resources from around the world with a specific focus on medicine education and the law and we dont want a brain drain we want to develop the leaders of malawi who stay in malawi and help their country

3001975 we are extremely pleased with the outcome of this funding round
3001976 we have added a new well respected institutional investor to our investor base and secured resources to support the progress of our development pipeline we are now able to proceed with greater confidence that our corporate and clinical goals will be met our expectation is to move the research and development of our compound homspera from preclinical to human clinical trials and we believe that this funding will provide resources needed for that to occur

3001998 it was the biggest tv event ever so everybody was down friday night uniformly
3001999 its a very expensive option but again it would be an option if we were allowed to speak to the lad if that happened then who knows
3002000 but as far as we are concerned we have made contact with chelsea and thats where it lies at the moment
3002001 weve been out of the top flight for 23 years and everybody connected with the club certainly over the last two years has had one objective in mind and that is getting promoted
3002002 being in the premier league presents us with huge opportunities theres a financial prize that everyone talks about but theres also a big opportunity in what it gives you to present yourself to the outside world
3002003 its the biggest league in the world and its the most watched league in the world so the opportunity for the club is immense to push our brand as far as we can and attract a whole new generation of fans
3002004 people expect that if youre a sales manager in the premier league you must have a harder job than if youre a sales manager in league two i think in actual fact its harder for someone in league two
3002005 the job changes a little bit and its about maximising the opportunity and then cementing relationships and developing new relationships
3002006 so that if our time in the premier league is short lived which we have to an eye on were cementing and developing relationships with people who are going to stay with us
3002007 you need to get the balance right between presenting a clean professional tidy brand and maximising your revenue
3002008 were not sponsoring anything that moves but we are looking to maximise the opportunity so were talking to larger companies whove not been involved with us in the past
3002009 its the same with just about everything we do with the big screen the values are higher because the tv numbers are higher and the crowd numbers are higher so you can get higher advertising levels
3002010 the arithmetic changes and that goes for the advertising boards around the ground and around the perimeter as well
3002011 having got to the premier league the revenue we can derive from one led board is significantly higher than in the championship therefore justifying the cost of having them the premier league affords us a huge opportunity
3002012 what were now looking at for certain games is either developing our own facility or hiring in a facility were looking at the viabilities of different things for instance putting a marquee on the car park
3002013 if i was to pick the one area of the club whose level of activity has gone up the most it is in the media department
3002014 this has happened since just before easter when we were looking like contenders and it was a gradual build of us getting busier and busier until we entered the holy grail that is the premier league
3002015 207 countries it is broadcast to that gives you an indication of the interest on average we have 1500 journalists who travel over from ireland every week to sit and watch premier league football its absolutely phenomenal the overseas broadcasting side of it
3002016 and on a more local level with success everybody wants to talk to players to the manager so were keeping tabs on it to make sure were not flogging it because the manager wants to focus his team
3002017 wha tonton i thought that was the word i can express my feeling easily

3002038 people just cant afford the luxury of a country club its become much more aspirational
3002039 its hard to spend 12 million on a course and make it back at 50 to 100 a round
3002040 if you dont have enough people buying houses fast enough its never going to work
3002041 it was simply a question of the bank giving them money
3002042 it was easy now the market is not there any more
3002043 over a period of time neighborhoods change and improve and we have a real commitment to diversity in our organization
3002044 i think tenants are cautious just about the emerging markets in general
3002045 there is a lack of space and those downtown sites are fabulously expensive
3002046 there was an inevitability that development would move toward noma
3002047 who has a story about how they got here this morning
3002048 there was a lot more early stage talent and ideas than there were vehicles to get them going
3002049 we said theres really an opportunity to create a destination for cutting edge talent and ideas in this region
3002050 will the technology work and will the market emerge thats the quintessential question
3002051 is it going to work and is it going to matter
3002052 the commercial real estate game doesnt work without debt and it is very hard to come by these days on attractive terms
3002053 there is a notable decline in tenant demand but you still have rents at their peak rates
3002054 if things dont change in the economy or things get worse rents will have to go down
3002055 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
3002056 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
3002057 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
3002058 look ill give you whatever support you need including staying completely away from you
3002059 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
3002060 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
3002061 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
3002062 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
3002063 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
3002064 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
3002065 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
3002066 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
3002067 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
3002068 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
3002069 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
3002070 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
3002071 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
3002072 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
3002073 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
3002074 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
3002075 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
3002076 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
3002077 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
3002078 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

3002080 a lot of people think that the younger people are going for obama and like its the popular thing to do and i want you to know its just not the case
3002081 you wouldnt believe how concerned we navy and marine officer candidates are that obama has gotten this far and the truth of who he is and how he views the military is being ignored by the media just so he can get elected
3002082 not meeting one on one with gen dave petraeus when the armys grand architect of the surge traveled halfway around the world to meet with congress obamas turning down an opportunity to visit wounded american soldiers during his recent overseas trip at least he did finally meet with petraeus and obamas refusal to meet with two dozen illinois veterans who went to his office in april
3002083 because the commander in chief sets the mission charlie thats not the role of the generals now i will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics once ive given them a new mission that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out we will not have permanent bases there once i have provided that mission if they come to me and want to adjust tactics then i will certainly take their recommendations into consideration but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief
3002084 we dont need more spin about how the surge is succeeding
3002085 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3002086 i mean i know that theres that little snippet that you tom brokaw ran but there were also statements made during the course of this debate in which i said theres no doubt that additional u s troops could temporarily quell the violence

3002088 branson can delay it but ultimately this is the right course for the industry to take branson would do a lot better if he accepted that
3002089 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3002090 branson should use the competitive threat to his own advantage and do something similar
3002091 its a different ball game now the industry may never be the same again
3002092 slots at heathrow are gold dust virgin would be bound to oppose the airline would be squeezed it would give ba a high proportion of traffic betwen the us and uk

3002102 the cost of lost property is immense not only to the individual but to the businesses as well the service we have connects people together with their lost items the two main items of course being the laptop or the mobile phone
3002103 we started out with stickers key fobs things you can physically attach to the device the more we progressed we designed an application that sits on these devices this essentially creates a network of lost items which then we can connect it all back to the owners
3002104 but all of the time youll get your data back
3002105 so far so good the police love the service the airport police in ireland help out with personal input and experience the national mobile phone crime unit in the uk were a little suspicious at first as many companies have tried this creating a service like this before but nobody has come back with a service that works
3002106 we sell to the consumer but the website isnt too important the website is there as a company placement to get us out into the world our main focus is getting the large corporations in telecoms retail government financials and insurance on side and by working with them we can sell them a solution our big target for next year is to get 10 million people protected
3002107 were very modest we dont think were brilliant its a huge problem globally and its a universal condition humans tend to lose things

3002137 ero l per turismo continua a raccontare la signora daddi sbarcata a ciampino con gli altri connazionali a bordo di due c130 ci hanno comunicato di non lasciare lalbergo vedevamo queste donne che piangevano era una citta in silenzio la nostra ambasciata e stata meravigliosa ci hanno rassicurato intorno a tbilisi cerano i bombardamenti
3002138 un po me lo sentivo vedevo qualcosa su internet ma non credevamo che cominciasse la guerra non sono riuscita a vedere mio padre perche non abita nella capitale ma a kutais e la strada era interrotta ora tutti sanno chi sono i russi
3002139 ci sentivamo come topi in trappola le notizie si accavallavano i pi preoccupati erano gli stranieri mentre la gente del posto tendeva a rassicurarci
3002140 non abbiamo visto azioni militari racconta ancora de marco siamo andati anche in giro per la citt la gente faceva la solita vita anche se erano tutti incollati alla televisione la tv tra laltro dava una versione piuttosto edulcorata dei fatti

3002152 el presidente saakashvili ha aceptado pr cticamente todas las propuestas que le hemos hecho
3002153 tsjinvali est bajo control del reforzado contingente de paz ruso
3002154 actualmente los soldados georgianos disparan espor dicamente a las tropas de paz rusas
3002155 desde irak a georgia han sido trasladados 800 soldados y equipos militares
3002156 la fuerza est integrada por 9 000 soldados y cerca de 350 equipos militares
3002157 las tropas rusas tendr n que tomar las necesarias medidas para obligarlas a que lo hagan
3002158 cu nta sangre oseta debe derramarse hasta que reconozcan nuestras rep blicas esto ha sido un genocidio

3002160 respeto absoluto a la soberan a de georgia y a su integridad territorial
3002161 consideramos a rusia responsable de la entrada de sus tropas en territorio georgiano
3002162 todos los esfuerzos diplom ticos para resolver la actual crisis en total respeto de la integridad territorial y la soberan a de georgia
3002163 apoyamos plenamente a la presidencia de la ue en su intento de lograr un alto el fuego
3002164 le manifest mi grave preocupaci n sobre la respuesta desproporcionada de rusia y le dije que nosotros condenamos en rgicamente los bombardeos fuera de osetia del sur
3002165 fui muy firme con vladimir putin de la misma forma en que fui firme con el presidente ruso
3002166 estaban espiando objetivos militares y preparaban actos terroristas sobre todo en el territorio de la federaci n de rusia
3002167 el total de bajas en territorio georgiano es de 18 muertos incluidos un oficial y 17 sargentos y soldados cincuenta y dos quedaron heridos
3002168 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister

3002172 its not the typical mother daughter thing but were extremely close
3002173 when there is fighting between politicians in parliament there are many explosions in the street
3002174 the iraqi side would like to say that forces should withdraw in the middle of 2010 while the american side says the forces should not leave until december 2011
3002175 the other disagreement is over the immunity of american soldiers
3002176 honestly speaking there is some resentment among the parliament members about the new change
3002177 this new location will expose us to assassination by i e d s or gunfire
3002178 john mccain has said that improving veterans health care would be his top domestic priority as president yet he has repeatedly voted against increased funding for veterans health care
3002179 cant quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment instead he commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
3002180 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
3002181 whats missing is the judgment to be commander in chief
3002182 but i will say that every increase in funding must be matched by increases in accountability both at the va and in congress
3002183 i have had the good fortune to know personally a great many brave and selfless patriots who sacrificed and shed blood to defend america but i have known none braver or better than those who do so today they are our inspiration as i suspect all of you were once theirs and i pray to a loving god that he bless and protect them
3002184 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
3002185 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
3002186 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
3002187 we need to stop hostility we dont need further military action we need to stop it we need to bring back peace and a cease fire is about both sides
3002188 that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
3002189 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
3002190 we have said that this is a condition driven process
3002191 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
3002192 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
3002193 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
3002194 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
3002195 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
3002196 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
3002197 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
3002198 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
3002199 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
3002200 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
3002201 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
3002202 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies

3002206 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3002207 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3002208 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3002209 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
3002210 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
3002211 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing

3002231 with two legs one can achieve speeds of up to 15 mph or in the case of a top athelete like michael johnson 23mph using around 200 steps per minute with four legs we can expect to almost double that speed of course the technique is quite complex and not yet perfected so it will take time to get up to those levels but at least popping to the shops for milk will now be relatively rapid
3002232 we couldnt think of a good word which began with g so we put it in brackets at the beginning of maximiser in order to justify the acronym which had to be leg as im sure youll appreciate gmaximiser means the same as maximiser only a little bit better

3002249 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning

3002258 we believe mac performance is due to several unique drivers that were not present in prior downturns we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
3002259 first apple has successfully reduced the perceived and actual switching costs for windows users looking to adopt the mac platform second apples support of the intel architecture has leveled the playing field in terms of speeds and feeds comparisons between macs and pcs
3002260 finally apples successful retail strategy has broadened the availability of mac products and given apple more control over the critical computer selling process users can now explore the advantages of the mac platform with highly trained apple sales reps

3002324 in 2006 nova scotia became the first province in the country to use gps technology to monitor offenders

3002330 its a little morbid but you wonder why you lived and the other guys didnt
3002331 i was nervous at first but after a couple of hours i just opened up to him
3002332 it felt like i had known him forever we talk to each other every day we see each other as much as we can now hes my best friend
3002333 its like the birth of my daughter its that same feeling
3002334 if you didnt know us you would think my dad and him were brothers

3002341 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
3002342 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
3002343 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
3002344 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving

3002390 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3002391 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3002392 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3002393 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3002394 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3002406 i never really thought of my mom as you know a famous person or anything and like ive never been like amazed at like all the stories because shes my mom right shes just like another person but so like wait what was the question again
3002407 ive seen how much shes been through and one of her dreams shes told me now is she wants me to go to the olympics too because shes going to be really old and i dont want her trying again
3002408 one of the main reasons i want to go to the olympics one day is for her because its her wishes and shes done so much for me so i think i can do something for her
3002409 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3002410 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3002443 os dois lados devem dialogar em nome da estabilidade da ge rgia e os eua e o conselho de seguran a da onu devem ajudar a ser criada uma solu o pac fica para a crise
3002444 following the match against argentina on saturday bakkies botha had a scan and he has ruptured his posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
3002445 we will adopt a conservative management process which means bakkies will not undergo surgery but will rather complete a rehabilitation process
3002446 fourie had a head clash with the argentina wing a scan has shown he has a depressed fracture of his cheekbone and he will undergo surgery before the end of the week which means he will be out for six weeks post surgery
3002447 both players will be unavailable for the remainder of the tri nations and we hope that bakkies will be ready in time for the end of year tour to the uk
3002448 i get the feeling the russians can easily attack us here
3002449 we are willing to sign the document on non use of force and on non resumption of hostilities we need to bring back peace and to stop this innocent senseless brutal absolutely unacceptable killings
3002450 this was kind of like using the hand grenade on the horsefly if you throw the book at this guy then what do you do about there are plenty of guys down there that are really bad guys that need to have the book thrown at them but if you do a 30 year minimum sentence which was the prosecutions request and they would have preferred life where do you step up from that
3002451 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all even when he was captured and the evidence all showed that there was an ak 47 right there in the front seat the guys behind him and in front of him deployed weapons he bailed out of the car and ran
3002452 when he knows that hes in u s hands when he is relatively secure that no one is going to bring harm to him or his family you can understand that the level of cooperation changed and thats very understandable again from our point of view as armed forces members
3002453 it was a framework which we were told to operate in its different from a regular ucmj uniform code of military justice court martial type proceeding we understood that from the get go we understood the judges instructions
3002454 do you really think they are going to take him back with open arms even if he felt any inclination to go back which we dont think he did
3002455 we had an awesome race and we were pushed by the french and the australians i think we all just came together and thats how we were able to go so fast
3002456 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder a thought really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way
3002457 and then i changed i said you know what thats ridiculous its the olympics and im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im just gonna go out there honestly in like 5 seconds i was thinking all these things and just got like a supercharge and just took it from there it was unreal
3002458 i just knew that last 15 20 meters was going to be out of control i just remember sitting there just pounding on the blocks saying the f word just like come on i just remember looking at the finish and it was a perfect touch and i looked up at the block and then i was just ecstatic
3002459 the french team was talking a little trash and you know it fired me up more than anything else
3002460 i think michael knows we did not do this for him he was just a part of it and we were a part of it
3002461 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
3002462 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
3002463 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
3002464 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
3002465 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
3002466 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
3002467 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
3002468 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
3002469 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3002470 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3002471 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3002472 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3002473 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
3002474 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3002475 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3002476 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3002477 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
3002478 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
3002479 we are taking precautions to make sure the racing area is free from algae bloom olympic manager stephen park was in steady as she goes mode but admitted that the third day of racing had not been as happy as the first two
3002480 i am really happy but there is still a long way to go and that first race today was seriously close
3002481 as for the lead well ill just have to hang on to it
3002482 it was tough out there and you really had to be patient
3002483 we are not thinking about the end result it is all going to plan at the moment we are sailing a low risk regatta at the moment and unless we change our game plan we will keep doing that
3002484 maybe a day off will help were used to winning big events and we are used to staying in front of big events but today we struggled in the chop and the swell we need to look at everything and go back to basics
3002485 we started pretty badly with a 19th in the first race but the second was much better with a fifth leaving them 10th overall most people will be up and down this is qingdao this is what we expected a huge amount of this is risk assessment how much you are prepared to take how much do you need to take
3002486 i had a smile on my face and was singing tunes in my head
3002487 but my heart rate was at max nearly all the way through i race every race as though it was the last but definitely this is going to be an endurance battle
3002488 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3002489 ein display sollte nicht nur auf einen wechsel des blickwinkels reagieren sondern auch auf die umgebenden lichtverh ltnisse
3002490 wenn ich ein hologramm einer blume habe und eine echte blume daneben sieht das hologramm nicht real aus all die schatten und reflexionen auf der blume werden im hologramm nicht nachgemacht
3002491 it was kind of boring actually more like executing my training but doing 3 full pieces vs only 2 at a time id never done the actually 3 sports in succession i didnt push too hard or really go for it because i didnt know how my body would react
3002492 viele dieser gene darunter auch myc werden auch f r das zellwachstum w hrend der normalen entwicklung ben tigt
3002493 so sterben beispielsweise tiere ohne funktionelles myc w hrend der fr hen entwicklung
3002494 verschiedene experimente zeigten zu unserer berraschung dass max zwar durchaus eine rolle spielt aber dass myc f r viele aktivit ten max gar nicht ben tigt
3002495 taking action will give you more satisfaction and less overwhelming reaction
3002496 the greater danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss but that it is too low and we reach it
3002497 its all on that guys passport two weeks ago he was still a student in syria he wasnt a jihadi until we came to iraq
3002498 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3002499 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3002500 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3002501 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3002502 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3002503 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3002504 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3002505 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3002506 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3002507 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3002508 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3002509 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3002510 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3002511 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3002512 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3002513 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3002514 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3002515 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3002516 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3002517 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3002518 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3002519 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3002520 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3002521 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3002522 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3002523 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3002524 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3002525 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3002526 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3002527 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3002528 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3002529 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3002530 we believe mac performance is due to several unique drivers that were not present in prior downturns we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
3002531 wheres hayden i miss him and can i watch transformers mommy
3002532 we believe energy crops like sugar cane miscanthus and energy cane are the best feedstocks to deliver economic sustainable and scaleable biofuels to the world this deal puts us at the front of the cellulosic biofuels game
3002533 the german electricity industry has to able to plan today how much electricity it will need tomorrow as well as how that electricity will be produced that is what our system helps them to do
3002534 accurate predictions about wind power allow grid operators to save millions of euros through efficient scheduling
3002535 the amount of wind power used today in germany is so big that all the other types of power plants have to adapt themselves around the wind power output and increase or decrease their contribution depending on what wind does
3002536 harnessing the power of the severn estuary could be an engineering project of breathtaking scale and we will look at the full range of technologies and locations
3002537 the most threatening event for the worlds developed economies since world war ii
3002538 you need to be aware of 2 things 1 am likely to be going into acute unit soon and 2 if you expect me to look glamourous you are on a hiding to nothing
3002539 forcing us to turn away from our original abc strategy in favour of the universal access
3002540 universal access puts emphasis on condoms treatment and a cottage industry of rights like gay rights stigma rights it minimises the role of prevention through behavioural change abstinence and faithfulness
3002541 we used to say aids kills but now when you say aids kills they say you are creating stigma we have a big conflict between the western approach based on human rights against ugandas approach which was based on prevention the social vaccine we have abandoned behavioural change people are no longer afraid of hiv aids
3002542 many referees leave the game because of the comments and the behaviour they have to tolerate from outside of the pitch from parents and coaches
3002543 given how difficult it is for a cell to activate just one gene activating 200 at the same time seems like a very difficult task
3002544 and the way the cell solves this challenge is through positive feedback it keeps all these events in sync
3002545 so what happens is that the very rapid ramp up of the g1 cyclins during start lead to all those target genes getting fired synchronously
3002546 its a function of positive feedback that hasnt been thought of before synchrony and coherence
3002547 by looking at averages previous attempts to find a potential positive feedback loop had obscured what was going on
3002548 by studying single cells we regained the lost information and found the opposite of what others had found that positive feedback drives and coordinates a cells commitment to divide
3002549 weve shown the pronghorns know the benefit of selecting the best males
3002550 now were trying to show whether females can balance the cost benefits of selecting a strong male versus a closely related one will they accept mating with a relative if the projected cost of inbreeding is not too high or reject the male because the cost is way off the chart or will they breed without any regard to genealogy
3002551 i realized we were going to be in an incredibly interesting position
3002552 we now know females select males for their vigor with a real benefit in survival for their offspring but today about three years after the weather caused a bottleneck in the population theyre faced with a different set of choices
3002553 i think theyll be able to discern the best choice
3002554 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3002555 we know you all love to buy anything with our name on it though so you should be happy to repurchase anything we decide we dont want you to have anymore
3002556 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
3002557 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
3002558 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
3002559 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
3002560 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
3002561 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
3002562 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
3002563 the interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming
3002564 our mouse model is a step forward in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and it may help us understand how we age in general
3002565 but the disease is probably much more frequent than previously inferred
3002566 as it is part of a spectrum of disorders with diverse clinical manifestations such as anemia and lung fibrosis
3002567 dirks mutant mouse is the first faithful mouse model for a human telomere disease
3002568 together these results suggest that in patients suffering from dyskeratosis congenita the enzyme telomerase cant elongate telomeres as fast as the nucleases chew them away
3002569 clearly the next step is to understand how telomeres are degraded in human cells
3002570 we need to identify the nucleases at work and find out how they are regulated a problem that will have to be tackled by a next generation of graduate students
3002571 in cases where there is a long history of resistance this is an indicator of death so it is important to try all the possibilities
3002572 probably the largest database of its kind in the world
3002573 the local businesses will see a dramatic amount of traffic just going to the local vendors and stores and fast food joints
3002574 theyre getting ready for this with the extra inventory the extra stock to handle the extra people that will be in town
3002575 i think that its going to be great for business we have the employees in place and weve ordered all the food that we think we may sell
3002576 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
3002577 this brings activity since the start of the year closer in line with our 2008 forecast of more than 200 000 housing starts for the seventh consecutive year
3002578 realmente hay un nimo rec proco muy importante entre los dos teatros
3002579 esto forma parte de una iniciativa del teatro col n de federalizarse de hermanarse con los grandes teatros del interior para poder estimular a las nuevas generaciones estimularlos para el conocimiento de las artes cl sicas especialmente la pera el ballet y la m sica cl sica
3002580 estos convenios no se limitan al mbito de los espect culos sino que generan diversas instancias de exigencia para los artistas y los directores lo que redunda en una mayor calidad de todos los cuerpos involucrados
3002581 if all the sea were ink and all the rocks were chalk if every birds wing were a pen and the sky a single sheet put a pen in the hand of every man of the seed of eve and adam and still theyd leave unwitnesses two thirds of womans wickedness

3002584 bulletin board posts are rather like contributions to a casual conversation the analogy sometimes being drawn with people chatting in a bar which people simply note before moving on they are often uninhibited casual and ill thought out those who participate know this and expect a certain amount of repartee or give and take
3002585 when considered in the context of defamation law therefore communications of this kind are much more akin to slanders this cause of action being nowadays relatively rare than to the usual more permanent kind of communications found in libel actions people do not often take a thread and go through it as a whole like a newspaper article they tend to read the remarks make their own contributions if they feel inclined and think no more about it

3002588 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
3002589 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
3002590 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
3002591 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
3002592 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
3002593 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
3002594 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
3002595 people think i want to hold on to these resources what if something bad happens to one of my kids or one wants to start a business
3002596 coming out of altria the problem was an under investment in the brand

3002598 every food company is being pushed down from a valuation perspective due to commodity price inflation
3002599 a lot of these companies are trading at levels that we havent seen in seven or eight years
3002600 getting rid of post got them to be a much more narrowly focused firm
3002601 while we are not ready to call krafts results in the second quarter a tipping point we admit that there is more upside at kraft than their peers if they can get it right
3002602 this year kraft showed us it can increase sales but next year kraft needs to show that it can increase sales profitably
3002603 we believe some retailers are either taking inadequate precautions to assure that fuel containing greater than 10 ethanol is not dispensed into motor vehicles and engines certified for gasoline only or are selling fuel labeled as gasoline that actually contains greater than 10 ethanol in violation of the clean air act
3002604 theres no question we have concerns but we dont believe overblending is epidemic

3002608 there is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution
3002609 metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non invasive
3002610 in the case of such cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3002611 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3002612 to scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time consuming and very costly
3002613 the fish net structure is counter intuitive because as we stack the material in layers the energy loss is reduced instead of increased
3002614 there is no reason that he should resign everything they are saying is false so why should he resign
3002615 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet
3002616 we gave him a chance to resign we gave him a few months but we have come to the conclusion that now the people of pakistan through their elected representatives in the parliament will have to do that
3002617 the resolution is adopted with a heavy majority and the mandate of the house
3002618 unfit to hold the office of the president by virtue of being guilty of violating the constitution of pakistan and of gross misconduct
3002619 now i have to begin changing my mind and looking into the future as to what the next decade or so will be
3002620 thats really what i in my spare moments think about now how i can do valuable things in the future
3002621 i have served with independence and ive stayed the course
3002622 ive been one of those very naive people who actually believes that this is a profession about very important principles
3002623 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3002624 during the asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi

3002628 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
3002629 14 hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
3002630 the working committee of the constituent assembly announced today that voting for choosing the prime minister will take place on friday
3002631 we want the maoists to head the government but they must give up their rigidness of keeping the home defence and finance ministries
3002632 there is no point in leading a government if we dont get the key portfolios we will have our hands and legs tied
3002633 the major parties are now in agreement that we should lead the government and we are negotiating to share power with congress and other parties but differences remain in sharing out the ministerial portfolios
3002634 we are rolling back the transportation clock 30 years airlines are toast people think nothing about flying somewhere for the weekend to their second home for instance to them cheap fares are a birthright no more
3002635 imagine just two or three at most instead of 400 discount fares to fly from coast to coast think 800 or 900

3002641 the toll of asbestos related cancer first noticed in the 1950s and 1960s is likely to continue for several more decades even though usage reduced rapidly some 25 years ago while there are reasons to suppose that nanotubes can be used safely this will depend on appropriate steps being taken to prevent them from being inhaled in the places they are manufactured used and ultimately disposed of such steps should be based on research into exposure and risk prevention leading to regulation of their use following this study the results of which were foreseen by the royal society in the u k in 2004 we can no longer delay investing in such research
3002642 the results were clear long thin carbon nanotubes showed the same effects as long thin asbestos fibers short or curly carbon nanotubes did not behave like asbestos and by knowing the possible dangers of long thin carbon nanotubes we can work to control them its a good news story not a bad one it shows that carbon nanotubes and their products could be made to be safe

3002647 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research

3002650 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
3002651 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
3002652 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to
3002653 this boy is very young but at a very young age he has to make big decisions
3002654 it is what you make of your talent at some stage you need to have the intelligence to realise what you have to do
3002655 at 16 years old he had to decide to leave his parents and sign for arsenal football club what got him to do that is the tremendous desire to become a great football player
3002656 what you can learn from someone successful is how much he is ready to give to be good
3002657 when you get up in the morning we are always torn in the comfort zone and being the best it is about saying to yourself i want to be the best
3002658 i have been in touch with many great players and it is always about a combination of talent intelligence and motivation
3002659 if one of the three is missing then there is no great career we say that god doesnt give you everything but in some he gives more
3002660 this is a distinct kind of physical connection between two compartments in a cell the cytoplasm and the nucleus
3002661 it really opens up the possibility that there is a basic process going on that affects gene expression in ways that we had not understood before
3002662 the proteins act like players in a game of tug of war
3002663 they will move side to side in an ordered line remaining standing as long as the teams are of similar strengths however once one team pulls with a force that cannot be countered by the second team both teams fall to the ground in a jumble
3002664 this communication is physical and it shows us how chromatin can support a cytoplasmic function while on the other hand microtubules have the ability to affect nuclear functions

3002680 the judge ruled in favor of the georgia tech free speech zone policy and the use of student activity fees
3002681 georgia tech practices are exactly the same as before the suit was filed
3002682 anyone with passing familiarity of the instant litigation would not be faulted for questioning the accuracy of numerous portions of this short press release
3002683 t he courts order on summary judgment certainly indicates potential constitutional pitfalls to the manner in which georgia tech administers its student activity fee program based on
3002684 for whatever reason social conservatives focus considerable political effort on abortion gay rights and obscenity but pay scant attention to divorce
3002685 you used extremely poor judgment by insisting on openly reading this book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your black co workers
3002686 there is no university policy that prohibits reading scholarly books on break time
3002687 beware the people who moralize about great issues moralizing is easier than facing hard facts

3002689 hey what would happen if a heterosexual man did the same to the mother of his children
3002690 we wanted to win the community shield but there are still a lot of positives to take from the match
3002691 we can still improve our game going forward but not to lose after 90 minutes is good
3002692 we didnt create enough chances but its always hard to create against manchester united
3002693 theyll always be favourites and theyll always have the majority of possession but we can give anyone a game on our day and we showed that by not conceding

3002708 the florida democratic party should not open the door even a tiny bit to republican mischief since we know based on 2000 that the republicans will spend millions on legal fees in challenges in order to win
3002709 consequently we must dot every i and cross every t in the proper manner to immunize us from republican attack

3002737 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course and applying myself
3002738 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me what im doing controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil so just pay attention to what im doing and continually try and strive to improve thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3002739 the only thing from experience that i know is that in a major nobody goes without making some mistakes
3002740 so as long as i could hang in there i knew that i would get my opportunity and if it was going to be my day i would take that opportunity
3002741 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or you dont win

3002963 because it was written dead fast and recorded dead fast the shock of the lightning basically is the demo and it has retained its energy and theres a lot to be said for that i think the first time you record something is always the best

3002968 a lot of these companies are trading at levels that we havent seen in seven or eight years
3002969 getting rid of post got them to be a much more narrowly focused firm
3002970 while we are not ready to call krafts results in the second quarter a tipping point we admit that there is more upside at kraft than their peers if they can get it right
3002971 this year kraft showed us it can increase sales but next year kraft needs to show that it can increase sales profitably
3002972 we are rolling back the transportation clock 30 years airlines are toast people think nothing about flying somewhere for the weekend to their second home for instance to them cheap fares are a birthright no more

3002977 in 2005 carter was not as experienced as he is now and you dont go back and look at things like that
3002978 with the amount of games he has played the experience came and that you dont go buy at any checkers on a sunday you just get that from playing under that tremendous pressure that he has been put under
3002979 his tactical and goal kicking in particular is outstanding and he can control a test with his boot he takes me back to the way former springbok flyhalf naas botha used to play
3002980 we tried a few things in wellington and we could never get him off his game and for us to now go concentrate on a guy who is so strong at what he can do would be a mistake wed rather take the support structures out
3002981 i knew wed win that test in dunedin when 14 all blacks were looking to one man carter to win the match for them
3002982 the difference is that we have 15 players here and if we can do our jobs and just believe in ourselves and believe that we are much better at certain areas than any other world team i think we can go far
3002983 piri is a strong bugger but sometimes because that he can overplay his hand
3002984 so it would be great if they played him ahead of cowan
3002985 the boks beats us in the last game 30 28 in dunedin but in auckland we were more structured than we have been in the past we hope to improve and be even more structured on saturday
3002986 under the elvs you cant tap and go all the time
3002987 weve got to control the game to the pace we want it to speed it up and slow it down when we want to it has suited new zealand in the past to go to our lineout and scrum and attack off there well look to vary the pace of the game as it suits us
3002988 the boks may be trying to keep the ball alive a bit more but they still have an extremely physical side to them they will have similar traits to what theyve always had a strong kicking game and they use the lineout well
3002989 weve always played within the laws and well always try to put them under pressure
3002990 its not cheating to get stuck in and have a real go at each other
3002991 i thought the boks did well against argentina last week the beast is going well but so is cj van der linde on the tighthead side
3002992 bj is still one of the best tightheads in the world in my opinion he gets a good hit and gives them a great platform thats not to say the other bok players arent up to scratch but im surprised that bj is not even in the picture

3002997 the dns servers and the site itself have been coming under severe attack
3002998 when bolt ran 9 72 i realized that i had to run a 9 6 to beat him and thats what i trained my mind to do
3002999 the record can go and the guys can go 9 6 i did it with a lot of wind but i feel i can go there without wind
3003000 this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
3003001 i dont feel any aches or twitches ive been staying hydrated and im confident my body will hold up
3003002 i was really upset the same thing happened in 2004 and that memory rose up and started messing with me
3003003 athletes have a tendency to think they can do anything now i definitely know i have to look after my body a bit better
3003004 i guess it should be the world record holder but powell is very confident right now
3003005 there is pressure on bolt and i dont know how hes taking it hes a young guy and he likes to have fun regardless of what he says people are expecting him to win the gold medal im in the back but ive had some good practices
3003006 to have three guys who have run 9 7 i think its amazing and i cant overlook americans walter dix and darvis patton or any of the others
3003007 i think the torch was lit at 12 01 so it was actually on my birthday

3003179 costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again the gift which must be asked for the door at which a man must knock such grace is costly because it calls us to follow and it is grace because it call us to follow jesus christ
3003180 it is only because we follow jesus that we can be genuinely truthful for then he reveals to us our sin upon the cross the cross is gods truth about us and therefore it is the only power which can make us truthful when we know the cross we are no longer afraid of the truth
3003181 all that the follower of jesus has to do is to make sure that his obedience following and love are entirely spontaneous and unpremeditated if you do good you must not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing you must be quite unconscious of it otherwise you are simply displaying your own virtue and not that which has its source in jesus christ

3003202 minister wongs green paper protects polluters and provides no signal for investment for a zero emissions future
3003203 minister wong told australia today that the greenhouse problem is caused by the fact that there is currently no cost to producing carbon dioxide and no limit on the amount that can be produced
3003204 prime minister rudd and minister wong warned that protecting some sectors from emissions trading will put greater costs on everyone else and that is exactly what they have done with free permits to trade exposed industries and payments to protect coal
3003205 emissions trading is about changing investment decisions but the government has taken every opportunity to protect the investments of polluters from coal fired power stations to aluminium smelters to native forest loggers
3003206 the government has included petrol in the scheme with one hand and effectively removed it with the other pretending that the scheme will have broad coverage while really excluding transport
3003207 giving free permits for the aluminium sector and other trade exposed industries out to 2020 and beyond sends absolutely no signal for those industries to reduce their emissions protecting the coal generators and subsidising geosequestration is a decision to lock renewable energy out of australia
3003208 cash compensation payments to industry and householders will only delay the pain and increase it when the crunch comes
3003209 the forest industry will benefit from carbon credits from plantation establishment but will bear absolutely no cost for the native forest logging which sends millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year

3003251 dieser tag soll aber nicht nur auf jugendspezifische themen und probleme aufmerksam machen vielmehr geht es darum die jungen generationen von heute als jene menschen zu begreifen die das tun und handeln der welt von morgen bestimmen es ist daher wichtig nicht nur f r sondern mit den jugendlichen zu sprechen und auch zu handeln
3003252 um ihre zukunftschancen und mitbestimmungsm glichkeiten zu verbessern ist es deshalb besonders in entwicklungs und transformationsl ndern wichtig breiten zugang zu schulbildung und berufsausbildung zu sichern

3003257 the quadrennial review is being done by contractors thats ironic
3003258 i dont know how you would set up a metric
3003259 the number and proportion of contractors is the wrong metric
3003260 many times the number of contractors is less relevant the issue is what is the mission and what are the total resources available

3003277 auffallend ist f r mich auch dass die politik auf den fp vorschlag nach kooperation mit einem low cost carrier zun chst mit schweigen reagiert hat und man dann fly niki ins spiel brachte die angesprochene fluggesellschaft mit standort wien aber keinerlei erw hnung fand dieser umgang mit potentiellen partnern zeigt dass tsch und michaelis der herausforderung des aua privatisierungsauftrages offenbar nicht gewachsen sind und daher ihren hut nehmen sollten

3003361 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder a thought really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what its ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im just just gonna go out there and put it and honestly in like 5 seconds i was thinking all these things and just got like a supercharge and just took it from there and you know it was was unreal

3003369 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
3003370 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
3003371 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
3003372 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
3003373 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
3003374 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
3003375 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
3003376 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
3003377 this was kind of like using the hand grenade on the horsefly if you throw the book at this guy then what do you do about there are plenty of guys down there that are really bad guys that need to have the book thrown at them but if you do a 30 year minimum sentence which was the prosecutions request and they would have preferred life where do you step up from that

3003379 when he knows that hes in u s hands when he is relatively secure that no one is going to bring harm to him or his family you can understand that the level of cooperation changed and thats very understandable again from our point of view as armed forces members

3003428 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3003429 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3003430 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3003431 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3003432 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3003440 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3003441 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3003450 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3003451 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3003452 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3003453 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3003454 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3003455 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3003456 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3003457 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3003458 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3003459 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3003460 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3003461 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3003462 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3003463 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3003464 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3003465 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3003466 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3003467 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3003468 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3003469 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3003470 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3003471 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3003472 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3003473 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3003474 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3003475 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3003476 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3003477 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3003478 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3003479 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3003480 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3003481 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3003482 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3003483 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3003484 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3003485 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3003486 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3003487 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3003488 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3003489 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3003490 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3003491 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3003492 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3003493 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3003494 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3003495 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3003496 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3003497 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3003498 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3003499 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3003500 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3003501 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3003502 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3003503 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3003504 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3003505 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3003506 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3003507 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

3003511 snoop dogg has a lot of fans in india and i love em right back
3003512 its very much a sign of how times have changed in the hip hop world
3003513 mc hammer did a lot of product endorsements he was considered a sellout and not true to his base but now rappers can start their own clothing lines and make all the money in the world its all a part of people branding themselves
3003514 if youre a young rapper and you establish yourself as being from the street and youre on your first or second album making baby clothes isnt going to help
3003515 but if youre 10 albums deep and youre pushing 40 youre likely an international brand its not as much of an issue
3003516 snoop gets props for life i cant think of what he would have to do to get his pass revoked when gangsta rap started to blow up in the mainstream he was sort of the symbol for that he was the icon the rules are different now he can act silly on tv and its ok

3003540 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
3003541 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people

3003546 well first of all if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped and secondly i think the olympics are going to serve as a chance for people to come and see china the way it is and let the chinese see the world and interface and have you know the opportunity to converse with people from around the world this is a very positive development in my view for peace who knows how chinas going to progress they have been through some very difficult political times the cultural revolution for one where the leadership actually created violent anarchy as the society turned on itself all i can tell you is its important for the united states to be active in this part of the world with all countries and to stay engaged with china
3003547 hes made up for every poor swim hes ever had
3003548 that might be the most incredible relay sprint ive ever seen in my entire life

3003559 ive seen plenty of disgusted and disgruntled parents come in with phone bills in the hundreds of dollars for their kids
3003560 and then theres the fact that kids will be kids they play rough with and lose their toys a phone will be no different
3003561 theres a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer
3003562 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones
3003563 we do not have enough information nor do we have enough time to be sure that cell phones are safe and theres reason for concern that they may be harmful
3003564 i was so busy with school and sports that i rarely used the phone
3003565 its just like anything else and you have to monitor it
3003566 during that time everybody wanted to own a mobile phone but it was not common to find them in this country
3003567 sometimes i am in bed and a customer will call me and i will go and pick him up
3003568 there is nobody in ghana who is not using a mobile phone
3003569 previously there were just simply no telephones or there would be a few phones around
3003570 now telephones are available for the masses which is a relatively recent innovation in africa
3003571 i think there is something quite fascinating going on here
3003572 if you give people the opportunity to connect and engage with the economy they will do so
3003573 wireless technology is far more widely used in africa than in europe and the united states

3003578 for advertisers to prosper they need competitive markets we think google is a fantastic company our sense is that if the transaction with yahoo proceeds theres the potential the development of yahoo ad system panama and other competing systems will atrophy over time
3003579 we like to see a healthy market with lots of players and competition
3003580 if this gives more volume than converts its a good thing for advertisers
3003581 for advertisers to prosper they need competitive markets we think google is a fantastic company our sense is that if the transaction with yahoo proceeds theres the potential the development of yahoo ad system panama and other competing systems will atrophy over time
3003582 we like to see a healthy market with lots of players and competition
3003583 if this gives more volume than converts its a good thing for advertisers
3003584 the advertiser will find itself spending more for the same amount of clicks because theyre coming from the most expensive part of the ecosystem
3003585 we dont know how much yahoo is going to implement this
3003586 we think this is making the pie bigger and helping advertisers by making sure their ads are matched better
3003587 what worries me is wheres the r amp d going into the next generation of search

3003594 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
3003595 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
3003596 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
3003597 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines

3003599 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3003600 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3003601 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3003602 it was obvious william was fascinated he asked how painful it was and wanted to know what they thought of his idea for a tattoo across his shoulders
3003603 he said the only thing stopping him was his girlfriend he was worried she would think it was a bit too chavvy
3003604 wow i thought i was the only one to notice that

3003606 the formal uniform is supplied by australian owned mileno shoes and iconic fashion label sportscraft athletes will wear the formal uniform to the official flag raising ceremony in the olympic village and the team reception the uniform to be worn at the opening ceremony will be seen for the first time on the night of the 8th of august the uniform will contain an 08 08 08 theme incorporating the date of the ceremony chosen for the lucky significance of the number eight in china
3003607 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
3003608 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
3003609 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3003610 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3003611 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3003612 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3003613 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3003614 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy

3003617 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
3003618 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
3003619 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
3003620 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
3003621 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
3003622 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
3003623 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
3003624 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
3003625 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
3003626 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
3003627 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
3003628 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
3003629 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
3003630 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
3003631 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
3003632 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
3003633 in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
3003634 i know weve been out of contact well get in more contact its been a busy couple weeks

3003637 every epoch suffers from the disability of being contemporaneous with itself and of having no idea where it might lead
3003638 of form and content become entirely one because the poems language somehow incarnates its meaning whereas language points to things poetic language actually embodies them there is a theology lurking behind this poetics just as the word of god is the father made flesh so the poem does not simply talk about things but in some mysterious way becomes them
3003639 only when words cease to be themselves and merge into their referents can they be truly expressive
3003640 it is as if in the midst of a lively conversation between two friends a maid suddenly appeared to tell the host that a salesman was at the door in the second place i refuse the positions i have taken in the main narrative believing likewise that it is improper of me to dispute things with my visitor in this case the reader in the sala i have thought it best to argue in the backroom in the notes at the end of this book
3003641 what appears in a psychological explanation as fictive threats from within the self turn out to have social and material form the ilustrado ideal of domestic comfort and ease which agoncillo tries to realize in and as scholarly write is potentially disrupted by rude concerns of commerce and petty enterprises represented by the intrusive salesman the narrative which secures the ilustrado subjecthood is conceived as a civilized sala conversation between two friends which mundane economic concerns as well as politically tendentious arguments must be excluded and relegated to the backroom the notes at the end of the book
3003642 psychology is the logic of attachments and sympathetic action which serves as the very methodology of agoncillos history it is not just that agoncillo is prejudiced by prior regional gender and class identification
3003643 the only explanation i have for this conclusion is that the author being based in the university of adelaide had to make his bow in the direction of global capitalism as he also benefits from it the university after all is famous for its ties with corporations and the australian defense industry
3003644 should be analyzed of its process and conditions out of the available discourses ideology masquerading as coherence and plenitude is in reality inconsistent
3003645 limited contradictory and the realist text as a crystallization of ideology participates in this incompleteness even while it diverts attention from the fact in the apparent plenitude of narrative closure it is the mode of production the materials and then the arrangement is the work
3003646 becomes plural open to re reading no longer an object for passive consumption but an object of work by the reader to produce meaning
3003647 belgian writer and journalist who has written extensively on the geo political aims of natos war against yugoslavia and author of two books on the balkans

3003650 supreme court of belgrade had declared the extradition of milosevic illegal but the flemish government or that of brussels carried out the extradition nonetheless everyone knows that the djnidjic government carried out their transfer in exchange for a reward that the united states didnt even pay him
3003651 in 1980 the international court of justice condemned president reagan for having mined the ports of nicaragua with the goal of destabilizing the leftist sandinista government there the us stopped recognizing the court
3003652 it is out of the question that any us citizen can be charged for crimes he may have committed and the us marines would go and rescue him by force no matter where in the world the trial would be taking place
3003653 the masters of the world claim that they are judging milosevic but refuse to judge chiles general augusto pinochet or israels ariel sharon the latter can illegally occupy palestine practice apartheid ethnic cleansing by steps and terror yet he continues to receive billions and billions of dollars and euros and europe doesnt raise its little finger
3003654 milosevic has been attacked not for crimes he might have committed but because he resisted the imf and the multinationals that wanted to control his country the most important dimension of this trial is bush is threatening more and more countries that are rebellious north korea iraq even iran guerillas in colombia philippines underscoring mine and tomorrow still others the goal of this trial is to intimidate all the other third world leaders who follow a course of resistance to multinationals it is a trial of intimidation
3003655 1989 when he tended to introduc e capitalism to yugoslavia all the while
3003656 the colossal price hikes homes deprived of electricity massive loss of jobs
3003657 having utilized islamic terrorists from bin ladens movement to break up yugoslavia and to divide the peoples in bosnia in kosovo and in macedonia even
3003658 clinton blair german chancellor helmut kohl and the us and german secret services for their clandestine work in yugoslavia
3003659 it is as if sharon is judging palestinian premier yassir arafat
3003660 to grant muslims significant governing autonomy and the right to live under shariah law in an expanded area of the archipelagos southern island
3003661 removing muslims from the rest of philippine society and enabling them to shape an entirely separatist mentality that dreams of carving out a pan islamic state from other existing countries in the region such as malaysia indonesia and singapore
3003662 yes i know him hes our faculty center anarchist and seems to have a very good opinion of himself what say you
3003663 of deng xiaoping and many like him who were not really marxist but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see china on equal terms with great global powers they were primarily nationalists and they participated in the communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find to chinese nationalism
3003664 the current rapid economic growth of china and its being transformed as the darling of capitalism are only possible because of the efforts towards industrialization accessible health care and extensive public education during the era of mao
3003665 on the bright side at least the us looked better than most of the other countries like the new zealanders below who look like they were all in some sort of spray paining accident

3003691 members of the openly collaborationist dahlan clans who fled under similar circumstances a year ago in the wake of the hamas preemptive strike of 2007 did not want members of the hilles clan and they convinced palestinian authority prime minister salam fayyad that the whole business would prove too costly
3003692 first under arafat and then in a power vacuum created by israels unilateral withdrawal from gaza in 2005 the 20 odd leading clans reached the peak of their power economic and military social and political but when the clans came up against an elected hamas government something had to give last weekend it did in the first year or so of islamist control of the occupied territories the clans bided their time playing hamas against fatah but when hamas defeated the fatah controlled forces of the president mahmoud abbas in gaza last year the clans began to buckle in the absence of organised fatah forces in gaza some of the bigger clans have become militia proxies for abbas unelected and us sponsored regime which operates from the west bank city of ramallah in the absence of the greater israeli force and left to their own devices by the fatah controlled palestinian authority blood feuds and other clan clashes exploded from a handful in the 1980s to hundreds in 2006 when at least 90 deaths and hundreds of injuries were recorded despite resorting to strong arm tactics that have provoked negative criticism from human rights watch groups hamas is celebrated locally for restoring law and order
3003693 since human rights groups have recently reported on torture in gaza alarms were raised over israels decision to send about 3 dozen hilles clan members back to gaza the association for civil rights in israel acri sent an urgent appeal to the supreme court demanding that israel stop returning the men to gaza on monday morning the israeli military announced that it would not send them all to gaza and that it had persuaded mr abbas to allow many of them into the west bank so acri backed off replaced by two right wing activists who petitioned the court to stop the transfer of dangerous men across israel by days end the army had moved 88 of the men on military buses to jericho several dozen others were sent to gaza while 16 were still in the hospital and the rest israeli security forces were interrogating them
3003694 israeli historian zeev sternhell argues that zionism as a whole was a tribal form of nationalism of blood and soil emphasising religion and ethnicity

3003696 our product fits very well with the chinese we can offer a little bit of switzerland within switzerland
3003697 we have a small historic city and the lake and mountains that are all very close its a little piece of what chinese people think switzerland has to offer quality nice nature shopping culture
3003698 for us now it is about improving the branding of lucerne and the lake lucerne region so that if chinese people travel to europe and switzerland they feel they must come here
3003699 its never going to be a number one market for switzerland but in the next couple of years the number of overnight stays could double
3003700 we try not to be an old fashioned completely swiss style mountain were more of a modern style of mountain
3003701 many others dream about the huge chinese market that is coming for us its already here now its about brand building and becoming better known
3003702 it is nice for them to see but they are interested in coming back from europe with some status symbols like a louis vuitton bag from paris or a swiss watch watch shopping is a very important reason why they visit switzerland

3003707 hai orang orang yang beriman telah diwajibkan kepadamu berpuasa sebagaimana telah diwajibkan kepada orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa
3003708 barangsiapa berpuasa di bulan romadhon karena iman dan mengharapkan balasan dari alloh maka dia akan diampuni dosa dosanya seperti bayi yang baru dilahirkan dari perut ibunya
3003709 can you give me one good reason not to quit
3003710 when i planted the fern and the bamboo seeds i took very good care of them i gave them light i gave them water the fern quickly grew from the earth its brilliant green covered the floor yet nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo in the second year the fern grew more vibrant and plentiful and again nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
3003711 in year three there was still nothing from the bamboo seed
3003712 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just six months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
3003713 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots i would not quit on the bamboo i will never quit on you dont compare yourself to others
3003714 the bamboo had a different purpose than the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful your time will come
3003715 give me glory by rising as high as you can
3003716 this has been a major major thing in my heart

3003718 100 years of ford a centennial celebration of the ford motor company
3003719 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
3003720 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations
3003721 i am completely unaware that zionism ever aimed to rule the middle east zionism simply wanted to establish and maintain a miniscule jewish state in the land of israel palestine the patrimony of the jews conquered by savage muslim arab invaders
3003722 israel has been threatened by iran with destruction and the iranian nuclear project appears to have israel as its target
3003723 something like a cage has to be built for them there is no choice there is a wild animal there that has to be locked up in one way or another
3003724 barbarians who want to take our lives at the moment that society is in the state of being a serial killer it is a very sick society it should be treated the way we treat individuals who are serial killers
3003725 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian program is geared to making weapons not to the peaceful application of nuclear power
3003726 everyone knows that such measures economic sanctions have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied
3003727 never advocated a genocidal attack on iran with the aim of killing 70 million iranians
3003728 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
3003729 israeli nuclear threat morris has pre determined the result israel will have to engage in a genocidal nuclear assault on iran
3003730 it was not as though there was a palestinian people in palestine and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them they did not exist
3003731 which sought to establish two nations in the land of israel
3003732 when we complete the permanent agreement we will hold 78 percent of the land while the palestinians will control 22 percent
3003733 documented indiscriminate beating tear gassing and shooting of children at home or just outside the house playing in the street who were sitting in the classroom or going to the store for groceries
3003734 our task is to recreate a barrier and once again put the fear of death into the arabs of the area
3003735 save the children concluded that one third of beaten children were under ten years old and one fifth under the age of five nearly a third of the children beaten suffered broken bones
3003736 we got orders to knock on every door enter and take out all the males the younger ones we lined up with their faces against the wall and soldiers beat them with billy clubs this was no private initiative these were orders from our company commander after one soldier finished beating a detainee another soldier called him you nazi and the first man shot back you bleeding heart when one soldier tried to stop another from beating an arab for no reason a fist fight broke out
3003737 israeli interrogators routinely ill treat and torture arab prisoners prisoners are hooded or blindfolded and are hung by their wrists for long periods most are struck in the genitals or in other ways sexually abused most are sexually assaulted others are administered electric shock
3003738 there is no country in the world in which the use of official and sustained torture is as well established and documented as in the case of israel
3003739 upon arrest a detainee undergoes a period of starvation deprivation of sleep by organized methods and prolonged periods during which the prisoner is made to stand with his hands cuffed and raised a filthy sack covering the head prisoners are dragged on the ground beaten with objects kicked stripped and placed under ice cold showers
3003740 thomas are reminds me of dietrich bonhoeffer an active pastor who comes to the unsettling realization that he and his people have been fed a terrible lie that is killing and torturing thousands of innocent men women and children not without ample research and prayer does such a pastor in turn risk unsettling his congregation the reverend are has done his homework and i suspect has prayed often and long during the writing of this courageous book
3003741 this book will make the reader squirm it asks you to lend your voice in behalf of the voiceless
3003742 we cannot allow others to dictate our thinking on any subject especially on anything as important as christian faithfulness which is tested by an attitude towards seeking justice for the oppressed its a christians duty to know
3003743 speak up for the palestinians and you will make enemies yet as christians we must be willing to raise issues that until now we have chosen to dodge
3003744 der zugang zu dieser region bleibt f r uns von vordringlicher bedeutung
3003745 well anyway i looked up and saw the very last thing i expected a huge lion coming slowly toward me and one queer thing was that there was no moon last night but there was moonlight where the lion was so it came nearer and nearer i was terribly afraid of it you may think that being a dragon i could have knocked any lion out easily enough but it wasnt that kind of fear i wasnt afraid of it eating me i was just afraid of if if you can understand well it came close up to me and looked straight into my eyes and i shut my eyes tight but that wasnt any good because it told me to follow it
3003746 i knew it was a well because you could see the water bubbling up from the bottom of it but it was a lot bigger than most wells like a very big round bath with marble steps going down into it
3003747 i was just going to say that i couldnt undress because i hadnt any clothes on when i suddenly thought that dragons are snaky sort of things and snakes can cast their skins
3003748 but just as i was going to put my feet into the water i looked down and saw that they were all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as they had been before
3003749 then the lion said but i dont know if it spoke
3003750 the very first tear he made was so deep that i thought it had gone right into my heart
3003751 well he peeled the beastly stuff right off just as i thought id done it myself the other three times only they hadnt hurt and there it was lying on the grass only ever so much thicker and darker and more knobbly looking than the others had been
3003752 after a bit the lion took me out and dressed
3003753 well i dont exactly remember that bit but he did somehow or other in new clothes the same ive got on now as a matter of fact and then suddenly i was back here which is what makes me think it must have been a dream
3003754 well there are the clothes for one thing and you have been well un dragoned for another

3003757 het is een teken van snelle integratie vakantie als statussymbool even een weekendje new york kleding kopen in milaan was bij autochtone jongeren een paar jaar geleden in zwang en nu bij allochtone jongeren de verhoudingen met de ouders is in veel gezinnen veranderd ze krijgen de vrijheid zelf hun vakantiebestemming te bepalen
3003758 maar niet om zes weken in het geboortedorp van hun ouders of grootouders te bivakkeren die jongeren flaneren op de boulevards van tanger istanbul en parimaribo het is zien en gezien worden en ze komen overal bekenden tegen op de boulevard van tanger loopt half amsterdam west en slotervaart
3003759 tanger is een mooie stad maar het is niet mijn soort stad marokko is een islamitisch land maar de meisjes liggen er in bikini en string op het strand iedereen moet dat zelf weten maar ik vind dat hypocriet
3003760 turkije is een prachtig land maar we wilden eens wat anders
3003761 ik was nieuwsgierig naar zuidoost azi maleisi is hoofdzakelijk islamitisch maar heeft weer heel eigen gebruiken maleisi rs zijn heel open en liberaal ik zag bijvoorbeeld meisjes met een hoofddoek alcohol schenken dat zie je zelfs in nederland bijna niet ik had vrouwen met een niqaab verwacht maar die zag ik niet ze droegen een hoofddoek zoals in turkije
3003762 bungalowparken zijn vaak heel wit allochtonen voelen zich er een uitzondering de parken zouden veel meer niet westerse allochtonen kunnen trekken als ze iets meer een multiculti sfeer zouden uitstralen

3003766 better sheds light on the truth of the real presence in the eucharist
3003767 priests at the london oratory have called for prayers of reparation
3003768 an evening of reparation with mass and adoration with prayers litanies and silent meditation
3003769 as a result of julys alleged theft and desecration of the eucharist priests at the london oratory are urging worshipers to be vigilant at mass and to receive communion on the tongue
3003770 we also have it should be remembered a growing population in london and the south east
3003771 we have we estimate about 380 000 more people coming in to the region and we have to make sure that our infrastructure our networks our treatment works are all ready to cope with that influx of people
3003772 this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing there will be an inevitable impact on bills but even so we will be able to keep them below the industry average

3003775 most companies cant value the benefit of micro format content
3003776 i like the use of alerts and tweetbeep for monitoring the conversation
3003777 i like the use of micro blogging to instantly join redirect or calm a conversation
3003778 the concept of conversation scares most large companies because its a lot less controlled than issuing a press release or a spokespersons well considered statement

3003785 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
3003786 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
3003787 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
3003788 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
3003789 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
3003790 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
3003791 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
3003792 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
3003793 although still in development blackwaters new airships can fly twice as long as air force predators and operate at one fifth the cost said blackwater worldwide ceo erik prince
3003794 oh but theyre cheaper than a predator and can fly longer
3003795 especially with the state budget the way it is an endowment that could help with maintenance would be incredible
3003796 when we raised our money to build the entire facility we didnt have enough for the green room prop room etc
3003797 even more real than the olympics or the world series

3003801 an elder is anyone who feels theyve lived long enough to absorb wisdom from the people situations and circumstances of their life an amazing elder is someone ready to share their gifts of wisdom with anyone who asks
3003802 society is handicapped by the prevalent ideas and beliefs about what aging looks and feels like ideas inherited from generations past weve been taught that growing old is grim that its natural to lose many of our aptitudes and abilities and sure isnt fun not so many decades ago we were also taught that man couldnt fly
3003803 once we understand how much thoughts and beliefs determine what takes place in our bodies we can begin to take control change our thought patterns replace limiting beliefs and create the joyful life we want

3003842 the current gold standard diagnostic evaluation for cup consists of a careful history and physical examination laboratory tests imaging studies invasive studies when necessary and thorough pathologic evaluation this process is lengthy and exposes the patient to unnecessary toxicities
3003843 rosetta genomics microrna based cup assay may present an alternative test to current diagnostic practices this study aims to validate their assay as well as compare its performance with current tests for cup
3003844 nexxnows business strategy employs the exchange of its proprietary media technology
3003845 the premier basketball league has two teams in the province of quebec the quebec kebekwa and the montreal sasquatch therefore this relationship was strategically planned as we go forward and employ the advertising secured to bring value to our multi media platform and league sponsors

3003848 however our consolidated results continue to be adversely affected by ongoing dispute with the bvi government over ownership of its baughers bay plant our decision to adjust results to the cash basis as a result of this dispute led to a downward variation in our second quarter net income of more than 1 2 million when compared with the prior year period exclusive of our equity in the operating results of our oc bvi affiliate the companys consolidated operations recorded a 29 increase in net income in the most recent quarter when compared with the second quarter of 2007
3003849 while retail revenues were relatively unchanged from a year earlier in the cayman islands gross profit margins improved in our retail business segment
3003850 bulk water sales rose 28 in the most recent quarter while we experienced a modest narrowing of gross profit margins in that business segment due primarily to increased diesel fuel costs at our windsor plant in the commonwealth of the bahamas services revenues almost tripled prior year levels due to higher relative project construction expenditures in the 2008 quarter while gross profits from the services segment increased over year earlier levels a decline in the segments gross profit margin reflected an increase in the estimated project costs for a plant currently under construction in bermuda
3003851 shortly after the end of the second quarter we were pleased to announce that we were the successful bidder for the privatization of the water utility on five of the eleven inhabited islands in the turks and caicos islands a british overseas territory located just below the commonwealth of the bahamas in the atlantic ocean on a longer term basis we remain highly confident that potable water will become an increasingly scarce resource worldwide and the company is pursuing prospective seawater desalination projects in a number of countries

3003870 during the past year weve seen acceleration in all sectors of the tem market especially as enterprises begin to see the value in improved processes and greater control over one of their largest indirect expense areas
3003871 the move toward more comprehensive tem solutions that include wireless and mobile management as well as eprocurement and usage management goes beyond simple cost reduction and now includes higher level business process outsourcing functions that challenge corporations to approach tem from the top down to transform the way they manage their telecom spend this is particularly critical for multi national companies and firms that have a global reach

3003897 you can connect things through web services but if your end points dont have a common understanding of whats flowing through the system and if you dont create a data interoperability layer then you wont have accurate communication much less a successful soa
3003898 soa teams that integrate services with an interlocking web of point to point data mappings are undermining the fundamental soa principles of loose coupling

3004092 not at all that was our impartial and probably unanimous judgment we saw attorneys hold back tears and weep alongside their clients we saw judges prosecutors clerks and marshals do their duty sometimes with a heavy heart but always with a particular solemnity not accorded to the common criminals theyre used to encountering
3004093 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3004094 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number
3004095 as a citizen i want our judges to administer justice not a federal agency when the executive branch forces the hand of the judiciary the result is abuse of power and arbitrariness unworthy of a democracy founded upon the constitutional principle of checks and balances

3004160 schools where poor children and children of color do better than their peers in others schools
3004161 what did you promise me you sat in that office and promised me and your mother something what was it
3004162 once the state tests are done in march and april we dont do a lot of instruction were doing field trips and getting ready for the end of the year
3004163 under strict accountability to not allow students to turn in half filled out answer sheets and they cant have any wild answers either
3004164 they teach students how to act by noticing and encouraging kindness and consideration and they teach kids how to have good social and professional relationships by explicitly teaching them how to disagree with someone without getting upset and fighting
3004165 the processes of thinking are intertwined with the content of thought that is domain knowledge
3004166 thus if you remind a student to look at an issue from multiple perspectives often enough he will learn that he ought to do so but if he doesnt know much about an issue he cant think about it from multiple perspectives
3004167 why dont students like school a cognitive scientist answers questions about how your mind works and what it means for the classroom
3004168 most states had initiatives designed to encourage educators to teach critical thinking and one of the most widely used programs tactics for thinking sold 70 000 teacher guides
3004169 the evidence shows that such programs primarily improve students thinking with the sort of problems they practiced in the program not with other types of problems
3004170 more generally its doubtful that a program that effectively teaches students to think critically in a variety of situations will ever be developed
3004171 the signers of this letter are school superintendents representing a cross section of districts including some of the finest public schools in the nation
3004172 although some of our schools may seem to be the fortunate beneficiaries of your articles we all believe that all schools communities and your readers are poorly served by newsweeks persistent efforts to use a single statistic the number of students who sit for ap or ib exams to rank schools
3004173 the inventor of this flawed methodology jay mathews has insisted that it is meaningful because ap or ib participation is the sole available nationwide measure of whether students take a rigorous program of study
3004174 in reality it is impossible to know which high schools are the best in the nation determining whether different schools do or dont offer a high quality of education requires a look at many different measures including students overall academic accomplishments and their subsequent performance in college and taking into consideration the unique needs of their communities students and school communities deserve better than simplistic and misleading school rankings and that is why the signers of this letter will not respond to your request for our ap or ib test data we respectfully insist that you omit our schools from your rankings no matter how well we score even if you already have our data or obtain it in some other way
3004175 smart caps would allow schools that have met a performance threshold to replicate as fast as they are able to the performance threshold could be for instance schools that perform in the top quartile of all schools or the top 10 percent or 15 percent of similar schools both charter opponents and supporters claim to be concerned about quality and this policy is keenly linked to school quality
3004176 though a school or school district might only lose 15 percent of its students
3004177 it cant cut its energy bill by 15 percent or have 15 percent less custodial or cafeteria staff
3004178 the career academies produced an increase in earnings of 132 per month during the first four years of the follow up period and 216 per month in the final four years
3004179 the career academies produced an average increase of 311 in real monthly earnings for young men this amounts to a 17 percent increase over and above the average earnings of 1 792 per month of young men in the non academy group
3004180 in all one third of the academy group were living independently with their children and a spouse or partner compared with 27 percent of the non academy group
3004181 specifically the academies increased marriage rates for young men by 9 percentage points from 27 percent for the non academy group to 36 percent for the academy group and increased custodial parenthood by nearly 12 percentage points from 25 percent for the non academy group to nearly 37 percent for the academy group
3004182 employment rates for african american men ages 20 to 24 have been declining steadily since 1970 from around 77 percent in 1969 to only 56 percent in 2003
3004183 even in the peak economic period of 1999 african american and hispanic males aged 16 to 24 were far more likely to be neither working nor enrolled in school than white males of the same age 22
3004184 the magnitude of the impacts on monthly earnings for young men exceed differences in earnings that have been found in other research comparing young workers who have two years of community college with those who have only a high school diploma
3004185 students enrolled in advanced placement classes at two schools in the northern valley regional high school district in bergen county are now required to take the ap exams this month or receive a failing grade in the courses under a new school policy being questioned by some parents and students
3004186 the law should have set uniform standards and measures for the nation then freed states districts and schools to produce those results as they think best perhaps even on timetables of their own devising lawmakers should also have insisted on school performance being judged primarily by how much a school causes its pupils achievement to rise not just how theyre faring in relation to fixed standards
3004187 republicans say they care about standards and choices but their own constituents are at best smug about todays schools and at worst hostile to reform that might help poor and minority kids to enter their suburban enclaves both parties have screwy ideas about how to balance freedom and regulation in the k 12 domain with republicans shunning uniform standards but tolerating government micro management while democrats seem to care more about where the money goes than whether kids are learning
3004188 have periodic emergencies agitated parents or aggrieved teachers or other crises that we get pulled into and were losing our financial shirt investing far more time energy and expertise including pricey outside consultants in this work than the schools sponsorship fees begin to cover
3004189 big mistake at the high school level sidwell seems to work well for motivated and self disciplined learners but its lack of structure was exactly wrong for our unstructured and directionless son he learned very little his grades were mediocre and if the school cared about any of this nobody let on

3004193 goes to for profit companies whose bottom line is sometimes less the well being of the children than the balance of their bank accounts the largest and most well known of the charter operators white hat management had only two of its 31 schools make the federal benchmark of adequate yearly progress in 2006 2007
3004194 funded by aol the gap and wal mart these groups operate outside of public scrutiny and the extent of their involvement in the evolution of public education remains relatively unexplored by the mainstream media
3004195 well freddie it appears that the party of the first part has been accused of violation of the federal antitrust act by the party of the second part isnt that exciting yes it is and the party of the second part

3004206 what makes the service special is that the counsellors are all disabled people themselves providing them with an understanding of what it means to live as a disabled person in scotland
3004207 counselling can help people who are trying to come to terms with painful events from their past or who need support through a current crisis or change in lifestyle it can also help people who are struggling to manage difficult feelings such as depression or anxiety or who are seeking direction and meaning in their lives a counsellor will not judge you nor tell you how to live your life instead he or she is trained to help you explore your own situation and to support you to find your own way forward

3004222 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all even when he was captured and the evidence all showed that there was an ak 47 right there in the front seat the guys behind him and in front of him deployed weapons he bailed out of the car and ran
3004223 when he knows that hes in u s hands when he is relatively secure that no one is going to bring harm to him or his family you can understand that the level of cooperation changed and thats very understandable again from our point of view as armed forces members
3004224 it was a framework which we were told to operate in its different from a regular ucmj uniform code of military justice court martial type proceeding we understood that from the get go we understood the judges instructions
3004225 do you really think they are going to take him back with open arms even if he felt any inclination to go back which we dont think he did
3004226 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder a thought really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what its ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im just just gonna go out there and put it and honestly in like 5 seconds i was thinking all these things and just got like a supercharge and just took it from there and you know it was was unreal
3004227 we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
3004228 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
3004229 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
3004230 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and lot of it goes back to previous education
3004231 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
3004232 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
3004233 by week six theyre starting its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
3004234 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
3004235 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go

3004241 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
3004242 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
3004243 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
3004244 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
3004245 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
3004246 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
3004247 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
3004248 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight
3004249 you need to feed them you need to re supply them you need to give them equipment you need to give them mobility cars trucks helicopters
3004250 we had an awesome race and we were pushed by the french and the australians i think we all just came together and thats how we were able to go so fast
3004251 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder a thought really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way
3004252 and then i changed i said you know what thats ridiculous its the olympics and im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im just gonna go out there honestly in like 5 seconds i was thinking all these things and just got like a supercharge and just took it from there it was unreal
3004253 i just knew that last 15 20 meters was going to be out of control i just remember sitting there just pounding on the blocks saying the f word just like come on i just remember looking at the finish and it was a perfect touch and i looked up at the block and then i was just ecstatic
3004254 the french team was talking a little trash and you know it fired me up more than anything else
3004255 i think michael knows we did not do this for him he was just a part of it and we were a part of it
3004256 if you step into this arena youll see a thing of beauty its really a thing of absolute beauty
3004257 its a perfect depth because if its too deep you lose your sense of vision and where youre at in the pool but its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom
3004258 its physics and its not sports but it makes sense
3004259 you make a deeper and a wider pool and you give all of those waves and all of that splashing and all of that moving water a chance to move away from the swimmers and get out of their way which makes them go faster its as simple as that
3004260 everything is just fantastic about this pool ive never seen such a big facility in my life and you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are held
3004261 technology has really kind of tapped out as far as the building of these kinds of facilities
3004262 its not like track and field where the types of tracks just get faster and faster because i guess there is more spring to them
3004263 but i dont know how you make fast water its just not possible
3004264 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
3004265 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
3004266 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3004267 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
3004268 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3004269 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3004270 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3004271 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3004272 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3004273 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3004274 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3004275 start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the american way and all that shit
3004276 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3004277 i didnt check out 08 but i have played the

3004279 did you ever play the series or get into it
3004280 ca0055 could not load file intermediateassembly gt obj debug before postsharp extendhealth utilities dll
3004281 it ought to strike fear in the heart of every market favoring person that youve got major things undermining the public trust in our capital markets
3004282 please please please you have no idea how many kinds of hell my life
3004283 garbage that nearly ruined my marriage and made me want to kill myself really
3004284 today we put the fire out and immediately after that we started trying to cool down the pipeline as soon as the cooling process ends we will begin assessing the damage and start repairs
3004285 you can slice it and dice it you can try to word it any way you want to it cost us the game
3004286 but you know what i miss them i miss their optimism and cheerfulness at a time when people are droning on and on about chinas human rights and tibet whilst seemingly looking the other way at the progress they have made and the fact that other western governments do
3004287 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
3004288 this brings activity since the start of the year closer in line with our 2008 forecast of more than 200 000 housing starts for the seventh consecutive year
3004289 the balkans a history of bulgaria serbia greece romania turkey
3004290 the casual gamers tastes today are pretty basic but they wont be in five or ten years time
3004291 its a symbol of the fact that families are supporting marty ozinga
3004292 im shocked that democrats think this is important to the voters of the 11th district
3004293 it shows just how bankrupt they are of ideas and that they would go to any lengths not to talk about debbie halvorsons record
3004294 bill foster has used his brief stint in office to define himself as an out of touch obstructionist but this report card paints an alarming picture of a member of congress who will do anything he can to side with democrat leadership instead of the people of illinois
3004295 i dont see any reason why bindra shouldnt make at least a couple of crores now
3004296 he is young good looking and has a photogenic face all of these factors count for signing up decent contracts
3004297 we backed him at athens we have backed him now its a dream come true for him and us
3004298 i had expected endorsements to come his way after he won the world championship gold medal in 2006 in zagreb croatia but that didnt happen
3004299 i stumbled on twitter when a professor in my masters program mentioned it
3004300 the folks at nasa have done an amazing job anthropomorphizing the mars phoenix lander to disseminate breaking martian discoveries and the account has enjoyed meteoric success
3004301 most companies cant value the benefit of micro format content
3004302 i like the use of alerts and tweetbeep for monitoring the conversation
3004303 i like the use of micro blogging to instantly join redirect or calm a conversation
3004304 the concept of conversation scares most large companies because its a lot less controlled than issuing a press release or a spokespersons well considered statement

3004309 do you have money to pay the auto rickshaw driver or not
3004310 you take down my name and do what you want
3004311 he has been going in and out of hospital and has missed out on a lot of things over the last year
3004312 we contacted ray of sunshine and said he wanted to train with manchester united
3004313 but the team were in south africa so they said would he like to be a mascot we thought it would be at old trafford so when we were told it would be at wembley he was absolutely over the moon he did not sleep for two days before he was so excited
3004314 he is very selfless it just seems to be one thing after another for him but he doesnt let it get him down and just gets on with things
3004315 sometimes he gets upset and that makes everyone else upset but after a couple of days he picks himself up and we try and do something special for him
3004316 he seems to have taken everything in his stride which is so impressive especially when you think about what he has had to go through at such an early age
3004317 he is a very courageous boy who has been through a lot and it is a pleasure to be able to help him
3004318 financial reports and people are becoming more and more used to them just as people have an answer to microsoft windows for their desktops or google for their search
3004319 its a fantastic game for me and for our supporters as carlisle are a very good side
3004320 i was delighted when the draw came out its been some time since i left so i hope any ill feeling has passed and we can watch a great game

3004343 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3004344 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3004345 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3004346 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3004347 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3004348 on july 11 i was coming out of cvs and had just gotten into my car when i noticed a baby bird a sparrow on the ground next to the building i watched for a while and it did not appear able to move even when a sibling came up to it and then quickly flew away
3004349 i got out of my car checked the bird over and could tell it was injured and in shock so i picked it up and brought it home long story short nothing appeared to be broken just very badly bruised with a few cuts and he had all his pinfeathers so i decided to try to nurse him back to health
3004350 my daughter found me a web site for care and feeding and i did what i could
3004351 on the third day he started eating really well and drinking water boy was he cute on the fourth day he was able to use his left leg and foot and would get up on the perch in the cage and chirp until i came to bottle feed him what a nut
3004352 i was housebound because he ate about every two hours during the day at night he would just go to sleep in the sock nest and i wouldnt hear a peep out of him
3004353 on july 18 id had him for seven days and he was getting very strong
3004354 after a short wait his parents came to meet him he was so excited to see them he puffed himself up shook all over and then as quickly as he came into my life he flew off with his mom
3004355 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3004356 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3004357 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3004358 the united states supreme court has made it abundantly clear that election officials are only permitted to regulate public statements that explicitly address elections they are not permitted to regulate public statements that relate to officeholders conduct even though those officeholders may be running for re election this is fundamental to the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech the attorney generals statement that he recognizes what can be regulated on the basis of whether it walks like a duck is an indication that he doesnt understand the law in this area and he is inviting entirely unnecessary litigation against the state of new mexico

3004361 the quadrennial review is being done by contractors thats ironic
3004362 i dont know how you would set up a metric
3004363 the number and proportion of contractors is the wrong metric
3004364 many times the number of contractors is less relevant the issue is what is the mission and what are the total resources available
3004365 till you do right by me everything you think about is gonna crumble
3004366 from a contracting perspective there will be no change and no loss of contracts or change in mission
3004367 there is a discussion about what are inherently governmental functions
3004368 if they are defined too broadly it will cut out contracts
3004369 the term inherently governmental is very confusing and hard to pin down
3004370 evan if you dont stop that im going to take away all your toys

3004399 this is a good move for the company it shall force all the shorts to cover and the brokers not willing to support the company to get out of our way for a while giving us a chance to complete the restructuring of the company this should give us increased shareholder value as i stated before this will simultaneously reward our loyal shareholders and thwart any potential naked short selling activities or market abuses and force the shorts to cover i would like to reassure shareholders that while growing the companys bottom line is our day to day business we are examining any potentially negative market activities impeding our long term value and exploring direct means of recourse

3004401 an important motivating factor to migrate to inews 2 7 is seeing how the inews community feature creates new ways for our reporters to work together our journalists are becoming media agnostic so whether the story is for the radio television or web we need to turn content around quickly and reliably
3004402 the new content sharing capabilities will enable us to take full advantage of all broadcast stories within our four systems and eventually enable us to change the way we handle things by integrating all of the tools used by journalists the beta tests concluded that the implementation of inews 2 7 could present an excellent opportunity for our editorial teams to redefine how they segment the newsroom and improve the overall functionality of their daily tasks

3004415 over the past twelve months we have significantly enriched the pharmaceutical utility of our core phosphorodiamidate morpholino pmo technology through the addition of several new derivative chemistries that could improve the bioavailability potency and therapeutic index of the original chemical series overall our antisense based chemistries significantly expand the field of rna based therapeutics by not only competitively inhibiting mrna translation but by also directing the processing of pre mrna to provide potential therapeutic benefit in an important range of diseases we believe these unique capabilities which are not encompassed by the technology portfolio and intellectual property estate of our competitors position avi to secure a leading role in the future successes of rna based drug development
3004416 we have just begun to feel the impact of our newly acquired intellectual property the recent advances in our core chemistry the new product focus brought to our pipeline the additions to our leadership team and the fiscal measures employed to extend our current financial runway we believe that there are partnership opportunities for a company that can go beyond simple inhibition of mrna we believe we are such a company but we now have to demonstrate this to capture the full value from our technology and intellectual property with the ongoing and increasing interest in rna based therapeutics by both the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors we believe our renewed activity and focus on business development coupled with our preclinical and clinical advances are happening at an opportune time

3004420 cloudav also caches analysis results speeding up the process compared with traditional antivirus software this could be useful for workplaces for example where multiple employees might access the same document the new approach also includes what the developers call retrospective detection which scans its file access history when a new threat is identified this allows it to catch previously missed infections earlier

3004422 just downing a few cold ones doesnt make a person irresponsible
3004423 im feeling pretty good now and im anxious to get back on track
3004424 brno is a track i like a lot and i believe its the motogp track ive ridden most frequently in my career which means i know the place like the back of my hand
3004425 the engine stalled but i managed to get it restarted but lost a lot of places after that we could see that i had no chance to win so we pitted for slick tyres along with several other drivers but the track took a while to dry
3004426 my times were coming down every lap though and its good to have got the fastest lap but i think otherwise i could have easily had a top five finish
3004427 im very happy with the outcome considering the starts they both had
3004428 we made the decision to call them both in to switch tyres and they did a superb job after that

3004476 it was amazing the gate was actually moving and chris held that position like it was nothing

3004523 good governance and effective relationship management is what distinguishes outsourcing deals that deliver value from those that disappoint

3004546 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends in coles and woolies you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
3004547 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar with such conservative palates australians are not going to rapidly embrace challenging new native flavours
3004548 native foods tick all the boxes of these emerging consumer trends
3004549 csiro is discovering that some native foods have high levels of antioxidants building on the 1980s research that found kakadu plums have the highest fruit source of vitamin c in the world
3004550 native foods are also tapping into an emerging groundswell of more adventurous eating in australia and in the future saltbush lamb lemon myrtle pasta and wattle seed ice cream might become as aussie as meat pies lamingtons and vegemite
3004551 i loved every bit of the gastronomy course but it was the issues and challenges facing the food industry which most intrigued me career wise hence my move from austrade to heinz after completing my thesis
3004552 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3004553 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3004554 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3004555 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general
3004556 ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients

3004566 he came to the club for a couple of days but it wasnt enough in helping me make a decision and to consider how much we were going to pay for him
3004567 but he showed in those two days that hes a very good player we sent from back page someone to norway to have a look at him and then well make a decision after that
3004568 i dont think any manager would sign a player on just two days trial unless they were lionel messi or someone like that
3004569 we need to look at players we are not just going to waste money
3004570 we have come in to the club late and are playing catch up at the moment
3004571 we are looking at numerous targets but we are not just going to spend money willy nilly its got to be on the right people

3004575 playing against italy was a tough draw but we shot well together
3004576 at one point we had a four point lead and kept shooting strong which made italy have to really step up their game
3004577 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3004578 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3004579 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3004580 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3004581 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3004582 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3004583 the next thing we know australias in our lane which in 10 years of rowing ive never seen anything like that its just bizarre all of a sudden you saw them coming over and they just about hit the back of our boat this has been a very eventful row so far
3004584 it was kind of this feeling of were getting ready for the fight and then its not there
3004585 so its pretty hard to calm down afterwards and last night was pretty restless
3004586 it just shows that they had to dig in to maintain their lead and we were in a very comfortable position
3004587 i know were in a strong position going into the final

3004594 with her alleged murderer has been rejected by dr kenneth shorrock who examined the body
3004595 there was nothing which suggests this was a sex act
3004596 this is just an ordinary rather cluttered room with a body
3004597 if i exclude from my mind that this person was a transsexual the issue does not appear
3004598 to put it simply there was no evidence of kinky sex if you take that out of the equation you just have a strangled body

3004611 it could have a significant chilling effect on the reporting of the private lives of celebrities
3004612 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
3004613 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
3004614 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
3004615 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
3004616 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
3004617 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest
3004618 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
3004619 it allows the rich powerful and celebrities to manipulate their images in the way they want them manipulated rather than having some transparency
3004620 they said privacy laws would be ok on the whole if anyone with a pr agent was exempt from taking an action
3004621 i think it may be a sensible development for the media as it would mean the defamation laws dont get stretched to be used as a substitute for proper protection against invasion of privacy
3004622 yep i like the idea of a right to privacy and yep i like the idea of a right to freedom of expression
3004623 it is a carefully done study that strongly confirms the relationship between salt and hypertension high blood pressure
3004624 the power of this study is that it includes a very large cohort
3004625 the study clearly showed that people who had elevated salt intake were the ones who had high blood pressure that was independent of the genotype for this specific gene

3004631 quite clearly there is nothing in the quantum point the judge perfectly well explains why he chose 60 000 rather than 75 000 there is nothing in the security point since mr milton did not apply for security below therefore as a matter of principle it is not for us to impose it
3004632 i am not persuaded that such a long delay can be said to fall within even the generous ambit of the discretion the variation to be made to introduce fairness could be achieved in one of two ways either we can shorten the period for payment or alternatively we could leave the exceptional length but impose an interest provision the simplest solution and in my judgment the better solution is to abbreviate the period within which this debt should be discharged and i would take simply the anniversary of the judgment below namely 6 december 2008
3004633 seems to me to be a perfectly achievable target mrs milton needed to obtain a mortgage to raise the lump sum and one that should be achieved in the interests of overall fairness

3004639 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3004640 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3004641 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3004642 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3004643 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

3004810 in the month since apple opened an online software clearinghouse called the app store users have downloaded more than 60 million programs for the iphone and ipod touch chief executive steve jobs said in an interview at apples headquarters while most of those applications were free apple sold an average of 1 million a day in applications for a total of about 30 million in sales over the month mr jobs said
3004811 if sales stay at the current pace apple stands to reap at least 360 million a year in new revenue from the app store mr jobs said this things going to crest a half a billion soon he added who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time ive never seen anything like this in my career for software he said
3004812 mr jobs is betting applications will sell more iphones and wireless enabled ipod touch devices enhancing the appeal of the products in the same way music sold through apples itunes has made ipods more desirable

3004814 richard doherty an analyst with market research firm envisioneering group says apple has caught competitors off guard theyve lost developers to apple he says
3004815 mr jobs said developers share of iphone application sales in the first month was about 21 million of which the top 10 developers earned roughly 9 million
3004816 once again apple has seen the future built a bridge to it and is taking consumers along for the journey
3004817 you just dont see this kind of grassroots market place support and development excitement around the sectors biggest players like nokia microsof and research in motion and im not saying apple will eclipse them any time soon but when and if that does happen apples app store is the kind of thing that can sure speed it up
3004818 microsofts zune is looking to hollywood to gain an edge on apples ipod
3004819 microsoft executives have been making the rounds at talent agencies and production companies in recent months in hopes of licensing exclusive original video programming for the portable media player which has struggled to gain traction in the marketplace
3004820 while microsoft has denied persistent rumors that zune would expand into communications a la apples iphone the company confirmed being in an exploratory phase regarding supplementing the tv content it already licenses from studios with zune only fare
3004821 but rather than just stock up on traditional formats like sitcoms zune is looking for nonconventional programming that can capitalize on the devices social networking platform according to richard winn director of entertainment development at zune what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldnt winn said
3004822 exclusivity could mean either locking up content that only appears on the zune platform or syndicating content that appears first on zune before moving elsewhere with zune branding
3004823 finding some point of distinction is becoming paramount for zune as it strives to come anywhere close to the market share that ipod has amassed among portable media players in may microsoft said that just 2 million zunes had been sold since the products launch in november 2006 an average of 90 000 total units per month whereas apple reportedly averages 3 5 million ipod sales per month which is about 40 times that of zune

3004831 lots of different types of flavoured oil are available in the shops containing garlic peppercorns chilli and various herbs including rosemary oregano and bay leaves and these often have a long shelf life but its not a good idea to make flavoured oils at home unless you are going to use them immediately this is because plants including herbs and spices can carry spores produced by bacteria occasionally they could carry spores of a type of bacteria called clostridium botulinum which can cause botulism this is a very unpleasant disease which is rare in the uk but can be fatal clostridium botulinum multiplies in places without any oxygen so if there are spores on plants such as herbs and garlic putting them in oil can create the right conditions for the bacteria to multiply particularly if the herbs are fresh or wet companies that produce flavoured oils and foods preserved in oil are expected to take clostridium botulinum into account and formulate their products to make sure that this type of bacteria doesnt multiply even though recipes for flavoured oils can be found in cookery books magazines and websites these might not have considered the risk of botulism so if you would like to make your own flavoured oil the safest option is to make a small quantity and use it on the day you have made it if you have some oil left over put it in the fridge straight away and use it within a week some oils can go cloudy or become solid in the fridge but if this happens dont be tempted to leave it at room temperature because this might not be safe

3004841 democratic pollster celinda lake last week found 76 percent of clinton primary voters saying they will vote for obama 18 percent for mccain but 18 percent of 18 million is a sizable and potentially vocal voting bloc one capable of casting a shadow over the unity efforts of grass roots activists who have spent the two months since obama clinched the nomination trying to build bridges after a long often bitter primary battle

3004845 suggested getting much rougher with obama in a memo on march 30 after her crucial wins in texas and ohio does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him
3004846 he had an extramarital affair with a filmmaker working for his campaign and repeatedly lied about it but he denied that he fathered her 5 month old baby
3004847 win votes among union members and low income workers he might have been a contender for a cabinet position such as attorney general
3004848 any potential voter or cabinet vetter would have to consider loose ends
3004849 john edwards nasty mistress cattily dissed his cancer stricken wife to a friend and later coldly blamed the ailing spouse for getting her fired from a videography job on her lovers presidential campaign a new report claims
3004850 compared john edwards with gandhi and went around trashing his cancer stricken wife it was reported sunday
3004851 whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none
3004852 some national news organizations tried halfheartedly to confirm the tawdry tale they ignored it in public wary of the national enquirer of edwardss dismissal of tabloid trash of wading once again into the swamp of sexual scandal without definitive proof
3004853 early last week journalists were in the awkward position of refusing to report on explosive allegations that were almost certain to knock the former north carolina senator out of the democratic convention they were in a box of their own making one that came to feel airtight and uncomfortable
3004854 one question that is emerging is whether the coverage of edwardss moral lapse will encourage the news media to investigate the private lives of other public figures including presidential candidates john mccain and barack obama
3004855 repeatedly declined to rule out the possibility that the republican nominee may pledge to serve just one term
3004856 demurred three times when chris wallace raised the prospect that mccain may use the republican convention next month to make such a promise wallace raised the prospect much discussed in political circles that mccain could combine the one term pledge with a vow that he would run an apolitical administration
3004857 he can be pragmatic but on the biggest decisions he tends to favour his instinct for the bigger picture
3004858 if there is such a thing as campaigning to become somebodys vice president mr pawlenty is doing a good job in the auditions
3004859 said on sunday that it was pulling its troops out of the separatist province of south ossetia but its appeals for a ceasefire in the widening conflict in the caucasus failed to halt russias mounting military response
3004860 aims in the conflict had gone beyond securing the pro russian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia to weakening the armed forces of georgia
3004861 said that it was unclear whether russia intended a full invasion of georgia but that its aims could go as far as destroying its armed forces or overthrowing georgias pro western president mikheil saakashvili
3004862 the violence appeared to show gargantuan russias determination to subdue diminutive us backed georgia even at the risk of international reproach
3004863 russian tanks and soldiers poured into the devastated south ossetian capitol of tskhinvali after crushing a three day georgian attack to take control of its breakaway province the ferocity of the fighting could be seen on the streets
3004864 ignored calls for a truce and continued to bomb targets deep in georgia with little apparent opposition drawing new condemnation from the united states and other western countries
3004865 from the caucasus mountains to the middle east and south asia us diplomats and strategists say historical us adversaries such as moscow and tehran appear to be exploiting washingtons impending political transition and the white houses fixation on iraq to pursue international actions that might otherwise spark a more robust response from washington and its allies
3004866 as the fighting spreads to abkhazia on georgias black sea coast some western diplomats are worrying aloud over the regional implications of a new order in which russia reserves the right to use force to impose its will on neighboring states
3004867 gave another impassioned plea to the international community to come to his countrys aid
3004868 so far the us has shown no sign that it will offer georgia military assistance
3004869 is carrying 2 000 georgian troops back home from their stations in iraq
3004870 stop intervention and invasion of my sovereign country i think the u s has lots of leverage and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through and basically i think this is not about georgia anymore this is about basic values of humanity of american values that we always ourselves believed in
3004871 this war is not of georgias making nor is it georgias choice the kremlin designed this war earlier this year russia tried to provoke georgia by effectively annexing another of our separatist territories abkhazia when we responded with restraint moscow brought the fight to south ossetia ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3004872 told the united states on sunday that georgias democratically elected president must step down in order to settle the military conflict between the two countries
3004873 raises serious questions about russias objectives this is completely unacceptable and crosses a line
3004874 said his comments were misinterpreted and that he wasnt demanding mr saakashvilis removal
3004875 a man who issued orders to commit war crimes which resulted in thousands of deaths of peaceful civilians cannot be viewed by russia as a partner
3004876 is the first chance for the presidential candidates to demonstrate their response to an international crisis
3004877 mccains top foreign policy adviser randy scheunemann is a leading expert on us allied georgia and was a paid lobbyist for the former soviet republic until march in the run up to what has become a major battle between georgia and russia
3004878 was quick to try to paint mr scheunemanns dual roles as a conflict of interest after
3004879 swiftly took georgias side in the dispute and cited it as evidence that sen mccain is ensconced in a lobbyist culture as obama spokesman hari sevugan told reporters over the weekend
3004880 calls this the drill nothing congress as he pushes for expanding oil exploration do nothing in this case is also the subtext of the drill nothing charge now that house republicans have commandeered the house chamber since its recess began last week to urge speaker nancy pelosi to put a halt to the five week break
3004881 say they will continue to interrupt their summer break this week to hold daily protests at the capitol in their ongoing push to expand domestic oil drilling insisting the american people are with us
3004882 say their message is spreading and that their populist styled talk a thons are resonating with voters at home
3004883 insisted sunday that any security deal with the united states must contain a very clear timeline for the departure of us troops
3004884 that the departure schedule could be modified if the security situation changed
3004885 made clear that the iraqis would not accept a deal that lacks a timeline for the end of the us military presence
3004886 said the pact is about to be finished and probably would be presented to iraqs parliament when lawmakers return from their summer break next month
3004887 moqtada al sadr has taken yet another step in an attempt to transform his mahdi army militia from a force intent on battling us soldiers into a much broader social and political network that can still hold sway in the shifting landscape of iraq
3004888 sadrs chief spokesman says that the new direction is part of a gradual shift
3004889 pakistans intelligence agency is helping the taliban to pursue an insurgency in afghanistan that has seen a 50 percent hike in attacks in some areas this year
3004890 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
3004891 taliban fighters forced pakistani soldiers to retreat from a militants stronghold near the border with afghanistan over the weekend after a three day battle sent civilians fleeing from government airstrikes the pullback from bajaur an area of pakistans tribal region where the taliban and al qaeda have forged particularly close ties came after the military began an offensive there late last week
3004892 will not resign despite mounting calls that he step aside to spare pakistan the trauma of a bitter impeachment process
3004893 spoke on the same day senior officials in pakistans ruling coalition met to prepare a list of impeachment charges to be brought against musharraf including accusations that he violated the countrys constitution
3004894 a key party in pakistans ruling alliance claimed on sunday to have the support of more than 300 of the 440 members of the two houses of parliament in its efforts to impeach
3004895 the pakistan peoples party the leading coalition partner is in secret negotiations with mr musharrafs aides to offer the former general immunity from prosecution if he agrees to step down
3004896 well democrats are furious they are going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton
3004897 for china the olympics are an opportunity to try to change the worlds perception of them and they put on quite an opening ceremony they say it cost 300 million to produce and it might have even been more expensive if they didnt have slaves

3004903 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honoured to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3004904 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy

3004915 weve decided against releasing a 2009 version of money plus boxed product
3004916 microsoft money plus distribution efforts will focus on selling software online via download and we have discontinued traditional box sales of the software at retail i doubt this surprises many of you especially those whove discussed with me how annual releases dont make much sense for a product thats in its 17th version
3004917 broadband clearly is mainstream more and more people are shopping for software online particularly in the financial arena
3004918 this distribution model means less packaging which obviously is better for the environment clearly it makes sense for the marketplace todays consumers want instant gratification and last years sales percentages show that the immediacy of the download appeals to a large number of customers
3004919 online distribution means retailers can provide more inventory of our products but require less physical space to manage inventory

3004963 moving tanks and troops through the separatist enclave of south ossetia and advancing toward the city of gori in central georgia had gone beyond securing the pro russian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia to weakening the armed forces of georgia

3005005 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
3005006 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
3005007 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
3005008 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
3005009 i think it was wrong for senator obama to try to focus on a mccain adviser rather than actually listening to what mccain had to say about the policy rather than recognizing mccains years and years of experience when it comes to international affairs
3005010 i believe what senator mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong
3005011 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government

3005016 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3005017 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3005018 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight

3005023 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

3005118 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
3005119 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
3005120 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3005121 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
3005122 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v
3005123 if an abortion is performed or a natural birth occurred at any age even three months and the product of that was living outside the mother and somebody came and shot him i dont think theres any doubt that person would be prosecuted for murder

3005129 we are seeing die hard democrats tell us that obama is not their man
3005130 what happens when black republicans wake up the next day after the election and realize that you voted for a man to be president that you are totally philosophically opposed to
3005131 as an african american i am very proud of the accomplishments barack obamas been able to achieve
3005132 he said this election is not about race that i seemed like an affable fellow but my resume was a little thin to be a united states senator here we are a year later and this individual is running for president with less of a resume than i have i think barack himself makes the point

3005210 i have a friend i like like that and i don
3005211 i was buzzing with that it doesnt much better than this on a personal note
3005212 the team did well in the conditions but if we want to do anything this season weve got to be looking for three points and well be looking to improve
3005213 i think we should have won but at least we came away with a draw from what were terrible conditions
3005214 i just wanted to go on from the bench and do what i do it was great to get the equaliser to come on and make an impact like that on my debut is really pleasing
3005215 i dont remember too much about the move to be fair it just came to me and i tucked it away the main thing for us though is weve got to improve on that
3005216 weve got to win these sort of games if were going to push for anything
3005217 coming away with the point isnt the worst but weve got to be looking at three
3005218 we showed a lot going forward and showed the different options weve got as well
3005219 i think there are a good variety of strikers here now four different players sylv and keogh are different class and have a partnership that worked last year
3005220 i just want to come in and do my best and make sure i take my chance when i get it
3005221 i think the gaffer wanted to set out with four strikers to work with and different types which can only be good for the club in giving him options
3005222 he was brilliant for us last season and he will be this as well i just thought id change things and freshen things up with a bit more aerial physical presence
3005223 i could have left it because he was going to get booed by the fans or because hes our number one scorer or can i change things
3005224 its not always easy to come back to your old club where they used to love you and theyre calling you judas and you greedy so and so
3005225 all sylvan did wanted to do was progress his career and i think by moving from plymouth to wolves hes done that if that upsets all the plymouth fans then so be it
3005226 hes just looking for progression as everyone else is in their own jobs and careers and we all do it so all that doesnt wash with me
3005227 you move on you want to do better you want to improve

3005235 it makes more sense to write one big book a novel or nonfiction narrative than to write many stories or essays into a long ambitious project you can fit or pour all you possess and learn a project that takes five years will accumulate those years inventions and richnesses

3005262 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3005263 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3005264 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3005265 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3005266 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3005267 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3005268 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3005269 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3005270 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3005271 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3005272 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3005273 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3005274 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3005275 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3005276 there are many myths about international marriages but no one knows what percentage of the marriages actually end in divorce and how many unions survive and thrive this survey should put our minds at peace

3005287 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3005288 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
3005289 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
3005290 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
3005291 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
3005292 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
3005293 i went back on speaking engagements and encouraged african americans to go to africa to interact socially culturally and or economically
3005294 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3005295 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
3005296 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
3005297 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3005298 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
3005299 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
3005300 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
3005301 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
3005302 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
3005303 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
3005304 leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
3005305 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment

3005353 it is up to each agency to decide how to report their statistics
3005354 iraqs insistence that its laws should prevail stems largely from the excesses of private u s security contractors
3005355 s johnsen is an idiot you always assume that americans are evil killers you related to john murtha all the iraqis have to do is scare off the contractors then have us leave too early and iraq will be a hell hole all over again and america wont be back to save them

3005360 because i took some chances wrote with some new people and actually co wrote most of the songs on the album its very different

3005362 and he was much more into the vibe than perfection which is good for me because my tendency is to try to make things perfect
3005363 it comes from having to really look within yourself when youre forced to be alone and to not be afraid of that process
3005364 taking some time off from the road this year to write allowed me to do some growing and reflecting that i often put aside when im touring all the time
3005365 in kindergarten we had a pilot program at my public elementary school to teach five year olds suzuki violin lessons
3005366 they would give the lessons during naptime and i must have gotten out to go to the bathroom and i remember walking down the hallway and hearing these violins scratching out twinkle twinkle little star i was immediately drawn to that and came home and told mom i wanted to take violin lessons
3005367 but i was mesmerized by lovett fiddler andrea zonn i wanted to do what she was doing
3005368 casey driessen is now one of the greatest american fiddle players on the scene plays with bela fleck tim obrien and he was my roommate
3005369 he taught me one of the first fiddle tunes i ever learned
3005370 her voice has a character few achieve rather than a support player taking a minor turn she uses her first solo album to mark her ground as a singular talent
3005371 i feel the most comfortable when i have someone to react to
3005372 the process was completely different with each person i wrote with for example with mary gauthier we sat down one rainy afternoon in new york city and wrote the entire song more or less with dan wilson we just came up with a little melody and a few snippets of words while we were in the same room later i wrote the verses he came up with a great chorus and we put the song together via e mail and a few phone calls
3005373 i have to say i am very impressed shes got something unique in her voice thats very subtle and a little smoky and sweet i detect a certain wisdom in her and yet a sense of wonder as well
3005374 lucinda had sent me this beautiful email saying how much she loved my record and how she really saw something special there and if i ever wanted to open up for her thatd be great it was like wow merry christmas
3005375 i was pretty hung over that morning in my pajamas looking like a train wreck

3005379 on my album i address all of my previous issues and beefs this album will definitely project my growth as a music producer and artist
3005380 i named my album nasti muzik because i talk dirty while keeping it real at the same time a lot of people have the same thoughts about lifes situations but they dont have the guts to speak the truth
3005381 we f ck in the car we f ck in the house ill fix you breakfast butt naked while you eatin me out
3005382 drop low to your knees boy whistle on it then put that wood on it come in like you paid for it

3005384 this album will really show my musical maturity i had fun with this album it is artistically fun and creative
3005385 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

3005412 why senator obama would engage in a transaction with a man like rezco and why obama would count as a friend a long time ally who made his living filling his bank account with government money
3005413 but a partisan who uses high stake issues to prove his bona fides to his partys extreme elements
3005414 i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not

3005435 the justus boyz all american masculine image is a natural fit for our athletic coverage we became aware of justus boyz because of their unique print advertising campaign which features athletic guys looking hot in their underwear there was one ad in particular which caught our attention showing an incredibly fit guy holding himself straight out and parallel to the ground on a swinging gate to a corral our first thought was the photograph must have been created digitally because it didnt seem possible but it turns out model chris whitlow was goofing around while the crew was preparing for another shot and stunned everyone at the photo shoot with his athletic abilities
3005436 it was amazing the gate was actually moving and chris held that position like it was nothing

3005453 over the past twelve months we have significantly enriched the pharmaceutical utility of our core phosphorodiamidate morpholino pmo technology through the addition of several new derivative chemistries that could improve the bioavailability potency and therapeutic index of the original chemical series overall our antisense based chemistries significantly expand the field of rna based therapeutics by not only competitively inhibiting mrna translation but by also directing the processing of pre mrna to provide potential therapeutic benefit in an important range of diseases we believe these unique capabilities which are not encompassed by the technology portfolio and intellectual property estate of our competitors position avi to secure a leading role in the future successes of rna based drug development
3005454 we have just begun to feel the impact of our newly acquired intellectual property the recent advances in our core chemistry the new product focus brought to our pipeline the additions to our leadership team and the fiscal measures employed to extend our current financial runway we believe that there are partnership opportunities for a company that can go beyond simple inhibition of mrna we believe we are such a company but we now have to demonstrate this to capture the full value from our technology and intellectual property with the ongoing and increasing interest in rna based therapeutics by both the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors we believe our renewed activity and focus on business development coupled with our preclinical and clinical advances are happening at an opportune time

3005481 performing plantings is a never ending process unless the causes of plant losses are understood and addressed
3005482 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3005483 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land
3005484 the forest and wetland communities of inwood hill park are more diverse and have a greater structural variation than revealed by previous research
3005485 considering the results of this research on the long term ecology of the inwood park forest the natural resources group could avoid the problem observed by spanish born american poet and philosopher george santayana those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it

3005520 no surprise if the palestinians demand the return of all artefacts removed
3005521 one of the purposes of my project is to alert the international community to the need for our heritage to be protected from political disputes

3005543 good governance and effective relationship management is what distinguishes outsourcing deals that deliver value from those that disappoint
3005544 governance helps buyers go beyond just managing the risk of the deal to realizing and exceeding their business case
3005545 indeed the capability to manage relationships for mutual value is what differentiates the top providers in an increasingly commoditized environment

3005570 the scale up of antiretroviral therapy is the most ambitious public health undertaking of our lifetimes
3005571 weve already accomplished the impossible in the last 10 years
3005572 we can succeed but our future is precarious the technical challenges are formidable and the political ones are brutal
3005573 creating longer queues in already saturated national programs using relatively temporary facilities where even now the sickest patients still have trouble accessing medicines
3005574 without assessing the effectiveness and indeed the feasibility of this intervention at a population level in low and middle income countries may end up doing more harm than good
3005575 approximately 10 million people need antiretroviral therapy today perhaps we cant reach that goal by the next time we gather in 2010 in vienna but lets not leave mexico city without attaching a firm deadline nonetheless
3005576 this exciting pilot will be a major step forward for medicare we believe that it will provide information and tools that will empower consumers to manage their health

3005578 at medicare we strive to find innovative ways to better serve our beneficiaries

3005580 when we first started we didnt have much experience and patients tended to be suspicious if these medications could work so their adherence was not good and that resulted in higher rates of drug resistance

3005582 potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortions
3005583 early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
3005584 contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
3005585 the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
3005586 still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
3005587 really not acceptable to the people i represent that this administration is considering allowing doctors and nurses and pharmacists that have received their education to provide services to now be able to not provide those services if they dont want to
3005588 whos going to provide access to contraceptive services if the administration provides this large loophole to deny services
3005589 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation

3005604 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3005605 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3005606 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3005607 yvonne had lost against this opponent already at the past world championships
3005608 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3005609 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3005610 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3005611 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3005677 in my view all too many well meaning youth programs jump right to throwing time and money at solutions without carefully defining the underlying root cause of the problem for which their solution supposedly is a corrective action thats why when i founded mygrowthplan org four years ago i spent months reviewing the achievement gap research and literature gradually i came to the conclusion that the primary root cause of the achievement gap is not found in the low socio economic status of some people of color the still oppressive white mainline culture that is in white racism poorly performing teachers and schools or in the inherent intellect or learning deficiencies of students of color rather in my view the primary underlying root cause of the domestic and international achievement gap is found in some relatively recent highly negative american youth development mindset values beliefs and attitudes amp lifestyle behaviors and practices and while our entire american culture exhibits some aspects of these negative youth development qualities i believe they are particularly strong in some but not all segments of the black and latino communities and in some segments of the white and asian communities but as with earlier american sub cultures i believe these negative youth development orientations and practices are temporary and very fixable if they are specifically identified admitted and addressed
3005678 i believe our profit driven mass media pop culture is highly toxic systematically undermining the development of our youths highly vulnerable still under construction teen brain mind and resulting everyday lifestyle

3005711 if they just routinely started offering hiv tests to individuals that come in who receive medical care through the emergency rooms we would at least be able to identify their status

3005716 hay que prestar atenci n a los fen menos donde no todo es comunicaci n en los segmentos m s bajos de mayor volumen debemos analizar cu les son los conceptos que forman parte de la comunicaci n y cu les tienen que ver la calidad a fin de mantener el consumo cotidiano de vino para que no se fuguen los consumidores
3005717 muchas veces de m s calidad que los vinos finos
3005718 necesitamos utilizar programas desde la corporaci n para ver qu sucede en esos segmentos de precios para nosotros hay problemas de comunicaci n y tambi n hay problemas de calidad por eso hay que trabajar m s desde la coviar con la relaci n entre calidad y precio hay productos que ya no son agradables al consumidor las bodegas deben hacer los an lisis con la ayuda de la corporaci n con cr dito investigaci n y promoci n
3005719 en el corto plazo no es lo m s eficiente en lo econ mico pero s en lo social
3005720 los n meros son claros y evidentemente rinde mucho m s un peso invertido en el comercio exterior que en el mercado interno y b sicamente en vinos de bajo precio un mercado que par su ca da en un momento pero que pese a los esfuerzos sigue descendiendo creemos que no tiene sentido que la coviar gaste la poca plata que tiene en esto esto aparecer en la mesa el a o que viene cuando replanteemos los presupuestos
3005721 nosotros en ba pensamos que obviamente el mercado externo deber a llevarse la mayor parte porque vemos que es donde est el futuro de la vitivinicultura argentina ya hemos puesto plata para que el consumo de los vinos de menos precio no siga bajando y sigue bajando igual por tanto esto responde a una l gica que la dan los n meros
3005722 estamos logrando consenso con una visi n de la industria m s unificada
3005723 los n meros est n indicando un incremento de las ventas del mercado interno y externo superiores al 5 eso es una muy buena noticia porque con un primer semestre que tuvimos medio complicado el sector vitivin cola sigui creciendo
3005724 estamos atravesando un buen momento podr amos estar mejor porque el primer semestre fue complicado debido a la crisis del campo pero estamos muy bien desde las perspectivas macroecon micas y de competitividad que tiene la vitivinicultura argentina estamos muy bien
3005725 ahora hay que trabajar en negociaciones internacionales manejando c digos de acci n entre el sector privado el sector p blico y canciller a para que as cierre el camino que hemos abierto

3005730 ahora hay que prestar atenci n para que todos los eslabones de la cadena queden dentro del negocio y participen de la mayor renta posible
3005731 en esos a os se lograron vinos de mejor calidad ahora hablar de reconversi n vitivin cola no es solamente apostar al cambio de varietales sino que tambi n hay que saber a qu negocio me voy a dedicar si a la uva en fresco a la pasa a la uva para jugo concentrado a la uva para vino y a qu vino y obviamente saber qu est sucediendo en el mercado de cada uno de esos productos
3005732 porque de alguna manera uno advierte que esto es un tema cultural cuando hablamos de los peque os productores hay que tener claro a qu negocio lo vamos a integrar ya no alcanza con hacerlo dejar de producir malbec para que plante cabernet ahora hay que ayudarlo para que sepa d nde se va a posicionar y no vamos a bajar los brazos con respecto a la calidad porque la calidad no arranca en la bodega arranca en el vi edo

3005772 artists hate to hear how much their art sucks or how much it needs to completely change to be any good take it in stride and keep in mind that if so many people dislike what you do or have the same sort of critique they are probably right adjusting to that comes in time and it does help you grow i think thats a major issue for a lot of artists out there no matter how established

3005819 nigeria s banking sector is essentially undercapitalised in our view and still operates largely at odds with the long term requirements of infrastructure financing nigeria flares more gas than any other country in the world burning approximately 2 5bn annually according to the world bank
3005820 a reconciled re positioned and re invogorated anpp would be ready to form government at the federal level
3005821 we are aware that some of our party men and women have left the fold because of some certain problems but can be resolved therefore the party has already compiled a list of aggrieved members about 40 persons who must be brought back into fold due to their positions in society and we intend to visit them individually and if possible invite them to socialise in a bid to woo them back
3005822 we cannot underestimate a problem no matter how small that problem is as one cannot underestimate an enemy
3005823 i rushed to the place to see things for myself when i got there what i saw was unfortunate the building was reduced to rubble it was as result of the failure of the structure i was also reliably informed that some people were trapped under the structure
3005824 the 2006 census revealed that there are over 30 000 nigerians in bakassi but the secretary to the relocation committee in cross river state says they are building only 100 housing units
3005825 in fact if you go to ikang there are about 2 000 to 3 000 refugees holed up in primary schools the women would have given births since they moved in there
3005826 we are meeting to resolve all outstanding issues on the handover
3005827 the truth is we are not happy handing over our land or will you be happy handing over a part of your room to strangers
3005828 it is not fair to say that we have not prepared well enough
3005829 nec also resolved to propose an amendment to the provisions of the partys constitution that deals with the leadership membership and functions of the board of trustees
3005830 henceforth the party commits itself strictly to its electoral guidelines and constitutional provisions in issues of nomination the era of arbitrariness is over
3005831 rebecca has her best event the 800m to come and the relay team will be buzzing with confidence now
3005832 this gives me and jo great confidence going into the relay our team is looking amazing
3005833 the 800m is a different event and i dont know what is going to happen but this british swimming team is amazing and i think there will be more medals this week
3005834 some people will say this is the legacy of bill sweetenham but it is not
3005835 it is the legacy of the hard work put in by adlington and her coach bill furniss
3005836 in fact becky may well have had better results in the world championships last year if she had been able to do the training that her coach felt was right for her
3005837 if you have someone constantly saying do this do that thats not right it can shatter your confidence
3005838 its a case of too many cooks spoil the broth
3005839 our relay team was in turmoil it was a nightmare
3005840 no one knew how to qualify to make sure they were in the four no one knew what order to swim in and one girl was told one week before that she wasnt going to swim she was devastated and then it turned out we needed her
3005841 in fact i cant help but have a pang of envy and wish the team i was on was this team because they are really enjoying themselves
3005842 sweetenham had a theory that if you were smiling you werent trying hard enough but now the guys are relaxed and i believe you are seeing the results
3005843 sweetenham took a lot of flak but he shook things up and secured lottery funding
3005844 weve now had more funding into the sport for coaches facilities its taken that long to see the benefits
3005845 he did give everyone a kick up the backside he did not have man management skills but michael does so between them the pair of given us what we have got today
3005846 its the most emotional swimming meeting ive been in since adrians gold and this eclipses it
3005847 the whole team is absolutely buzzing over it its mind blowing
3005848 looking back in the last 20 years weve had four womens finalists full stop and all of a sudden youve got a gold and a bronze
3005849 i wasnt sure if she had got it until that moment and then i came from behind my cushion and hit the roof
3005850 she said she was just going to have fun with it and warm up for the 800m and see what she could do
3005851 its just a bit scary and thats the word her coach uses a lot about becky when she is on form what she can do is scary
3005852 the last 20 metres were absolutely wonderful becky we were all absolutely stunned
3005853 shes just won a gold medal at her first olympics and she knows she needs to get herself down a bit to work for the relay and 800m she is just so professional and dedicated
3005854 as her mum i am just so proud as i know she can handle it and wont get carried away by it
3005855 she has lots of friends in the relay team and she will really want to do well by them which is good as it will mean she wont think too much about the 800m
3005856 its taken far too long for this to happen so well done champ
3005857 the second wheats are starting to look a little bit discoloured generally it all looks well at the moment but the forecast is not good
3005858 we could really do with getting on but its not too urgent just yet
3005859 the rape was truly awful this year because of pigeon damage earlier in the season
3005860 it is also possible that the dog may have come into contact with infected wildlife or she may have caught the illness abroad
3005861 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3005862 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3005863 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3005864 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3005865 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3005866 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3005867 i have a new album coming out on concord records but i havent titled it yet
3005868 im also in a new movie with bernie mac and sam jackson called soul men
3005869 songs like walk on by and shaft of course were real good
3005870 i got my start with simon davis and worked with guys like nat cole and sam and dave
3005871 and we did baby with carla thomas my backup singers worked with carla and otis redding and i did the horn composition
3005872 to know what shes doing because i dont feel like being the teacher again
3005873 im happy edwardss affair was with a woman unlike those republicans who have affairs with the same sex
3005874 these are foundermental issues that were against the former deputy senate president
3005875 the smell of the shaving cream warm water on your skin and a good 15 20 minutes of personal reflection
3005876 promptly arresting the head of the gang and exposing the lies and manipulation of public sentiment by the state governor who had blamed the shooting on his political opponents
3005877 it is now clear that governor theodore orji not for the first time spoke first before getting his facts right his comments then blaming the shooting on the opposition were meant to procure public sympathy for a dying regime now the facts are out and the chickens have come home to roost
3005878 the next time our governor makes another desperate and wild allegation against any segment in the state we must first analyse his comments from the standpoint of his desperation and his unfortunate lack of control of the political situation he finds himself
3005879 many of whom are protected by the state government hence their boldness and operational impunity against law enforcement personnel
3005880 if we look at the terrain that the nigerian economy is you will realise that poverty is obviously still the number one national challenge and if the data of a survey conducted in 2004 is to be disaggregated state by state you will come to the reality that between the 70s and 90s largest chunk of the poverty appeared to be in the north
3005881 if we must fix our roads railway that cuts across the federation and make our water ways working cost of money must come down
3005882 we the members of the cross river state forum in abuja are seriously concerned by the campaign of calumny currently going on against the person of senator liyel imoke
3005883 for any discerning mind following the activities of the power and energy committee of the house of representatives probing activities of the power sector from 1999 may 2007 this will go to confirm their fears that there is an
3005884 this leads us to believe that there is an element of witch hunting at play for singling out our own son for condemnation out of the lot that presided over the sector during the period leaves much to be desired more so when the report itself has not been tabled before the house we wish to state categorically that we have absolute confidence in the ability of the house of representatives to deal with the report when presented on the floor of the honourable house
3005885 i joined delta steel company dsc in 1979 as an assistant chief engineer and rose to the rank of managing director of delta steel even before the coming of ginl
3005886 and when we talk of what ginl did to put the plant back remember we are not talking of a small organisation
3005887 of course when we talk of steel plant the materials that are moved are not your normal five tonnes ten tonnes we are talking about liquid steel in capacities of 100 tonnes slack boards 80 tonnes weights that are moved are of heavy items so overhead cranes have to be rehabilitated
3005888 when ginl came work started from the beginning of the process which is the pellet plant ginl came in february 12 2004 by november 2004 pellet plant was in operation we had rehabilitated sufficiently to put the plant in operation we had repaired the cooling circuit repaired the various high tension motors that are necessary for the operations of the plant and the duration machines the grinding bore mills were all repaired
3005889 we had got to about 50 percent of the installed capacity by october 2007
3005890 until april this year when the federal government came up with the termination of the concession on ajaokuta and niomco
3005891 i wouldnt want to start discussing issues on ajaokuta and niomco but the consequences of the termination of the concession and the action that followed were too much on dsc because the iron ore we were using was coming from niomco and this revocation happened in april
3005892 well we are now building back capacity presently we are at about 26 percent of installed capacity we are ramping up because we were pushed back to basics with the crisis and governments decision we are trying to see if we can see iron ore anywhere in the market to buy
3005893 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3005894 its better to have your enemies inside the tent add your comments

3005921 it was all about timely hitting for sanchez this week who led the minor league circuit over the last seven days with 17 rbis the first baseman now has brought in nine runners in three games in august thanks to a two homer game on sunday in april sanchez had 12 rbis for the month in 26 games clearly he is seeing the ball better of late as hes had at least two hits in over half 14 of his 27 games in july sundays two homer game was sanchezs second in two weeks however its also just the second occasion in which hed done it during his career since the all star break the university of miami product is hitting 463 and sanchez has raised his season batting average with runners in scoring position to 367
3005922 since a tough april sexton has been as consistent a hitter as anyone for columbus hitting at last 280 in every month since at a corner position power is an expectation and while sexton hit his 30th double of the season this week he entered the week with just two home runs the hope that balls would begin clearing the fence instead of bouncing off it became true this week as sexton hit three home runs in his last five games hed hit just six home runs in his 152 professional games prior its a big change for the 2007 10th round pick whose four rbi performance on sunday were a career high while sexton is hitting 339 against southpaws this season hes yet to hit a home run off a left handed pitcher in his career with the power on the up swing expect that to be shattered soon
3005923 severinos transition to wood bats was a slow one as the outfielder had grown quite fond of aluminum after a big season with the miami hurricanes in 2008 entering the week severinos professional career was in full slump mode as the miami native was hitting just 154 through his first 18 games however with 10 hits in five games since severino finds his average up an even 100 points and his ops up nearly 200 points its the result of three multiple hit games including a four single affair on july 30 severino also stole two bases uncontested this week and with a pair of walks brought his on base percentage north of 400 for the first time

3005980 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
3005981 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
3005982 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
3005983 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business

3005990 reality comes crashing down for these families faced with the challenge of caring for their precious children who have dramatically complex health issues
3005991 unless you are faced with this situation or know someone going through this you are completely oblivious to this tragic epidemic sweeping across american communities touching hundreds of thousands of families lend america has embraced the dream house mission and in doing so is helping us open a door on a situation that together we can address

3005993 this is a very sobering video places like lakeland toronto and brownsville are no revivals such as the bible describes watch this video and let us cry out to our god for mercy that he would show such a revival to us in our personal lives and in our churches
3005994 heavenly father may we see revival and bring it about in such a way that we have been lukewarm will be restored to full fellowship with you help us to realize that miracles are the conversion of souls not the filling of teeth with gold dust it is not the calling down of fire but the changing of the mind about our own sin and our worthlessness before a holy and righteous god may we remember that many churches have seen ichabod written over the door and so too could we if we are not willing to confront our sin amen

3006092 high street retailers overtook their online only counterparts for the first time during december 2006 but quickly fell behind again for most of 2007
3006093 however when the high street overtook again last christmas the gap was even greater than before and during 2008 the online only retailers only managed to edge ahead during february
3006094 given the 2 6 percent year on year decline in actual physical visits to retailers reported by experian footfall for july it looks like high street retailers will be more reliant than ever on their online operations this christmas
3006095 the growth of the online fashion industry has been one of the main contributors to the increasing market share of high street retailers online
3006096 however there are exceptions to the rule asos was the second most visited website in our shopping and classifieds apparel and accessories category in july 2008 uk internet traffic to online only fashion retailers has more than doubled over the last 12 months

3006099 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
3006100 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
3006101 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
3006102 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school
3006103 stung by high gas and food prices many consumers will likely hold out as long as possible waiting for retailers to drop prices on items kids need for the new school year

3006140 het dorp noordwijk bestaat voor mij in twee gedaanten en geen van beide correspondeert nu zo precies met de werkelijkheid het dorp van mijn jeugd en het dorp dat ik als schrijver exploiteer
3006141 noordwijk een der fraaiste dorpen van geheel ons ne rlands oord brengt ons bloemen fruit en kruiden en ook milde graanen voort geheel aan t stadsgewoel ontheeven kan hier den mensch gelukkig leeven
3006142 we spraken over het feit dat schrijvers tenminste n vorm van macht hebben de macht om met hun verbeelding een wereld te maken die niet bestaat en toch geldig is
3006143 maastricht zwolle rotterdam noordwijk en amsterdam zijn te groot voor een constellatie in iemands hoofd geschiedenissen van woonplaatsen buurten grachten straten verteld beschreven bezongen of verfilmd kunnen niet klein en gedetailleerd genoeg zijn
3006144 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
3006145 but i dont have time to for fill in the blank
3006146 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3006147 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3006148 the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
3006149 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3006150 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
3006151 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
3006152 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
3006153 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
3006154 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
3006155 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
3006156 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
3006157 we call on russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory
3006158 we consider that the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian border by russian troops change the dimension of the conflict
3006159 seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
3006160 the military operations including air and missile attacks have no relation to and go well beyond the cis peacekeeping operation
3006161 u s consumers are not buying but i think the great opportunity for us internationally is business that never touches u s shores
3006162 but we always look at different things and try to fit into the puzzle
3006163 you could say ups china should really have 25 000 employees the business is out there
3006164 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3006165 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3006166 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3006167 the major part of our contingent in iraq has come back
3006168 almost all of them have been sent to the area close to the conflict zone
3006169 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict and that of course includes the georgian side
3006170 i urge once again all parties to immediately enter into a ceasefire
3006171 the peaceful solution of conflicts is a general principle of the council of europe both georgia and the russian federation have committed themselves when they joined the organization to settle all conflicts by peaceful means
3006172 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other former yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
3006173 and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe

3006178 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3006179 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals
3006180 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3006181 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3006182 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow the 200 free final thats my first priority
3006183 i started off with the hardest one im just out there to swim and have fun and thats what im doing
3006184 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning
3006185 i showed that im still in form this morning i read the race wrong
3006186 a lot of people are like what in the heck are you doing in that but its really nice to be in an event where theres no pressure on me and no ones expecting anything
3006187 it makes me feel like an age group swimmer because i keep improving
3006188 it is a poor result which has come as a result of not following the type of play we want to see and players deciding it is all too easy and playing how they wanted to
3006189 i was anxious to win today i didnt want to gift our opponents anything and thats what we have done people use the word disappointed too much these days im not disappointed im very angry about it
3006190 de f rtj nar mycket st rre utrymme i media
3006191 he was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought and will in the future bring to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football
3006192 during his 11 years at manchester united he had impressed players and staff at all levels from sir alex ferguson and mr gary neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him
3006193 the foundation is pleased to support the uk pediatric oncology survivor picnic
3006194 its important to us to support the university in its efforts while fulfilling the foundations mission to raise awareness and funds in the fight against cancer
3006195 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims and of blamimg the real victims for the consequences of the conflict
3006196 in fact some of our partners far from assisting us are attempting to impede us i refer to georgian soldiers based in iraq transferred on board us aircraft directly to the conflict zone
3006197 every few hours hes been feeling a little better starting to keep more food down and getting re hydrated
3006198 i think hell be fine for the rest of the meet
3006199 i guess theyre going to take their chicks to the water
3006200 in situations like this we like to have two volunteers so we have one at the north end and one at the south end redirecting people
3006201 i was riding my bike on the beach when i saw the birds were back
3006202 i wanted to be part of this but i thought they had already designated people to do this
3006203 there are obvious signs barriers but they dont pay any attention
3006204 i just think that its great the birds are back a second time
3006205 we live here and we never come to the beach
3006206 wildlife is perfectly suited to deal with its natural predators rain or storms
3006207 but if theyre getting flushed by pedestrians or bicycles theres a chance that could overly stress the parents and they could abandon their chicks
3006208 weidberg maintains the reason for the change in business strategy stemmed from competition from companies who ask dealers to make their bikes the no 1 or no 2 brands sold in their stores
3006209 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
3006210 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
3006211 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back
3006212 tige and eric worked side by side for many years as brothers and best of friends
3006213 he was obsessed with making her pay for what they did to him
3006214 no not really because i was going on the side around them
3006215 the way they did it it was like they wanted to fight me
3006216 somewhere somebody got some talk going of somebody insulting or challenging somebody else
3006217 tarrod lost his temper and got angry he acted first and didnt think about the consequences im not sure myself that he realized the extent of what hed done
3006218 im not even sure to this day what they were fighting about
3006219 if we were gonna jump you we woulda jumped you
3006220 id fight for respect let em know i aint scared of em if you dont show that they keep bullying you
3006221 thats probably what most fights are about people saying you cant fight and then calling em out and fighting em
3006222 he probably felt like if it got back to school he got beat up by kristian and all that people are gonna say oh you got beat up youre soft

3006236 no doubt the obesity alarmists will use this studys far fetched conclusion to try to scare us into giving up more of our freedom
3006237 what their arguments spotlight however is not a need to curtail freedom but to expand it
3006238 in warning us of the massive social costs imposed by obesity the obesity alarmists fail to ask a crucial question why are we footing the bill for other peoples health care in the first place
3006239 if the government then begins to dictate how many cookies we can eat or what food mcdonalds can sell it would compound that injustice using a problem caused by paternalism to justify more paternalism
3006240 of course it should worry us if millions of americans are becoming unhealthily overweight those who are genuinely concerned should try to persuade people to eat better and exercise what we must not do is let the state assume coercive control over diets and food supplies
3006241 we may or may not be suffering from an obesity epidemic but there is no question we face an epidemic of paternalism and for that the solution is simple more freedom

3006320 in the days and months after september 11th americans were waiting to be called to something bigger than themselves just like their parents and grandparents of the greatest generation they were willing to serve and defend their country not only on the fields of war but on the homefront too this is our chance to step up and serve the war against international terrorism has pitted us against a new kind of enemy that wages terror in new and unconventional ways at home fighting that enemy wont require us to build the massive war machine that franklin roosevelt called for so many years ago but it will require us to harness our own renewable forms of energy so that oil can never be used as a weapon against america from farmers and scientists to entrepreneurs and governors everyone has a role to play in this effort in fact this afternoon im sitting down with business and military leaders to discuss this very topic now is the time for serious leadership to get us started down the path of energy independence now is the time for this call to arms i hope some of the ideas ive laid out today can serve as a basis for this call but i also hope that members of both parties and all levels of government can come together in the near future to launch this serious quest for energy independence thank you

3006385 from a contracting perspective there will be no change and no loss of contracts or change in mission
3006386 there is a discussion about what are inherently governmental functions

3006388 the term inherently governmental is very confusing and hard to pin down
3006389 the quadrennial review is being done by contractors thats ironic
3006390 i dont know how you would set up a metric
3006391 the number and proportion of contractors is the wrong metric

3006405 the demolition of the defective sss quarters has cost us n10 million so it is on that premise we are doing this without taking a kobo from the federal government we are keeping to our words as a people oriented government the material experts said that the building could come down any time so we deemed it fit to save the lives and property in those buildings before they collapse
3006406 for instance life pattern and social behaviour of academics are different from military officers therefore to generalise the housing design for them may not work well an academic staff will like a spacious building and open environment he will like a residential building with a study room that is flexible enough to accommodate such things like musical instruments drawing table computer shelve and other necessary things
3006407 a simple design that will put into consideration future maintenance problem
3006408 if the building materials and other fittings in the house are of low quality the employer may find it difficult to sustain the building slums problems and general housing deterioration is not far from this housing area
3006409 there are two basic systematic approaches towards management or maintenance of a specialised housing especially those owned by the government or its parastatals functional approaches can be used where management functions are divided among different departments each management and maintenance problem receives expert attention of a specialist thus repairs and maintenance problems will be receiving attention from the architects engineers plumbers while account department is for financial record and rent collection
3006410 there is no specific or separate department that is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the staff quarters or the student hostels

3006498 even as it receives a billion pounds of free food from international donors sudan is growing and selling vast quantities of its own crops to other cou ntries capitalizing on high global food prices but how much of this bonanza is getting back to the hungry sudanese like the 2 5 million driven into camps in darfur and why is a country that exports so many of its own crops receiving more free food than anywhere else in the world especially when the sudanese government is blamed for creating the crisis in the first place
3006499 but here in sudan there seem to be plenty of calories to go around the country is already growing wheat for saudi arabia sorghum for camels in the united arab emirates and vine ripened tomatoes for the jordanian army now the government is plowing 5 billion into new agribusiness projects many of them to produce food for export take sorghum a staple of the sudanese diet typically eaten in flat spongy bread last year the united states government as part of its response to the emergency in darfur shipped in 283 000 tons of sorghum at high cost from as far away as houston oddly enough that is about the same amount that sudan exported this year sudanese companies including many that are linked to the government in khartoum are on track to ship out twice that amount even as the united nations is being forced to cut rations to darfur united nations officials in sudan say that the fact that they have to import some of the same commodities that sudan not only produces but exports is a source of constant frustration

3006533 were looking at the first c class estate off the boat the entry level c200 kompressor but soon youll have the diesel powered c220 cdi and volcanic c63 amg to choose from as well tested here is the elegance which brings ritzier body jewellery and some minor interior additions but still no leather go for the avantgarde and you get a sportier exterior look 17 inch alloys and finally genuine cowhide the c200ks 135 kw 1 8 litre supercharged four cylinder comprehensively outpunches its bmw 320i arch rival on paper on the road what really stands out is its flexible easygoing demeanour it doesnt need to be revved to achieve its decent performance delivering good response from just above idle while the five speed auto is generally smart and unobtrusive in the way it harnesses the power push harder and the blown four responds smoothly and willingly but lacks the free spinning glee of its bmw competitor it also sounds rather uninspiring kind of like an overgrown vacuum cleaner fuel economy though is good we averaged 9 0 l 100 km on our combined urban highway route well behind the official 8 3 l 100 km claim but quite thrifty nonetheless the estate might be the practical c class but its just as entertaining to drive as its sedan sibling the good news starts with the steering which promptly translates requests into action and is unerringly precise if a touch too light for some tastes point the c200k at a corner and it displays admirable agility and a genuinely unflappable balance the real coup though is the ride which soaks up bad surfaces with a supple disdain that eludes other german compacts its also impressively couth with low levels of wind and mechanical noise and admirably restrained tyre roar at highway speeds we already reckon the c class is a good thing with classy road manners strong safety enviable comfort and competitive value and unless you really must have a sedan the wagon is even better bringing a dash of extra load space and practicality with little or no negative effect to the fine points of the package

3006536 it was the duty of the european union to stop this bloody killing just at the door of the european union
3006537 we need a ceasefire and after that we need withdrawal of troops and after that we can move towards peace negotiations
3006538 we will start with a ceasefire we will work on the humanitarian aid side because there are people in need on both sides
3006539 i can not say that it will be ended today but i am optimistic that in the near future we will come into solution whether it happens today tomorrow or day after tomorrow i do not think anyone knows at this stage
3006540 we have a good start here in tbilisi and time to move on to moscow lets see what they have to say
3006541 first more then 70 percent are involved in criminal activities they even steal manhole covers extremely dangerous for traffic secondly about 72 percent of the garbage collectors carry infectious diseases such as dysentery hepatitis and typhoid so they pose a health risk to others also their vehicles are too polluting and they have too many kids despite chinas strict family planning policy

3006547 het is jammer dat sommige van onze partners ons niet helpen en zelfs proberen ons te hinderen ik heb het in het bijzonder over de verplaatsing door de vs van het georgisch militair contingent uit irak naar de conflictzone
3006548 dit manoeuvre zal niets veranderen het is een stap terug van een oplossing voor de situatie
3006549 wat in zuid osseti gebeurt is een ware tragedie een menselijke tragedie een van de problemen in de huidige situatie is de koude oorlog mentaliteit die diep is geworteld in de geesten van amerikaanse diplomaten
3006550 de agressor in het conflict voor te stellen als het slachtoffer
3006551 niet het cynisme van dit beleid verrassend is want politiek is op zich een cynische zaak wel verrassend is de omvang van het cynisme de vakkundigheid om wit zwart te laten lijken en vice versa de vakkundigheid om agressors als slachtoffers voor te stellen en de verantwoordelijkheid voor de gevolgen te leggen bij de slachtoffers
3006552 saddam hoessein die meerder sjiitische dorpen uitmoordde is uiteindelijk voor zoiets opgehangen
3006553 maar voor georgische politici die sommige ossetische steden van de kaart veegden wier tanks over vrouwen en kinderen reden die mensen levend verbranddden in hun huizen voor dergelijk soort politici wordt om een vreemde reden gedacht dat die bescherming nodig hebben
3006554 somosa mag wel een hoerenjong zijn hij is ons hoerenjong
3006555 fortunately people often say yes or agree with requests out of mindless compliance
3006556 they are frequently willing to say yes automatically without thinking first it makes their lives simpler and smoother but what most of us are trying to overcome is the opposite phenomenon when theyve programmed themselves to say no without thinking about it

3006561 wanneer je als rechtzoekende burger moet vaststellen dat de overheid telkens eerst langs de kassa passeert komt dat over als een vorm van machtsmisbruik
3006562 geen rechtvaardiging voor de fiscus om zich boven de burger te stellen
3006563 een achterstallige factuur is voor een burger of een bedrijf even belangrijk en vaak zelfs belangrijker dan voor de overheid ze kan leiden tot betalingsmoeilijkheden persoonlijke dramas en zelfs faillissementen allemaal problemen waar de overheid niet mee geconfronteerd kan worden
3006564 uit onderzoek van graydon blijkt dat slechte betalers volgens curatoren de hoofdoorzaak zijn bij een op de tien faillissementen ook 12 procent van de handelsrechters zien wanbetalers als hoofdoorzaak van falingen

3006570 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3006571 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

3006579 zoniet heerst de wet van de straat en niet van het overleg
3006580 op interprofessioneel niveau moeten de regels in verband met stakingen en acties duidelijk worden gepreciseerd spontane acties mogen niet op dezelfde manier worden behandeld als geregelde vakbondsacties de regels met betrekking tot het stakingsrecht zijn vandaag onvoldoende
3006581 dan moest er een stakingsaanzegging worden ingediend en moet men niet onaangekondigd beginnen staken
3006582 het doel en de middelen zijn niet in verhouding tienduizenden mensen worden op deze manier gegijzeld
3006583 het was al vrij snel duidelijk dat we volledig hersteld waren van onze inspanningen die we in de voorwedstrijd leverden natuurlijk hadden we graag gewonnen en het scheelde ook niet veel
3006584 we werden niet echt verrast door de sterke terugkeer van de bulgaren want dat is zowat hun handelsmerk we hebben de opdracht van coach verdonckschoot perfect kunnen uitvoeren iets langere halen een wat rustig tempo en vooral geen moment voeling verliezen met de koplopers wat in de voorwedstrijd wel gebeurde
3006585 het wordt sowieso een zware race de tijden in de voorwedstrijd lagen allemaal vrij dicht bij elkaar we groeien in dit toernooi en dat kan dan in die cruciale race in ons voordeel spelen

3006624 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired

3006632 a r ssia pode se contentar de mobilizar apenas uma pequena parte de seu enorme potencial militar neste pequeno setor
3006633 h apenas uma estrada de alguns metros de cumprimento entre a r ssia e a oss tia do sul uma quest o de log stica
3006634 saakachvili colocou a r ssia numa situa o muito dif cil
3006635 n o havia projeto de enviar tropas ge rgia sem raz o mas nestas circunst ncias as autoridades russas n o tinham outra escolha com certeza uma linha vermelha para a r ssia
3006636 teria sido insensato da parte de saakachvili contar com um apoio militar direto do ocidente
3006637 mas o que o presidente georgiano conseguiu foi que o mundo inteiro v agora a r ssia como um agressor militar

3006661 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3006662 we are in a tough situation because georgia did see us as an ally but we really do need to keep good relations with russia
3006663 we lowered our profile in georgia and the russians have also taken us into consideration and did not sell everything they could have to our neighbors

3006673 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
3006674 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
3006675 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
3006676 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business

3006680 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3006681 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3006682 the two events for the most part have been directed against the police apparatus which still continues to suggest to me that there may be some personal vendettas involved
3006683 china has arrested a lot of uighurs particularly leading up to the olympics theres a lot of surveillance a lot of detentions and there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police
3006684 the chinese are really bad there are just too many of them now in kuqa theyre taking over and theyre very arrogant
3006685 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3006686 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3006687 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
3006688 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
3006689 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
3006690 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
3006691 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
3006692 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it

3006708 ive been at reading a long time and the fans were always great to me we had some great times together
3006709 hopefully they can remember those times and not be too upset with me for leaving
3006710 hopefully they can understand it was just time to try something new it isnt just because weve gone down or anything like that
3006711 we were big mates when were at reading and weve stayed in touch ever since he left it will be good to team up with him again
3006712 im excited about the new challenge i wanted to try something new not just in football terms but in life terms as well

3006717 im actually kind of speechless i want to say something and articulate exactly how talented i think he is and was and will continue to be forever
3006718 it was a real shock because he was so young i hated to hear that he had the illness at that age you think about the family and you just pray for them and hope for the best
3006719 he was really talented and ive never worked with him but ive never heard a bad thing about him so i know he was very popular and so its very sad

3006724 during the asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi
3006725 we are trying to explore whether we might use only lahore and karachi and take a decision soon
3006726 everyone here is obsessed with tabloid celebrities and their lives and wanting to be like that just like kim
3006727 you cant turn the engine off and keep the arrows going because your battery will die down
3006728 and when i mention this they kind of get well fine what do you want us to do for safety

3006731 so far this year weve received 21 calls to our 311 system reporting vehicle idling
3006732 vehicles may idle up to 15 minutes in a one hour period if the outside air temperature is less than zero degrees or higher than 90 degrees
3006733 for every two minutes a car is idling it uses about the same amount of fuel it takes to go about one mile
3006734 obeying the 10 second rule will add roughly 10 to a drivers annual maintenance bill
3006735 if every one of the nations 196 million licensed drivers reduced their idling by 10 minutes per day
3006736 about 0 2 percent of the carbon dioxide that was emitted in the united states in 2006
3006737 truck and locomotive idling consumes over 1 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually
3006738 11 million tons of carbon dioxide 180 000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 5 000 tons of particulate matter annually
3006739 its to the point where you can get a motel room cheaper than you can idle the truck

3006741 there is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution
3006742 metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non invasive
3006743 in the case of such cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3006744 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3006745 to scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time consuming and very costly
3006746 the fish net structure is counter intuitive because as we stack the material in layers the energy loss is reduced instead of increased
3006747 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds

3006751 its a basic outline that can work for very small businesses across different industries
3006752 delegating business processes such as aspects of finance and accounting including invoicing or payroll can be a smart move for entrepreneurs looking to focus their resources on their core business
3006753 cement prices have dropped since supply has risen and demand fallen in the rainy season
3006754 there is increasing pressure on shipowners in terms of claims liabilities regulations and conventions
3006755 this convention creep pushes more and more liabilities on to shipowners
3006756 the general expectation among authorities and regulators appears to be shipping and its insurers will just accept the increased liabilities it is often unreasonably assumed that p amp i clubs will take on board liability for areas which would almost certainly be excluded from cover elsewhere nuclear and terrorism threats are two examples
3006757 the criminalisation of seafarers the implications of uncitral and the upcoming bunker convention all of these and more are seriously eroding shipowners traditional limits of liability
3006758 shipowners have so far accepted that this barrage of legislation is testimony to their resilience we have accepted this latest burden but legislators should not expect us to continue to accept such erosions of our position
3006759 it is time for shipowners to work more closely to improve the image of our industry and stand up for what we believe in
3006760 steel prices and the significant number of newbuilding orders placed in the past few years have had a serious impact on the ability of some yards to meet their obligations
3006761 a number of newbuilding contracts have been cancelled and in a number of instances yards have attempted to renegotiate the purchase price and or the delivery date the rate of newbuilding orders and deliveries continues at a frantic pace and we expect that such problems will continue and indeed may worsen over the next few years
3006762 but such a move would only be launched once the sale has actually been decided on

3006774 it was hard to find any conferences at this time two years ago instead the securities firms were rushing to launch new technology services if you could find one it came from a giant brokerage like bao viet securities or sai gon securities inc
3006775 for brokerages conferences or meetings benefit us by increasing the number of investors
3006776 investors now absorb many kinds of information spread out on the stock market even overseas financial institutions release one sided reports on our stock market which sometimes confuses investors
3006777 this meeting was so boring that investors got fed up with asking questions and left half an hour early

3006788 we have completed the bulk of an operation to force georgia to accept peace in south ossetia russian peacekeepers have assumed control of tskhinvali
3006789 artillery attacks on tskhinvali resumed about an hour ago six salvos have been fired
3006790 u s aircraft have made eight flights to bring georgian troops home from iraq
3006791 we are ready to increase our forces in view of the relocation of georgian troops
3006792 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way i mean the united states using its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone among other things
3006793 of course it was right that saddam hussein was hanged for butchering several shia villages while the current georgian rulers who wiped out ten ossetian villages in no time and burnt people alive in their homes must be protected
3006794 if georgian troops leave south ossetia and georgia and south ossetia sign a ceasefire agreement peace will be restored irrespective of saakashvilis future fate
3006795 russian troops are currently disarming the surrounded georgian forces in south ossetia
3006796 we have eliminated the possibility of an aerial threat from georgia in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
3006797 we did not bomb georgias oil pipelines if we had done this oil spills and possible oil fires could have led to a regional environmental disaster
3006798 la preocupante situaci n financiera del ayuntamiento de la laguna se puede ver agravada por la propuesta del gobierno de canarias concretamente del consejero de hacienda jos manuel soria que pretende que los ayuntamientos y los cabildos devuelvan cantidades que han sido transferidas por el ejecutivo canario a las cuentas para el a o 2008
3006799 constituyendo una de las fuentes de ingresos m s importantes del consistorio junto con lo que se refiere a recaudaciones
3006800 ante el inexplicable silencio del gobierno de coalici n canaria en la laguna un silencio c mplice por parte del socio de gobierno del partido popular en el gobierno de canarias
3006801 a fin de que el ayuntamiento inste a la consejer a de hacienda a buscar alguna soluci n que no consista en solicitarle al ayuntamiento la devoluci n de las cantidades que han sido trasferidas para el ejercicio 2008
3006802 tenemos una situaci n financiera caracterizada especialmente por el fuerte endeudamiento
3006803 una situaci n a la que hay que a adirle las consecuencias que est teniendo ya para los ingresos corrientes de este a o de cara a la finalizaci n del ejercicio y posiblemente respecto al a o 2009 la disminuci n en ingresos de algunos de los impuestos m s importantes por los que recauda el ayuntamiento y que tienen que ver con sectores econ micos que en este momento est n en una situaci n de estancamiento
3006804 casi con toda seguridad no se van a poder cumplir
3006805 dibuja un futuro preocupante por s solo y el gobierno de cc deber a explicarlo porque tendr que o bien mermar los servicios p blicos que presta este ayuntamiento y las inversiones que realiza o llevar a cabo otra f rmula que es la m s que probable subida de impuestos para el pr ximo a o

3006890 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3006891 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3006892 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3006893 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3006894 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3006895 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3006896 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3006897 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3006898 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3006899 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3006900 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

3006924 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3006925 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every milliliter of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3006926 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
3006927 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3006928 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
3006929 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
3006930 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
3006931 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
3006932 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
3006933 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle
3006934 this is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans
3006935 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukemia in its tracks
3006936 if scientists found a cure or something that could help not to have his puffer every day that would be great
3006937 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
3006938 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
3006939 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
3006940 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
3006941 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
3006942 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
3006943 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
3006944 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways
3006945 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
3006946 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
3006947 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population

3006950 we found a chemical reporter that detects a relatively rare event one that is related to the action of the toxin
3006951 our reporter probe shows that the reaction is taking place
3006952 when theres no toxin there will be no light emission
3006953 now that we have an assay that senses the toxins activity we can try to discover inhibitors of the toxin or antidotes

3006963 they dont know when or if to begin treatment if neurologists knew which patients were at high risk for rapid progression to ms they could treat them with disease modifying therapy that appears to be beneficial in early ms
3006964 remarkably 100 percent of the patients in subgroup 1 converted to ms within nine months
3006965 in contrast only 20 percent of patients from the other groups converted in the same period of time and even after 30 months only 50 percent of them converted
3006966 the fact that the gene is less active in these cells suggests that cis patients at high risk of conversion have impaired regulation of cd4 t cell quiescence possibly resulting in earlier activation of pathogenic cd4 t cells
3006967 were not sure if what were seeing is a cause or earlier molecular effect already going on in these patients regardless we believe tob1 is part of a signature that together with other cell cycle genes suggests a pathway for therapeutically targeting patients with cis
3006968 its hard it gets easy it gets fun again whats hard to sustain is some ideal that its perfect thats ridiculous whats fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person and looking across the room and saying im still here and i still love you you re meet reconnect you have marriages within marriages within marriages thats what i love about marriage thats what i want in marriage its unfortunate but we live in a very disposable society those moments where it looks like uh oh this isnt working those are the most important transformative moments most couples draw up divorce papers when theyre missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection

3006975 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3006976 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding
3006977 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3006978 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3006979 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3006980 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3006981 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general
3006982 ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients
3006983 this year we had to cope with exceptional heavy ice coverage
3006984 we are happy and content that we were able to recover and exchange the equipment considering the extreme ice conditions
3006985 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
3006986 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
3006987 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge
3006988 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3006989 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3006990 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3006991 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3006992 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3006993 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3006994 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3006995 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3006996 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy

3007095 democracy sir is not a means to an end or a means to having powerful allies it is an end in itself and that end is in having the freedom of holding your leaders accountable in your hands not in the hands of powerful allies if you remember that you may yet keep your democracy
3007096 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

3007100 i like the use of alerts and tweetbeep for monitoring the conversation
3007101 i like the use of micro blogging to instantly join redirect or calm a conversation

3007106 who was the better president george washington or abraham lincoln
3007107 america simply would not have happened without washington we would not have had a successful revolution or a united country
3007108 lincoln tried to fulfill washingtons vision of a country built on representative democracy with the power in the people and impact of enhancing freedom and opportunity
3007109 if the debate was about who was a greater president we could influence the content by having each debater engage in four themes common to both men
3007110 what is the most important role of the president as commander in chief
3007111 creativity and originality depth of analysis and insight about and relationship of the video content to the question selected and technical execution
3007112 the immersion they needed to address multifaceted questions in their debates
3007113 quantity and quality of well developed arguments communication skills use of evidence empirical and analytical and rate of delivery
3007114 washington set a dangerous precedent by introducing religion into the public arena by stating his religious affiliation and were still dealing with it today with obama and kennedy sometimes religion divides us more than it unifies us
3007115 openly expresses religion but keeps a separation of church and state
3007116 but i dont think we should have a secular society i dont think our founders wanted that
3007117 some people say religion should not be in the public square i would disagree with that our founders were very religious
3007118 as long as you dont require others to practice your religion i dont see anything wrong with practicing religion yourself

3007120 i dont know but whatever it is i hope its in service of my country
3007121 i think these youngsters have really shown a remarkable mastery not only of the differences but more importantly on the commonality between these two presidents

3007127 the ideas are there for my own benefit of clarifying my own thoughts but also i have an ideology and i would like to see change
3007128 a lot of it is hysterical and very over the top
3007129 there are some that i consider serious and thought provoking blogs
3007130 my blog itself i actually started it up to rival christian dunleavys blog
3007131 i consider his to be one of the best blogs out there but ideologically we have different views i decided it was time for a pro plp blog
3007132 try to avoid using obscene language and avoid personal attacks
3007133 i think in a debate you have to be careful not to be too strict because that shuts down discussion its good to have people who disagree i think what happened there is absurd extreme positions i think they got it out of their systems though
3007134 right now we still have those same people discussing on threads and it is a bit more reasoned i think the blog is achieving its goal of greater communication
3007135 i do think he is the best leader for the party out of the mps that we have
3007136 i have a lot of respect for him i think hes incredibly intelligent i would love to play a game of chess with the guy he plans moves way ahead
3007137 i think thats counterproductive for the party i think its necessary to have people who are independent thinkers its always better to have an opposition within your own party
3007138 i always grew up to think of the soviets as monsters when you finally get to meet the soviets they werent any different to anybody else it shook some of the perceptions i had growing up
3007139 it reflects a disconnection between the grassroots and the leadership
3007140 i dont see why the workers cant seize their workplaces i wouldnt like to see any of this happen but i dont think that we have much of a choice
3007141 a lot of the workers have been very patient in trying to see these issues resolved for years hopefully people will be able to solve these issues without further demonstrations but im not too confident
3007142 its the least they could do for the crimes that were committed during the empire

3007169 you seem nice i want to work with you but first how much do you charge
3007170 the next thing you know when we come out there are six or seven women swarming us asking all kinds of questions like
3007171 lakewood has for many years been very prejudiced said nancy cedeno who had been working in the township for several years and now lives with her children and husband in barnegat
3007172 the outcry in our community was not about renting to non jews it was about the impact on daily life from criminals and gangs
3007173 i have been after them for months to take a look at this
3007174 this is not a witch hunt against the undocumented or any minority group
3007175 this action by the orthodox will definitely raise some eyebrows on discrimination said carlos cedeno a hispanic rental agent
3007176 how can a landlord determine that a person is unsavory or undesirable unless they are referring to african americans or mexicans he asked
3007177 its a wonderful idea but its expensive i dont know if its practical she said
3007178 it is time for us to go public against these destroyers of lakewood kotler said in a mass e mail
3007179 i have heard many say that perhaps the landlords deserve time to work on and improve what they are doing
3007180 shotgun approach that would unfairly burden the well intending landlords with fees and nitpicking
3007181 to just try and take on 10 000 units in one shot the system is doomed to failure said deputy mayor meir lichtenstein who voted against the ordinance
3007182 it will end up getting the good units while that few percent of bad units fall to the wayside
3007183 we had this all along so why didnt they come to support us then
3007184 but if they want to show it now id surely welcome that because lakewood really does need some help
3007185 id like to see it back before the end of the year he said of the inspection
3007186 we had estimated there was about 40 tons down there
3007187 we now know that is very very wrong it is a lot deeper than we could ever tell it is probably something like 120 tons of trash
3007188 we cant just go anywhere and operate our heavy equipment it is also a valuable service to the forest really we just dont have many other ways to get out and get our people on our equipment
3007189 weve been actively working cases on this dump for the past six or seven months
3007190 we wanted the illegal dumping stopped by the time we went in and cleaned it up the word is getting out that we will charge people for this kind of behavior
3007191 we found 175 tires up there and every time we move any dirt we turn up another 10 or 15
3007192 our main concern is that the little muskingum river isnt too far away and when it rains water pours over that embankment and everything flows to the river
3007193 it really is an environmental hazard there are brake fluid containers oil cans old fire extinguishers you name it in there
3007194 a lot of people think the whiskers will sting you
3007195 the whiskers are for finding food its the dorsal and pectoral fins that will get you

3007209 you put the bucket in your lap and eat right over it
3007210 that way you catch and save all the little fried bits and eat them when youre out of chicken
3007211 i could hear everything fall out when i shut the door i think because its slanted
3007212 we played with ryan dinwiddie at quarterback and got the spark we were looking for from him and hoped to be able to get it for another game
3007213 when it became evident that it wasnt happening i just felt it was time to go back to who i believe to be our no 1 quarterback nobody knocked out the champion
3007214 when he was on his game at the beginning of last year for the first half of the season it was almost to the point where he was uncanny with his accuracy
3007215 nothing has changed with his reads or anything like that or his release
3007216 if im saying to kevin if i want you to improve on any one thing its just to be a little more accurate with your throws if he does i think hell back there with the elite quarterbacks again
3007217 its not about what you do differently its about what you go out every week and practice to do and take it over to the game
3007218 this is an opportunity to go back and help the team get a win
3007219 we just need to come together as a team and put something together and try to get a win i know its like a broken record and we keep saying the same thing every week but were in that position right now where were going to sound like a broken record until we get a win
3007220 now the entire team knows that he indeed can win a game for us as our quarterback
3007221 sometimes its a disadvantage for a quarterback to do that kind of stuff instead of worrying about just the game youre worrying about what to call and if this is the right play and satisfying everybody by giving them the ball it will probably be my first time from beginning to end that ill have done it so well see what happens thursday night
3007222 it is normal it is not obscene it is every babys need to have food and be nourished and nurtured

3007242 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3007243 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3007244 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3007245 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3007246 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3007247 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3007248 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3007249 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3007284 miller took the people and scenery he encountered on his 1837 trip to the rocky mountains and created paintings with many layers of meaning out of seemingly simple western genre scenes giving them intangible qualities such as mood and emotion
3007285 in doing this he produced images that were more innovative and compelling than those of many of his peers working in the west or the east
3007286 the title of this exhibition though it may remind people of the popular song was carefully chosen

3007307 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3007308 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3007309 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3007310 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting

3007313 one year ago the financial world changed completely as the credit crunch took hold today the world of mortgages is a completely different place
3007314 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
3007315 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
3007316 the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders however it will be a while before lenders regain a healthy appetite to lend with the maximum ltvs on offer largely determined by the future decline in property values
3007317 with all the above said it is highly unlikely that we will ever get back to the same levels that we were at a year ago

3007352 kent tekulve has been in baseball a long time but his first years were spent as a little leaguer
3007353 mr tekulve played the game for its enjoyment and had the talent to make baseball his career now as a baseball commentator and community liaison with the pirates he has come full circle with his experiences and enthusiasm for little league which makes us proud to honor him with this award
3007354 i loved playing baseball as a kid and little league was my first opportunity to play organized ball
3007355 at that age it was the anticipation of the next game that got me excited i could not wait for the next game because it was so much fun my dad was a semi pro baseball player and he had a great love for the game he was my coach and he made little league fun because the two of us my younger brother and my mother were all able to share time together at the field
3007356 for me growing up life revolved around the next game and that didnt change from when i was nine playing little league until i retired from major league baseball at the age of 42 actually i still feel that way and i think ill take that mentality to the grave with me
3007357 in the beginning when you first start in little league you learn from playing
3007358 you learn about sportsmanship teamwork and respecting your teammates your opponent and the game those were the roots that kept growing throughout my baseball life the more technical stuff would not have grown if those seeds had not been planted little league gets kids off to good start
3007359 its amazing watching the little league world series games on tv
3007360 its been 50 years since i played little league but when i see those games i become like a kid again i can imagine the same feelings those kids have
3007361 i remember getting to the field a couple of hours early to work on fielding it was great that my family was all together because of baseball i was a third generation baseball player and playing was a family tradition i loved playing the game and wanted to get better in playing all stars you were doing things to get yourself better at playing the game it was fun to be better at it

3007379 heres what happens when we have funding shortages the cases dont go away they just pile up
3007380 we dont have the ability to control our workload all we can do is manage it
3007381 minnesotas courts are some of the most innovative and efficient courts in the nation
3007382 but theres a limit to our ability to keep up with the caseload given the current level of funding and weve reached it
3007383 we dont run a lot of programs so it tends to show up as slowdowns in our calendars and were already seeing delays in many places
3007384 what happens is that it takes longer to get everything through the system
3007385 if this were a hospital room this is the point where we would close the door look each other in the eye and soberly walk through our options
3007386 but the blunt truth is that the lack of resources will affect most areas of what the courts do
3007387 and the cuts to public defense budgets will exacerbate our problems slowing criminal case processing and jeopardizing progress in the very areas we have been working on in recent years as strategic initiatives child protection cases and drug courts
3007388 we are asking more and more from fewer and fewer people and feeling increased pressure to limit our efforts to do what many consider to be just the bare essentials of justice without innovation or forward thinking
3007389 any future savings from these innovations will not be sufficient to address the current budget issues
3007390 the cuts we have already sustained are certainly daunting but the financial picture over the next biennium is even grimmer
3007391 we cannot allow the next legislative session to be a repeat of the last one further cuts cannot be sustained and funding of our basic employee costs and targeted investments will be absolutely essential
3007392 our goal in the next legislative session must be to secure the resources needed to perform our constitutionally mandated function

3007416 according to the reliable information held by the ministry of foreign affairs of georgia russian servicemen and separatists carry out mass arrests of peaceful civilians of georgian origin still remaining on the territory of the tskhinvali region and subsequently concentrate them on the territory of the village of kurta
3007417 to immediately take decisive and effective measures for the evacuation of this population from the conflict zone

3007421 despite lower home prices relatively low interest rates and a large choice of available homes potential homebuyers remain reluctant due to eroding consumer confidence amid concerns about employment growth higher energy costs and the overall economy coupled with high supply levels of new and existing home inventory we believe industry conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of this fiscal year and as we enter fiscal 2009

3007442 the biovator is an in vessel composter that uses in vessel technology to enhance an age old process of composting
3007443 it speeds up the microorganisms and produces a pathogen free safe compost out of your mortalities in a very short period of time
3007444 the big driver right now is the price of fuel for incineration which a lot of producers are still doing thats really driving those producers to take a look at other alternatives
3007445 we compost everything on the farm from the weanling pigs after birth to the 500 and 600 pound sows to any of the other gilts in the operation
3007446 we soon found that the cost of incineration along with the air emissions was not something we could afford with diesel fuel approaching 4 50 so we in october of 2007 decided to seek another remedy for our mortalities and thats when we teamed up with biovator and began using the rotary drum composting system to dispose of our mortalities
3007447 during that audit we found several items that we could improve on but the largest one was our mortality removal and the method that we got rid of our mortalities
3007448 the energy audit itself showed that we had a value of about 28 000 to 30 000 a year in savings on diesel fuel alone not to mention the benefits for the environment and the ability to utilize the end product
3007449 we had looked at a number of different ways of composting and this just seemed to me to be a better and easier system to work with
3007450 the composter itself runs approximately 35 000 to 45 000
3007451 the whole composter runs on one one horse power motor so the electricity bills are very very minimal it only runs approximately two hours per day on a one horse power motor so its a matter of pennies per day
3007452 over the years weve handled deadstock on the operation every way conceivable and were always looking for a better way
3007453 the bin composting was far more labour intensive for one
3007454 the single biggest reason was that the bin composting tended to go anaerobic and therefore there was significant odour when we would turn the bins the other thing was in the summer months we ended up in a situation where we had a lot of flies the vessel composting has eliminated those issues and in addition the possibility of animals dogs coyotes or whatever digging into our bin composter and packing stuff off into the fields or the neighbours place
3007455 the beauty of it is the ongoing cost of running a biovator only come in at about 120 per year

3007562 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
3007563 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
3007564 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
3007565 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
3007566 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
3007567 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
3007568 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
3007569 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides

3007580 the truth is that this house is well worth a million in any town
3007581 one of the things that ive noticed is that a lot of the assumptions of the past because the house is in this community of course buyers will flock to it dont necessarily apply in this particular market
3007582 i find that the buyers today especially in the upper end really want value for their money and are willing to look in other areas you wouldnt normally expect
3007583 you have to make your property stand out and get noticed or its just going to be another property languishing on the market
3007584 we got accustomed over the last several years to pricing houses a little ahead of the marketing expecting that the market would catch up and people would pay what theyre asked
3007585 where the market is declining you end up getting a bigger spread in the value people perceive versus the price being asked and that spread gets bigger and bigger every day that its on the market
3007586 its difficult when there are no comparables in the town
3007587 in a town like westwood sharon or canton that house would be close to 2 million with the amenities and everything in it
3007588 its a gorgeous house its one of the most high end houses inside that ive seen
3007589 we are listening to buyer feedback and understanding the market for a particular property

3007617 dar pentru oraselul lacustru va fi necesara emiterea unei hotarari de guvern care sa permita achizitia luciului de apa a lacului siutghiol iar acest lucru ar putea intarzia destul de mult inceperea lucrarilor

3007626 all in all i cannot say enough good things about this candidate or recommend him too highly
3007627 there is nothing you can teach a man like him
3007628 i most enthusiastically recommend this candidate with no qualifications whatsoever
3007629 i dont show them and i know many other agents dont either

3007641 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
3007642 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
3007643 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
3007644 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
3007645 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community

3007676 most of the forecasters believe that both the oil price and the rand will remain relatively stable at current levels whereas the reserve bank is expected to highlight these expected changes within its own inflation profile it is more likely to be cognisant of the risks associated with the revisions
3007677 back home we expect the reserve bank to also keep the main repo rate unchanged when it meets to consider the state of the economy during its fourth mpc meeting for the year

3007681 we have to work within the bounds of what we have

3007684 the planned growth is unlikely to be realised under the current circumstances
3007685 ghana nigeria and kenya are making headway into the offshore contact centre space
3007686 kenya has made large investments in its telecommunications infrastructure and is looking to have a world class network by 2015
3007687 with this increasing competition sas dominance as an offshore destination for contact centres in africa may be under threat
3007688 it was a case of ones man misfortune is anothers fortune
3007689 we get around that to some degree by bringing in fuel from sa but the downside to that is it limits the amount of cargo we can carry which is a pity as there is a huge demand for cargo between zambia and sa
3007690 at the moment we use the third 737 as a stand in while our other 737s undergo heavy maintenance
3007691 that is what our passengers wanted and so we gave it to them
3007692 while generally the global economy has been slow zambias economy is still performing well driven in particular by mining this has meant that demand for business travel has been buoyant particularly on the lusaka and ndola routes
3007693 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups
3007694 further investigation will be required to understand the impact of new risk stratification strategies with particular focus on the policy implications of potentially large increases in health care resource use

3007696 the zar architecture of johannesburg originally part of the public works programme carried out by a reluctant boer government possesses a fascination deriving from its sound architectural qualities as well as from its archeological remoteness the most prominent example was the rissik street post office a wide three storey edifice which defined the eastern perimeter of the vast market square like a nineteenth century version of the renaissance palazzo della cancelleria in rome
3007697 every day of the week market square was therefore a hive of activity ox wagons were parked everywhere and people thronged around the tables on which the merchandise was displayed the new market building a large two storey complex which had replaced the old building in 1890 1 stood in the middle of the square between simmonds and harrison streets it was demolished in 1915 due west of the market building were a number of small one storey structures two tall reservoirs and a narrow tower used by the fire brigade
3007698 yet the structure familiar to johannesburgers of today is substantially different from the original 1897 version the addition of an extra storey in 1905 badly spoiled its looks that addition unfortunately destroyed the original proportions and replaced the charming variation of the roof line with one that was straight and functional dominated by a heavy clock tower and a large square watertank
3007699 for johannesburg to think it is worthy or capable of hosting any prestige event let alone the olympic games is laughable have a good look at that national monument the rissik street post office it is literally falling to pieces instead of being a monument to the past it is a national disgrace

3007718 conditions at the trials end the jury acquitted hamdan on the most serious charge conspiring to commit terrorist acts and found him guilty of supporting terrorism the prosecution urged a 30 year sentence but the jury gave hamdan what accounting for time served is just five months in prison in plain english the prosecution got whipped in a system that according to critics had been rigged in its favor even so the outcome in one case cannot erase the systems flaws they too were on display the judge navy capt refused to suppress a key admission made by hamdan even though his lawyers said it was coerced no one can judge the standards allred used because all but a few paragraphs of his five page ruling were blacked out testimony by two witnesses for hamdan also were transparency a hallmark of the u s justice system is being jettisoned just when its needed most the government could remedy that problem in upcoming trials by using secrecy only as a last resort the system faces another thorny test in the months ahead when hamdan

3007734 we are talking about something that is yet to be ironed out thats why they milf representatives returned to their area to study the proposal so we can put an end to this
3007735 with the defiance of the milf 105th base command to pull put from illegally occupied areas in north cotabato the group has degenerated into a plain bandit group and considered as lost command
3007736 it is not lost command umbra kato is a legitimate commander of the milf who heads the 105th base command he is legitimate commander it not also right to say he is not following the milf leadership he is following but there are intervening factors why their repositioning last friday was stalled

3007750 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3007751 iran has the right to have a peaceful nuclear program
3007752 the west should try to find a solution to the iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic settlement
3007753 the language of deadline setting is not understandable to us we gave them our response within a month as we said we would now they have to reply to us
3007754 concluded in the unsc united nations security council and fully and completely returned to the agency the international atomic energy agency
3007755 we postulated that the president of the united states actually took the advice of the iraq study group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with iran
3007756 im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
3007757 theres a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is
3007758 but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want
3007759 generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid and gates is more willing to listen
3007760 mullen isnt just saying these things for our benefit i think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership
3007761 there are lots of opinions about where were headed with iran and a lot of healthy discussion
3007762 but to set the debate along the lines of to bomb or not to bomb isnt a fair characterization
3007763 the views the secretary has expressed on this issue are entirely his own and they are entirely consistent with his colleagues in the administration
3007764 theres a lot about iran that we still just dont understand
3007765 a lot of generals are saying are you sure you really want to do this
3007766 unless its happened in the deepest recesses of the pentagon ive never been involved in a war game that seriously considered a land invasion of iran
3007767 the no 1 problem we have is where are the targets we still have trouble accurately locating all of the pieces of the nuclear program that we need to take out in order to have a relatively decisive effect
3007768 the strait is always the key for war games in the gulf
3007769 nobodys underestimating irans ability to disrupt access to the strait
3007770 people brush over the tanker wars but the navy hasnt forgotten
3007771 they said hezbollah is the a team and not someone we want to take on because they were essentially 10 or 15 times the capability of al qaeda
3007772 conveyed his less than enthusiastic view of an israeli attack
3007773 from an iranian perspective israel would be flying american made f 15s and f 16s dropping bombs made in the usa
3007774 within the pentagon not only do they see the downsides they tend to think that if someones going to do this they dont want to see it outsourced to another air force
3007775 i dont know whether that keeps an operation from happening olmert may want to do this one thing on his way out
3007776 i for one am convinced that its a very real possibility
3007777 regionally there was very strong interest in limiting irans growth and power that we havent exploited as a country
3007778 we could get small concessions and promises to talk again
3007779 but there were no significant breakthroughs or eurekas that made us say this idea is so wonderful that we need to run down the hall and try it right now
3007780 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3007781 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
3007782 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3007783 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation but that was rejected
3007784 proposed within the united states government in 1962 the plan called for cia or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in u s cities to create public support for a war against castro led cuba
3007785 operation northwoods was drafted by the joint chiefs of staff and signed by then chairman lyman lemnitzer and sent to the secretary of defense
3007786 it included plans for hijackings and bombings followed by the use of phony evidence that would blame the terrorist acts on foreign governments reply 491 on august 09 2008 02 34 25 am reply 492 on august 09 2008 06 27 49 am how about some truth mullahs and nukes do not mix wmds do not mix
3007787 we have the courage to correspond with our main allies for what we see as in the interest of kuwait and the region
3007788 it is true that we are allies of america however we are against escalation against iran over its nuclear program
3007789 merely talking about such a closure creates a state of tension and will raise the insurance costs on vessels passing through
3007790 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3007791 having a nuclear weapon goes against their core beliefs and would be more of a security concern then if they do not have one
3007792 the design and production technology used in this weapon is completely iranian and has never been employed by any other country
3007793 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
3007794 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
3007795 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
3007796 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
3007797 i dont know what the iranians would do without the revenue that they receive from selling oil and so the idea that they would somehow deprive the world of iranian oil exports would have to have a pretty devastating effect on iran itself
3007798 can military strikes destroy irans gas centrifuge program probably not
3007799 this analogy is grossly misleading it neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
3007800 it also ignores the years iran has had to acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials
3007801 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
3007802 iran wants no war with any country and today iran is a friend of the united states and even israel
3007803 it is apparent that iran has not yet perfected uranium enrichment and as a direct result of u n sanctions irans ability to procure technology or items of significance to its missile programs is being impaired
3007804 starts from the real observed status of the ocean and the atmosphere
3007805 the influence of natural climatic variations were likely to dampen the effects of emissions from human activities between now and 2009
3007806 please impeach me let me go coz i cant lead you any more you know that i have been untrue please impeach me and let me do my time
3007807 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3007808 if you had said something stronger we would not be in this
3007809 if you want to help you have to help the end
3007810 over the past few years i lived in a democratic society i was happy and now america and the european union are spitting on us
3007811 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat
3007812 did not make humans as smart as they are today
3007813 the same very boring stone tools for almost 2 million years
3007814 even the turkish often rbn controlled server as9121 ttnet is now being blocked via comstar we understand via colleagues in istanbul the turkish authorities are trying to regain control of these servers and provide direct routing to georgia
3007815 please note that admission to public post secondary educational institutions is not one of the benefits regulated by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996
3007816 therefore the individual states must decide for themselves whether or not to admit illegal aliens into their public post secondary institutions
3007817 it was ugly for a while this is such a hot political issue
3007818 but in the position i serve i cant make decisions on the politics of it i have to base my work on whether it is legal or not
3007819 im looking forward to the state board taking this up and resolving it once and for all
3007820 to leverage our direct buying relationships with apparel manufacturers we need to find additional markets for their products in the tourism school team and corporate apparel sector the ability to deliver top quality custom branding is the key to success golden brings to sportsclick 30 years of award winning custom silk screening and embroidery experience and with more than 5 000 client accounts the crossover sales synergies with our existing operations is significant
3007821 this is a business where customers tend to be repeat buyers managing and growing long term customer relationships have been the main focus for jim baker and his sales team for over three decades we are very pleased that jim will continue to work with us as our creative and production manager
3007822 over the past few years the nature of our business has changed continued success requires reliable access to quality merchandise at highly competitive prices sportsclick has the merchandise buying power and the financial resources needed to become a dominant player in canada i am excited about this opportunity and look forward to working with jack and his team to make this happen
3007823 past governments focused more on businessmen so that they could generate wealth and distribute it
3007824 but it didnt happen weve been waiting for 25 years for this to happen and it never did
3007825 i knew he was sick but someone that young you just dont expect the worst
3007826 his comedy was based on real life and i think thats what really brought him a lot of respect he kept things real and he didnt seem to let success go to his head
3007827 he never forgot where he came from and i think his comedy reflected that
3007828 i was just in shock to wake up and hear that bernie mac was dead
3007829 he made it big but it didnt seem to go to his head he could have lived anywhere in the world but he stayed close to where he came from
3007830 ive seen a lot of celebrities at baseball games and bernie wasnt like that meaning he didnt have an entourage
3007831 we talked for several minutes baseball mostly he was excited the white sox seemed to be poised for a pennant run all in all just a very down to earth regular guy
3007832 to take a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
3007833 at all sort of critical moments when there have been repeated russian provocations randy was a calming influence
3007834 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
3007835 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3007836 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3007837 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
3007838 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
3007839 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
3007840 russia answers cease fire offer with wider assault on georgia
3007841 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
3007842 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
3007843 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3007844 suddenly there was a massive explosion which hit a house down the road from us
3007845 our windows shattered and i jumped for cover i grabbed my son and wife and ran down to the basement where i was joined by dozens of other civilians the bombing only got worse it was relentless and went on for hours i never thought it would come to this georgians bombing us not in my wildest imagination
3007846 georgian snipers are taking down anything that moves even outside the towns hospital which is making it hard to deliver the wounded they are not sparing anyone
3007847 houses are being hit around us by rockets we have no food but its too dangerous to go out
3007848 there were bodies lying everywhere in the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
3007849 grad missiles are falling they are taking the city we are running out of ammunition wheres our f ing help
3007850 it all happened so quickly suddenly we were in the middle of heavy fighting i saw our neighbours house get a direct hit i took cover with the kids in the basement it was terrifying
3007851 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
3007852 i was in the hospital on friday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet
3007853 russia will not close its eyes on the deaths of russian citizens in south ossetia
3007854 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us in one strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
3007855 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings
3007856 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
3007857 we can accommodate that obviously it was not expected but it is something the effects of which we can certainly mitigate
3007858 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3007859 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3007860 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
3007861 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
3007862 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
3007863 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
3007864 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
3007865 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
3007866 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3007867 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3007868 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
3007869 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3007870 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
3007871 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3007872 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3007873 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3007874 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
3007875 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
3007876 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3007877 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3007878 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3007879 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3007880 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3007881 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3007882 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3007883 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
3007884 russia is a nuclear state they are very close to this region and we are very far away
3007885 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
3007886 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
3007887 its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
3007888 to take a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
3007889 at all sort of critical moments when there have been repeated russian provocations randy was a calming influence
3007890 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
3007891 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3007892 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3007893 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
3007894 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
3007895 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
3007896 russia answers cease fire offer with wider assault on georgia
3007897 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
3007898 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
3007899 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3007900 suddenly there was a massive explosion which hit a house down the road from us
3007901 our windows shattered and i jumped for cover i grabbed my son and wife and ran down to the basement where i was joined by dozens of other civilians the bombing only got worse it was relentless and went on for hours i never thought it would come to this georgians bombing us not in my wildest imagination
3007902 georgian snipers are taking down anything that moves even outside the towns hospital which is making it hard to deliver the wounded they are not sparing anyone
3007903 houses are being hit around us by rockets we have no food but its too dangerous to go out
3007904 there were bodies lying everywhere in the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
3007905 grad missiles are falling they are taking the city we are running out of ammunition wheres our f ing help
3007906 it all happened so quickly suddenly we were in the middle of heavy fighting i saw our neighbours house get a direct hit i took cover with the kids in the basement it was terrifying
3007907 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
3007908 i was in the hospital on friday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet
3007909 russia will not close its eyes on the deaths of russian citizens in south ossetia
3007910 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us in one strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
3007911 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings
3007912 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
3007913 we can accommodate that obviously it was not expected but it is something the effects of which we can certainly mitigate
3007914 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3007915 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3007916 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
3007917 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
3007918 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
3007919 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
3007920 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
3007921 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
3007922 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3007923 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3007924 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
3007925 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3007926 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
3007927 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3007928 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3007929 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3007930 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
3007931 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
3007932 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3007933 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3007934 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3007935 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3007936 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3008011 win of bindra has brought hope of winning more medals in the ensuing olympic games in beijing and it is greate victory from one of the youngest sport person of indian squad in olympics

3008013 she had a surgery on her right wrist and it was bothering her right from the beginning she was covering the court well and keeping the ball in play too but things subsequently became too painful and she had to retire
3008014 i saw it live when he won the medal it was a thrilling win when the medal ceremony was on and the indian flag was up i felt that bindras gold medal is better than my teams moscow olympic gold medal
3008015 it is a great achievement as bindra capped with an individual gold medal he has done all of us proud and there is no parallel to this i think he has put himself on top compared to every one
3008016 perhaps bindra is the lone athlete to have won gold medals in asian championship asian games commonwealth games and world championships earlier i am sure the indian contingent in beijing would have been inspired by now
3008017 it is a great moment for india i always said we had a good chance at shooting bindra has brought us all great honour and pride it should inspire all our athletes in beijing to improve upon our status in the quadrennial games
3008018 i was glued to the television when bindra was shooting as he was on his last two or three rounds i was sure that he is going win a medal when he won the gold medal i felt that i myself had won it
3008019 this was the feeling that i underwent as i had competed in four olympics i am also sure that bindras gold medal win will be morale booster for the other indian athletes to perform well and come in the medal bracket
3008020 at present only cricket is getting importance in our country but bindras win will hopefully change this scenario and evoke interest in other sports
3008021 i am more than happy since bindra had worked hard for the last 10 15 years and was able reap the result now

3008093 the words i had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life and the joy of the saints sunk deep into my heart
3008094 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous to us
3008095 come unto christ and be perfected in him and deny yourselves of all ungodliness and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love god with all your might mind and strength then is his grace sufficient for you that by his grace ye may be perfect in christ

3008130 its childrens day back home today and tomas asked me to score one for him its nice to be able to dedicate that a goal to him and it was a relief for me too
3008131 i didnt play well and i have to say i wasnt very happy about it im always pushing myself and i want to do my very best for the team im delighted i got the goal though as its going to give me a lot of confidence for the games ahead
3008132 he isnt on top form but ive got every confidence in him because hes an important player with the talent to match all he needs is one chance to win a game and thats exactly what happened today
3008133 it was a quick move with a lot of first time passes and thats what pulled the defenders out of position
3008134 i pulled away to the far post and hit the ball first time with my right foot it was an important goal because it took us through to the next round and has given us even more confidence were improving and were playing well at times
3008135 i remember supporting that team as just another fan they played great football and fully deserved to be champions and i just hope we can do the same the fact is i never imagined myself at the olympic games but now im here i want to win gold
3008136 my father would have enjoyed that game if he was watching in heaven
3008137 and lets not forget that he hasnt played for four months but players as talented as ronaldinho dont need long to find their find their feet again
3008138 its a pleasure to watch them play they really are superstars
3008139 of course were disappointed to lose but brazil are the worlds best team
3008140 were always expected to win comfortably but our opponents deserve respect they were strong even if they lacked experience
3008141 it was the best team performance since i took over
3008142 if we play like we did in the second half against new zealand then we can win the gold medal
3008143 we will prepare well for the next match and hopefully we will qualify for the next stage we will certainly try hard for it
3008144 we have represented the country with a lot of dignity this nation is important to us so we want to finish this tournament with a victory
3008145 thank you french guy for motivating the usa swim team
3008146 i never lost hope i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3008147 jason finished that race better than we could have asked for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible you could tell i was pretty excited i lost my voice and i was definitely emotional out there
3008148 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3008149 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3008150 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3008151 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3008152 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3008153 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3008154 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3008155 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3008156 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3008157 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3008158 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3008159 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3008160 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3008161 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3008173 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said

3008178 6 for this reason i remind you to fan into flame the gift of god which is in you through the laying on of my hands 7 for god did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power of love and of self discipline

3008180 they tend to be less affected by their grandmothers tales and all that kind of thing and they basically make their decision on what they see and the dollars and cents behind it in that sense they are more open to buying properties even during the chinese seventh month

3008185 it made me think that everything was about to arrive the moment when you know all and everything is decided forever
3008186 the bottom of the world is gold and the world is upside down
3008187 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3008188 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
3008189 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
3008190 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement

3008193 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
3008194 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3008195 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3008196 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3008197 john mccain the american president americans have been waiting for
3008198 some people close to the woman involved rielle hunter say they believe edwards is still not telling the whole truth in particular on the key point of whether campaign money was used to give edwards mistress a job
3008199 with no previous filmmaking experience hunter was paid 114 000 by edwards political action committee to produce a series of films for the internet that included many scenes of the two in flirtatious banter
3008200 the affair began long long long before she was hired to work for the campaign almost half a year before she was hired to work on those videos
3008201 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3008202 ich messe mich gerne in gro en wettk mpfen und habe auch keine angst gegen einen michael phelps zu schwimmen vielleicht ist im finale deutscher rekord m glich
3008203 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3008204 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3008205 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
3008206 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
3008207 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3008208 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3008209 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3008210 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3008211 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
3008212 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
3008213 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
3008214 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3008215 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3008216 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3008217 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3008218 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3008219 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3008220 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3008221 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3008222 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3008223 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3008224 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3008225 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3008226 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3008227 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3008228 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3008229 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3008230 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3008231 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3008232 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3008233 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3008234 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
3008235 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3008236 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3008237 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3008238 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3008239 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3008240 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3008241 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3008242 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3008243 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3008244 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3008245 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3008246 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3008247 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3008248 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3008249 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3008250 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3008251 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3008252 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3008253 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3008254 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3008255 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3008256 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3008257 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3008258 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3008259 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3008260 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3008261 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3008262 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3008263 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3008264 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
3008265 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
3008266 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
3008267 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
3008268 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
3008269 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
3008270 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3008271 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3008272 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3008273 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3008274 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3008275 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3008276 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3008277 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3008278 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3008279 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3008280 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3008281 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3008282 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3008283 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3008284 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3008285 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3008286 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3008287 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3008288 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3008289 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3008290 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3008291 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3008292 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3008293 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3008294 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3008295 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3008296 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3008297 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3008298 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3008299 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3008300 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3008301 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3008302 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
3008303 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
3008304 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
3008305 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
3008306 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
3008307 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
3008308 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3008309 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
3008310 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
3008311 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
3008312 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
3008313 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
3008314 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
3008315 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
3008316 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
3008317 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3008318 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3008319 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3008320 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3008321 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3008322 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3008323 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3008324 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3008325 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3008326 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3008327 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3008328 just so you all know we did set a record
3008329 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3008330 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3008331 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3008332 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3008333 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3008334 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3008335 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3008336 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3008337 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3008338 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3008339 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3008340 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3008341 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3008342 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3008343 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3008344 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3008345 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3008346 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3008347 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3008348 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3008349 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3008350 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3008351 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3008352 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3008353 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3008354 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3008355 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3008356 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3008357 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3008358 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3008359 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3008360 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3008361 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3008362 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3008363 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3008364 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3008365 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3008366 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3008367 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3008368 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3008369 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3008370 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3008371 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3008372 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3008373 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3008374 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3008375 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3008376 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3008377 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3008378 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3008379 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3008380 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3008381 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3008382 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3008383 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3008384 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3008385 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3008386 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3008387 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3008388 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3008389 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3008390 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3008391 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3008392 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3008393 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3008394 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3008395 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3008396 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3008397 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3008398 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3008399 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3008400 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3008401 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3008402 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3008403 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
3008404 this is a challenge for climate modelers we dont fully understand it
3008405 if we knew the answer to things like this one would have more confidence
3008406 the whole notion that something outside has to cause a change is absurd
3008407 weve looked at the sun volcanoes are not doing anything weird the oceans can dump heat into the atmosphere but theyre getting warmer too
3008408 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3008409 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3008410 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3008411 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3008412 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3008413 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3008414 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3008415 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3008416 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3008417 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3008418 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3008419 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3008420 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3008421 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3008422 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3008423 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3008424 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3008425 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3008426 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3008427 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3008428 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3008429 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3008430 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3008431 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3008432 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3008433 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3008434 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3008435 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3008436 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3008437 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3008438 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3008439 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3008440 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3008441 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3008442 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3008443 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3008444 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3008445 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3008446 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3008447 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3008448 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3008449 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3008450 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
3008451 she thought she deserved parity and shes got a point
3008452 i watch this show every day everybody has issues with a lot of chatter back here pay attention one minute
3008453 were going to be the most successful company in radio
3008454 were going to be bigger than clear channel because were growing and theyre going the other way
3008455 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3008456 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3008457 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3008458 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3008459 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3008460 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3008461 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3008462 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3008463 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3008464 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3008465 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3008466 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
3008467 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3008468 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3008469 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3008470 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3008471 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3008472 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3008473 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3008474 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3008475 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3008476 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3008477 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3008478 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3008479 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3008480 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3008481 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3008482 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3008483 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3008484 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3008485 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3008486 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3008487 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3008488 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
3008489 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
3008490 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
3008491 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
3008492 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
3008493 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
3008494 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
3008495 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3008496 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3008497 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3008498 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3008499 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3008500 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3008501 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3008502 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3008503 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3008504 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3008505 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3008506 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3008507 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3008508 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3008509 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3008510 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3008511 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3008512 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3008513 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3008514 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3008515 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3008516 be grateful when the sun rises in the morning and shines through your window into your eyes its a sign that youre alive for yet another wonderful and magnificent day

3008522 tiada seorang mumin yang ditimpa musibah kesulitan penyakit kesedihan sampai pun duri yang menusuk kecuali alloh menghapus dosa dosanya
3008523 barangsiapa yang dikehendaki alloh menjadi orang baik maka dia akan diuji dengan musibah
3008524 apabila alloh mencintai hamba nya maka dia akan diuji dengan musibah agar alloh mendengar permohonannya dengan rendah hati

3008526 barangsiapa diuji lalu bersabar diberi nikmat lalu bersyukur dizholimi lalu memaafkan melakukan kezholiman lalu beristighfar maka dia akan memperoleh keselamatan dari siksa alloh dan mereka itulah golongan orang orang yang memperoleh hidayah

3008541 he is able to separate out surrounding negative energy which allows people to have a clearer perception of their own options and choices
3008542 i knew he was a friend of ms hunter and he asked me to come and meet with them and i said no
3008543 i said whats the purpose of the meeting and the bottom line was that he said the purpose of the meeting was she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk wanted me to talk to him and to her about what their circumstances were
3008544 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
3008545 i really think it is a vindication for the system
3008546 this case is not a vindication of the military commission system
3008547 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3008548 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3008549 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3008550 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3008551 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight

3008554 it all went pretty well there were a lot of people there and there was a tremendous atmosphere it was really good
3008555 i dont know how much money weve made yet for the air ambulance but we raised 18 000 last year so i would think we have raised somewhere in that region again
3008556 garys crew chief gary cogswell come on board and turned our nationwide program around
3008557 the car was good there were a lot of good cars the race ran the way it needed to for us and we took the checkered flag and were all here extremely happy about it
3008558 its been about 12 years weve finished second about 12 times in that time and have come so close you know its important to note that kingsford and clorox and those folks that stuck with us through all of those 12 years and i think thats the most special thing for me is were finally going to send a trophy to oakland california to all of those guys and thank them for being so loyal for believing in marcos for believing in us and were excited to just now that weve got some momentum to keep doing it
3008559 i guess nine laps from the end i saw the guys in the pits and they said we may have a tire going down and i thought i just cant believe it i cant believe it no way but he stayed out it wasnt a flat tire guys started running out of gas i thought maybe the cards are going to fall our way this time maybe its going to happen not until he takes the checkered flag do you really believe were really thrilled to be here you just cant imagine what its like
3008560 i want to thank jodi and tad for the opportunity to be a part of this team it was a great race for us today marcos did a great job he had a top five race car i dont know whether he had a winning race car but gary made some great calls from the box and marcos really believed
3008561 it feels like a weight off my shoulders it really does
3008562 of course i was concerned i wouldnt have said that
3008563 well its 14 hours in front and tasmania doesnt get the telecast this race because its an
3008564 so many people have an interest in what im doing over here in america a lot of australian fans
3008565 i was prepared to sit on the sidelines for two years and when i came to america luckily i had enough smoke and mirrors for tad to sign me up before i came across but i was prepared to come over here for two years without a ride and just turn up in
3008566 im going to have a clear view of probably 1 oclock in the morning
3008567 i just hope i can make the most of it it is very special to drive for the wood brothers theyre historically one of the most famous teams i remember them growing up i read a lot about them with their race wins here in nascar and i want to do well for them and play my part in getting them back on track theyve had a tough year and they need some momentum to move them forward and i hope i can help them do that
3008568 its not every day you can say you topped the charts at the cup level were really pleased with that we had a good test last week we felt we had something for them
3008569 thats pretty cool running for the wood brothers the air force motorcraft and little debbie who are supporting this program its a real privilege to drive for the wood brothers and i just hope i can play my part in getting them back on track
3008570 yeah i said to the guys right now to forget about lap times make it comfortable because im going to have to be aggressive to drive past some cars and we might not have the fastest piece tomorrow because were going to set it up to be more comfortable so i can race it well were going to have to be smart out there i want to finish the race for them and get them some momentum
3008571 well im not very patient anyway so were in trouble
3008572 i learned a lot this weekend and i picked up a whole lot through the whole race
3008573 dave rogers made an awesome call on our fuel mileage and that got us the finish we ended up with ill take what i learned and be happy with it im glad ive got something to go back to next time we race here
3008574 i wasnt feeling very confident in myself at one point during the race but dave worked really hard to pick me up
3008575 i think we got a really good points day out of it after that whole mess it turned out to be a race of survival and a race of fuel mileage thats what it came down to and ive got to hand it to the team for staying behind me we picked up a ton from the beginning of the race to the end of the race thats the positive we leave here with im glad i learned a lot but im also glad its over im looking forward to running the ovals again
3008576 we try to be optimistic with him but we try to be realistic too there were a lot of great race car drivers here joeys amongst the best he just needs more seat time here he came here not knowing where the turns are where the curbs are it was something different and we havent had the best watkins glen package either if you look back over the years the 20 car really hasnt been that strong here so im not going to blame anything on the driver this gamestop toyota camry race team did really really well today we made the best of it we got a top 10 out of it the driver learned a lot joey was fastest at the end of the day when we got here my goal was to get better from the time we unloaded to the time we loaded id say that goal was satisfied so im really proud of this effort well take it and go on to michigan
3008577 nothing would have more impact on the economy and the price of oil than his election as president
3008578 there would be a boost of 1 000 points on the stock market the first week after hes elected this would be better than a chicken in every pot
3008579 we have a longtime partnership with make a wish so this provides a great opportunity for showing our support for the important work they do
3008580 not only can we help make a childs wish come true were betting on greg to bring home the checkered flag so we can help the make a wish organization help other children in need
3008581 i was reminded again that we were tied for the longest qualifying streak in funny car with tony pedregon and thats something to be proud of
3008582 so we need to throw them in and we have to do it under race conditions
3008583 im glad we got in as weve seen from this year you can win from any position this category is so tough right now but the napa guys time and time again have put a good car under ace and he was able to make the right calls and then its my job not to mess up as a driver so im glad i didnt
3008584 we just focused on getting balance in the car so he ambrose can maneuver in between other cars well
3008585 yeah i said to the guys right now to forget about lap times make it comfortable because im going to have to be aggressive to drive past some cars and we might not have the fastest piece tomorrow because were going to set it up to be more comfortable so i can race it well were going to have to be smart out there i want to finish the race for them and get them some momentum in a 43 car field its a long way from the first row to the last but id like to think that our little debbie ford will be one to watch its going to be a big challenge but i cannot wait im pumped because this is a great team that never gives up so we are looking forward to this challenge
3008586 its one of those things where every time we make a good run right off the bat on friday the fram dragster seems to make good runs throughout qualifying and it has this weekend
3008587 to go out there and run four very consistent numbers and bring it back without hurting anything gives you confidence
3008588 obviously wed like to go out and win this race but we need certain people to go out a little bit early if we want to move up in the points this fram top fuel dragster just keeps getting more and more consistent thanks to crew chief mike green and assistant crew chief neal strausbaugh
3008589 first round tomorrow is i think without question our biggest round this year
3008590 what a momentum shift today was for us after having a tough day on friday ive said it all year that thats whats so great about this sport you get to experience so many highs and lows and to come off of a frustrating friday night and i emphasize the frustrating part our performance today shows that were ready for tomorrow and to take on the field
3008591 i know chris cunningham crew chief has been trying some different things in qualifying because of the testing ban
3008592 in this sport its easy to get lost because youre dealing with such minor adjustments and you can lose your way to a certain degree
3008593 chris told me today that he doesnt sleep well at night when we dont qualify on friday and that what he wanted to do to the car came to him at 4 oclock this morning
3008594 and it was a pretty dramatic change that we made in the bell housing we were a little cautious our first run down the track because we werent in the show and we posted one of the quicker times of the session chris said that he wanted to run a 4 27 the second time down the track so to go out and run a 4 24 in the heat going into sunday is just a huge confidence builder for the team
3008595 im as much a fan as i am a driver our here and to see the way the ladder shakes out its almost kind of destiny the way it works out
3008596 were looking at tomorrows run as one that could be a defining moment for our championship run and im excited to be a part of it
3008597 with this being my first year this is the first time that ive ever been faced with something like this and its just exciting to be a part of this run

3008603 yeah it definitely was our northern tool equipment ford was fast all night we struggled in practice yesterday im not going to lie to you we worked our butts off we changed everything on this truck to end up 25th on the speed chart my hat is off to all these guys matt puccia crew chief and everybody on this crew for helping out this weekend we had a really good truck we had a flat tire halfway through and that kind of got us behind so we were kind of put in a box and had to really work to get track position we didnt take any tires at the end we were a little bit too tight because we didnt get an adjustment on it its frustrating to lose one three laps from the end it seems like me and johnny have had a lot of close battles this year it was good run for us
3008604 yeah me and johnny have had a couple of close finishes right at the end of the races this year it seems we were just out of tires at the end matt puccia and all the guys did a great job with this northern tool equipment ford we had a flat tire about halfway through and that really kind of put us behind track position was really important clean air seemed like it was worth everything you didnt have to have the best truck but as long as you were out front it seemed like you could really kind of run away with it i knew once i got out there i had to keep the thing on the bottom there wasnt too much of a top groove out there tonight especially in turns three and four i was just expecting the 30 todd bodine and the 23 johnny benson to be just like mine when i was in traffic tight behind other guys and they were and i was doing my best to keep johnny back there we obviously didnt have the fastest truck at the end but we were able to hold them off for a while once you got that little bit of clean air on the nose he was able to get by us and that made the difference
3008605 johnny had a really good truck at the end he was pretty fast but he kind of had the same problem we did i noticed earlier in the race that he didnt have the track position i definitely knew he was coming when him and todd got to battle that gave me a little bit of breathing room but as soon as he cleared todd he ran right up on my back bumper i knew he was there i just knew i just had to keep that thing on the bottom and keep him behind me but not taking tires at the end and not getting an adjustment made the difference for us we were just a little bit too tight and i couldnt roll the center as good as johnny could and thats where he was able to beat me it seemed like he just backed off a little bit and he beat me through the center and got underneath me coming off the corner we just werent as good as him at the end
3008606 yeah it was quite a bit but having practiced last night at 6 45 to 8 oclock kind of gave us an idea of what was going to happen once the race got going because we started at about the same time we were able to make adjustments yesterday that helped us out tonight i think matt puccia and all the guys did a really good job keeping up with the truck on the pit stops it was just that last one we needed the track position and couldnt afford to do an adjustment on it we took two seconds worth of fuel to get back out there in second had we had time we would have made a track bar adjustment and got it a little bit better we just didnt have that luxury at the end and we needed the track position more than we needed that adjustment had we had the chance to do that we would have been real good
3008607 it was a good run for the whole no 6 con way freight ford f 150 team we qualified fourth and it seemed like everybody and their brother was trying to wreck in front of us so a lot of times we just had to check up and we fell back to 11th or 12th there at the start i thought mike skinner was going to wreck i guess with the season weve been having weve just been trying to avoid those wrecks and luckily we finally did that we stayed out of the wrecks we had brake problems the whole night im not sure exactly what happened but our pedal got real long if not for that i thought we would have something maybe to challenge those guys further up in the field all in all it was a great night my pit guys did a great job on pit road and theyve been working real hard on that we had some great stops hats off to them they did a big part of this we came in 13th the first time and came out sixth or something like that those guys did a heck of a job its nice to finish up in the top 10 i wish we could have finished in the top five but jack sprague was pretty fast there at the end all in all a good night for us
3008608 a lot of it was the 8 truck decided to run into our door for some reason we were going four wide at one point and i dont know exactly why we were doing that but we were four wide and the no 08 truck came across our nose and i thought that was going to end our night luckily it didnt we kept on digging it seemed like a lot of those guys were driving real sideways and getting jacked sideways theyre running pretty hard but it worked out for us in the end
3008609 i dont know what happened i need to see a replay to see what happened all i know was that i told two wide on the bottom so i gave the bottom guy some room and the next thing i know i felt a hit in the back end and i spun around then i saw about three more trucks wrecking i dont know who got in the back of us or what it was something caused us to go around and we were just out there making laps im proud of my guys on this air force ford f 150 team they did a great job getting the truck ready for me this weekend
3008610 we had a fast truck we had a little bit of a fender bender at the start of the race i bent the left front fender in a little bit we got to the pits and got that taken care of and unfortunately they had already thrown the green we were doing all we could do to stay on the lead lap we had a really fast truck with the times i was running out there we were running some times up there with leader its just real unfortunate because we were coming up through the traffic on the restart i just got behind some guys and they got tangled up there was just nowhere for me to go because i was already packed in this is unfortunate the guys at roush fenway gave us a real fast truck and ive got to thank my sponsor zaxbys today weve got to keep our heads up well come back and get them next time
3008611 i dont really know what happened the circle bar guys they give me very very good race trucks week in and week out and every once in a while in every sport whether its basketball football or auto racing you miss tonight was a night that the maxx force ford just missed my guys have a great attitude and a great heart we stopped six or seven times we had to go behind pit wall move the rear and did not lose a lap im very proud of my guys on that they were able to get me behind the wall jack it up put it on a jack stand move the rear end and get me back out without losing a lap it was a very very hard fought night for my guys its just not what the maxx force ford was looking for we are a good team we just had an off night
3008612 the black flag early on somebody checked up on the initial start somebody looked liked they missed a shift and a bunch of people kind of scattered i went down to the bottom side i waited to not pass the 16 and then i hit the gas and maybe i mistimed it im not going to say it was a bad call when somebody misses a shift they always get some leniency i guess that person didnt miss enough of a shift to make it legit but gator he builds our transmissions and he builds me great restart and start transmissions so we do have really nice stuff on restarts if you watch our restarts all year i pass a person every restart at least one sometimes nine maybe i just got too good of a start when somebody kind of missed a shift thats all right it didnt hurt us because we got the early caution so we didnt go down a lap and we could do it under caution it didnt hurt us in the end
3008613 no because i ran way behind anybody in clean air and it didnt help me or hurt me it may have been for the guys that had a good truck tonight but with our struggles it didnt matter having clean or dirty air dirty air meant i was at least trying to pass people
3008614 i e mailed kanaans assistant and told her we were coming to the kentucky race from indianapolis and asked if she could do me a favor
3008615 i asked if she would put the engagement ring in a glove so when tony gave it to her i would ask kerri to marry me
3008616 i thought maybe tk had lost his wedding ring in the finger of the glove
3008617 paul dana was a hero to so many as an irl driver a personality and an advocate for biofuels he made a difference and was an inspiration in a very short time indiana has become a national leader in the biofuels industry today we recognize the states corn and soybean farmers who have helped indiana achieve such success
3008618 what a day i think we tried to play it kind of safe and just be conservative even in traffic we really didnt rush things the car was fantastic we didnt have as much speed actually as we thought we did especially in practice and qualifying the car was super fast we had a couple of guys that definitely sped up with vitor meira and marco andretti toward the end their cars were very fast it was strategy in the end it was crazy there was no way we were going to catch him he was half the track ahead of us i knew our car was probably quicker than his but not 20 miles per hour faster it was nice to get it the way we did i think about the run that dario franchitti had for the championship last season and its nice to be able to be in that position after how we lost it last year
3008619 we took a chance i cant believe how close we were coming out of the last turn the fuel pressure went on and i started to lift i was just a few hundred yards short i have to thank tim cindric and team penske for the great strategy we did not have the car unfortunately so im extremely happy with second
3008620 we have got to start capitalizing on these cars that can win these races scott dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win this race and i think it is just unfortunate
3008621 today was good i think we were actually a little light at the beginning of the race but we were ahead so that actually offset it everyone did a good job and we cant complain everyone wanted to win and we put ourselves into position to do that it was a good finish and this gives us momentum going into the next race and the rest of the season we gained points and we gained everything else so we are happy that we had an overall good day even though we would have liked to see the win
3008622 it was a very competitive race and i am really happy for scott dixon and all the guys at target chip ganassi i was having trouble finding speed and tony kanaan just wasnt going to let me have it easy but thats good racing i didnt seem to quite have enough it was a good race we lost a lot of spots in the pits on that last one and it is difficult to get them back it seemed i had it going pretty good in the draft but when i got outside i wasnt quite quick enough it was a competitive race and it seemed like we rode pretty well just a little bit short
3008623 it was fun clean racing out there tonight i raced hard with hideki mutoh and tk tony kanaan dan wheldon and ryan hunter reay i should be happier with a sixth place finish than i am but we came here really wanting to get on the podium or battle for a win it was a good day and we made up some ground on points a couple of the other cars were a little quicker than me late in the race we may have had a little too much downforce in the car late in the race when the track was in the shadows but the menards car was a really good car tonight its a good finish to get on an oval and score some points how well just head go to sonoma and detroit and figure out how to do the same
3008624 team penske did a great job today we had a solid consistent run and the car was handling very well it was definitely fun out there there was a lot of side by side racing and it really was quite exciting i think we had a solid car we just didnt quite have to speed to run in the top three or four we wouldve liked a bit higher finish but the important thing is we earned some valuable points out there and maintain our fifth place standing in the championship
3008625 this was a difficult night for us especially in the early stages of the race my guys worked hard throughout the race to make the team 7 eleven car better and we were able to get more and more competitive as the night went on obviously an eighth place finish was not what we were looking for though
3008626 i knew it was going to be hard to pass on this track i have to admit raphael matos has been really strong in qualifying and practice throughout the weekend i knew there was a chance at getting him at the start and luckily i pulled that off and was able to hang on i dont know why he wasnt behind me maybe something happened but i dont know the story yet i still had to fight off some really strong competition luckily we were strong enough to hang on to the lead
3008627 i think we definitely deserved to be up there weve been strong on ovals lately a strong oval finish has been important to me and that hasnt been something ive been able to do so far this season for one reason or the other i just want to thank sam schmidt motorsports lifelock my fellow australian engineer ive been working with this weekend tim neff i could have maybe taken a bit of a chance by jumping dillon battistini on the restart but i didnt want to end up losing a position so we held on to a safe second
3008628 it was a great race all of our cars are strong in the front i think it just came down to track position dillon battistini got a great start he snuck up on me on the inside i didnt expect him to be there and he got the lead and it was hard to get around him after that its a third podium in a row on ovals for me so i feel pretty good we just need to get the first place hopefully that comes at infineon or chicago
3008629 i didnt think about it too much until the yellows and it started aching a little bit but it feels good it feels good getting third so for a few hours its not going to really matter
3008630 a top four its very good im thankful to the whole team sam schmidt lucas oil lifelock it was just awesome the car felt so good i could go inside outside once you get to the front its tougher to pass on the long runs i had the best car by far its just that james davison and dillon battistini made it hard to get around them with two cars it was a two lane race i was trying to help james i almost got both of them at one point i tried to pass davison on the outside with three laps to go going into turn 1 and arie luyendyk got underneath me he had the slip stream on me and i got boxed to the outside still im excited about the finish
3008631 weve still got the points lead were first its awesome well just go to sonoma and look to bui ld on our points lead there i had a lot of success on that track last year and i think it will be a good venue for me
3008632 its no fun starting at the back i feel like if i didnt use my stuff up coming through the field i probably would have had a shot at the podium and probably would have battled my teammate for the win the car was awesome i just ran out of time those cautions killed me we had a really really good setup on the car it was really fast i just like making it hard on myself at the start i dont know what happened it didnt start so we had to come back up through the field and theyre like everyone knows youre coming through and the 22 car just swerved right in front of me it was either hit him in the side or spin out so i spun out and they made me go to the back i dont really agree with that its also drivers not listening to their spotters and letting them know that were coming up through the field its just a tough deal but a top five finish isnt bad i guess im happy
3008633 it was a little bit frustrating but i was expecting it because my car lost positions on the start the yellow flags kind of made us struggle a little bit and my car wasnt good on the restarts my car came back to me at the end of the race and i was able to gain a little bit of ground and i was able to attack but i just ran out of time but the important thing is with this race i was able to gain some good points i finished sixth and antinucci finished fourth the good thing is that i am only four points behind and there are still plenty of races and we can improve and are real quick on the road courses and we are still in the fight for the championship i feel great about going into the next couple of races we have been doing good everywhere and on the road courses so chicago should be good for us as well
3008634 its just a lot of little things that we moved around and that was the first run we made without smoking the tires
3008635 i know a 4 29 doesnt sound like much but believe me theres a lot of promise there i hope todds feeling better i cant wait for him to come back but right now alan and phil are doing a great job were excited were going into a new area and i like where were headed
3008636 that was a good day for our discount tire ford fusion it wasnt that great in practice and didnt qualify well at all it just shows you that you can never give up in this sport it was kind of a long race today and the discount tire team did a great job on pit road and we had track position all i had to do was drive a mistake free race and i probably made a few mistakes out there somewhere they just werent big enough to cost us it was a lot of fun i was absolutely driving it as hard as i could and just real fortunate on that big wreck on the front straightaway and was able to dodge the bullets and come away with a nice run
3008637 that car looked like that on lap 15 or lap 20 we struggled through adversity through the whole race my crew just did a great job fixing the car that is the hardest ive ever driven in my life i was driving that thing as hard as i could every single lap just squealing tires i was just getting killed down the straightaways because of all this damage right here not aerodynamic i was getting killed through the esses because it wouldnt turn but the slow corners we were just dominating everybody this was just an awesome race
3008638 that shows what determination will do for you and heart i mean anyone wouldve given up with this car i was pointing up at the sky my front was a good couple of feet off the ground but i just didnt give up my crew didnt give up we were determined to get a good finish
3008639 i never got a pit road speeding penalty in my life and today i was nailed twice for speeding unbelievable we had a fast car and looked like we were going to have great track position at the end the fuel strategy was working but the second speeding penalty killed us we still had a chance for a decent finish but at the end i went for it and tried to pass max papis i couldnt quite get by him he came down on me and then i wheel hopped went through the gravel and wrecked two speeding penalties and wrecking at the end equals a very frustrating day
3008640 it was good for us that was the best that weve probably run at a road course the best finish for sure we were fairly competitive i didnt know the 29 and those guys had as many problems or were short on fuel or what was going on there so i was surprised when it was just kyle busch and marcos ambrose up in front of me so overall it was pretty decent i wasnt fast as the top few cars there were three or four of those guys that seemed to be a fair amount faster but other than that i could hold my own with other guys
3008641 im happy to see him win i think the law of averages works out a little bit last week obviously he had that race won i dont know him that well so i dont know how miserable he wouldve been all week but he kind of gave that one away so it was nice to see him win this week and get that first victory for sure
3008642 just a huge relief it feels like a big relief off my shoulders im sure it is for everybody in this room standing next to us because weve committed a lot to it ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mom and everybody who needs me back in australia and today it just feels like its worthwhile it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain and its just a great day garys come on board and turned our nationwide program around he came on after six races we were in a real mess and here we are halfway through the year with a win so ive got to thank gary tad and jodi for plucking me out of nowhere i met them at a hot dusty day at irp i was hanging around like a bad smell until they gave me a test and here we are brads come on board were a team thats moving forward and i feel like we needed to win to justify moving forward like were going to in 2009 thats just a real weight off my shoulders i feel like were ready to really do something special and its just a great day
3008643 the car was good there were a lot of good cars the race ran the way it needed to for us and we took the checkered flag and were all here extremely happy about it
3008644 its been about 12 years weve finished second about 12 times in that time and have come so close you know its important to note that kingsford and clorox and those folks that stuck with us through all of those 12 years and i think thats the most special thing for me is were finally going to send a trophy to oakland california to all of those guys and thank them for being so loyal for believing in marcos for believing in us and were excited to just now that weve got some momentum to keep doing it
3008645 i echo tads thoughts we were just at a kingsford sales meeting kingsford and clorox sales meetings about two weeks ago they have embraced marcos and he loves them and he said you know the relationship that we have we have to win for these people we just have to do it and true to his word here we are a couple of weeks later and were doing it and i couldnt be any happier i guess nine laps from the end i saw the guys in the pits and they said we may have a tire going down and i thought i just cant believe it i cant believe it no way but he stayed out it wasnt a flat tire guys started running out of gas i thought maybe the cards are going to fall our way this time maybe its going to happen not until he takes the checkered flag do you really believe were really thrilled to be here you just cant imagine what its like
3008646 it feels like a weight off my shoulders it really does
3008647 well its 14 hours in front and tasmania doesnt get the telecast this race because its an
3008648 as far as the field goes it was a real tough field and you couldnt have asked for a tougher field to compete against weve got the best open wheel drivers competing here weve got the best sports car guys competing and the best cup guys so yeah its a tough field and every lap we had to push hard because it was a strong field it does field when you race against those guys it really does
3008649 i was prepared to sit on the sidelines for two years and when i came to america luckily i had enough smoke and mirrors for tad to sign me up before i came across but i was prepared to come over here for two years without a ride and just turn up in nascar world and try and forge my way into the sport i was committed its no secret that our team has been moving forward were now a team thats in victory lane but when i first joined weve come along way since then so i feel liked ive learned a lot and the teams grown weve grown into each other and thats what you have to do you have to start at the bottom and work your way up theres no miracle for me there never has been no ones ever picked up the phone and given me the magical ride ive had to do it the hard way and thats the way i enjoy to do it too is start from the bottom i know that this sport is really tough i expected it to be really tough before i got here i wanted to win i didnt know whether i was able to so i guess i can tick that box now and move on to the next one
3008650 im going to have a clear view of probably 1 oclock in the morning i just really have got to keep a lid on it the wood brothers and the 21 and little debbie who have given me the chance to go cup racing i owe it to them to give it my very best tomorrow so im going to get to bed nice and early and try forget about today and go in and race as a whole new day tomorrow cup racing is a big level and i just want to give it the best i can were starting in the back im going to have to pass a lot of cars if i want to put myself in contention the car is a great piece weve got a really good car over there in the cup garage i just hope i can make the most of it it is very special to drive for the wood brothers theyre historically one of the most famous teams i remember them growing up i read a lot about them with their race wins here in nascar and i want to do well for them and play my part in getting them back on track theyve had a tough year and they need some momentum to move them forward and i hope i can help them do that
3008651 this car has been really good for us its the same car that we had last weekend at pocono i think we will be really strong tonight in the toyota 150
3008652 the car was the best that its been all weekend
3008653 the guys worked really hard and we finally came up with the right combination i think we will definitely be strong in todays race
3008654 a little loose but good we will definitely be good in race trim tonight
3008655 were the fastest suzuki again thats a plus for us and im very confident going into race day tomorrow the schumacher electric crew is doing a great job once again and crew chief steve tartaglia continues to give me a great bike to ride im just going to go out there tomorrow and have a little fun
3008656 the last run on saturday is usually what the race conditions are on sunday so i think weve got a good handle on the tune up and were ready to go
3008657 i knew that the rockstar energy drink dodge turned the corner in the performance department several races ago and its really starting to show now
3008658 weve got the early part of the run figured out and improving and doing better we just need to step up the performance in the middle and the back half some more
3008659 its a constant work in motion and youre never done or happy until youre no 1 qualifier
3008660 im extremely pleased with the rockstar energy drink guys and what weve done but weve got to go rounds tomorrow its make or break time for us put up or shut up were fighting for the top 10 and were going to fight right up until the end
3008661 this is why if we can do what weve done the last few races qualify high but more specifically if we can do what we did here qualify on friday it gives you saturday as a tune up day to get the setup right for sunday
3008662 and if you look at the sheet we didnt make it down the track the last two runs all the way to the finish line but god we learned a bunch
3008663 so this is great getting in in friday is key
3008664 when i came to america i was prepared to come over here for two years without a ride and forge my way into the sport
3008665 i knew the road courses this year were my best chances to win we finished second in mexico and third in montreal i feel like ive been trying so hard to win ive been tripping over myself this is a great day for everyone at jtg daugherty racing its a huge load off my shoulders
3008666 i started to second guess myself but i knew it was the right thing to do
3008667 the guys who stopped they still needed to stop one more time if we stayed out we could make it with one more stop by staying out we gained a lot of track position
3008668 we deserved this win this is a big relief for everyone in this room i drug my family halfway around the world to do this today its worthwhile gary turned my program around he came to us after six races and weve been really good since were a team thats been moving forward but we needed this win to justify it
3008669 its been 12 years since weve won and weve finished second 12 times in that time
3008670 through it all clorox and kingsford have stuck with us the whole way now weve given them some momentum to keep it going
3008671 we were at the national sales meeting for clorox a couple weeks ago and they were so happy to be behind this program when we left marcos said we needed to win for these people and he was true to his words
3008672 theyve worked hard for years for this moment theyve built this team on solid fundamentals thats why i wanted to be involved with people who have such standards
3008673 im sure im going to have to explain this 25 000 times to everyone back home
3008674 every time i go home people kept asking me when i was going to win now i can tell them im a winner
3008675 robbie loomis vp of operations petty enterprises called me and asked if something happened said not qualifying would i be interested in driving the 45 car i really wanted to race my car because its been two years since weve been able to race it qualifying cancelled because of rain its just a real honor to race for the pettys i never thought that i would be able to drive for the king so i jumped at the opportunity before i could say yes i had to check with ford because they have been so good to me this year they ford gave me their blessing and now i get to race
3008676 last year i got to drive for the wood brothers and now the king i told richard that i want a bonus if i finish in the top 10 i want a signed richard petty hat that i can put on my wall i think that would be the coolest thing that ive ever get
3008677 a little bit i think its really getting to know the team ive never worked with anybody over in the petty camp ive never driven the car or sat in it before thats the tough part the level of communication wont be there but hopefully we can learn a lot in the two practice sessions today
3008678 it would be unthinkable for me right now im kind of on a different page if i were racing my car id go all out and take all kinds of chances to win but when the pettys asked me to do something like this the most important thing is to get their car in the top 35 in owner points if i can finish in the top 10 that will be a successful day for the 45 team to take a lot of chances i just wont because i dont want to go off track and get a 40th place finish
3008679 i think confidence and momentum go a long ways at yates racing i feel like weve been building some momentum weve had some strong runs havent had the finishes to show for them but weve had some great race cars i think a lot of that stems back to sonoma i think that was a turning point for our organization it showed these guys that hey we can run up front we can finish up front and i think its given the team a lot momentum as far as me personally coming back to a road course obviously my best finish in the sprint cup series was on a road course so were excited to be here i dont have a lot of experience here ive only raced here once last year so not a lot of experience but i definitely have a lot of confidence in the car and feel like i can do it so im looking forward to getting out there and seeing what weve got
3008680 there were a lot of emotions weve had our share of difficulties in this series getting started and coming in here and that was a day that ill never forget for sure and hopefully we can have many more days like that it was a great feeling and hopefully we can have that feeling again this weekend
3008681 someday the truth about her is going to come out
3008682 a genius idea for a television show about women who help men get out of failing marriages by having affairs with them
3008683 i cant tell you she said but maybe someday well all be friends
3008684 her purpose on this earth she said was to help raise awareness about all this to help the unenlightened become better reflections of their true repressed selves
3008685 rich and famous i am going to meet a rich powerful man
3008686 our solid performance reported at the end of the first quarter has continued throughout the first half of the financial year
3008687 we have seen a strong operational performance on the outsourcing contracts and the direct property investments portfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at the end of the first half
3008688 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3008689 i think he got the better looking side of the gene pool
3008690 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3008691 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3008692 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3008693 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3008694 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3008695 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3008696 heavy and medium weapons roadside bombs rifles or any other kind of explosives
3008697 the only region of the country where regular grade averages above 4 a gallon is the western region of the country
3008698 in this telephone conversation they voiced their satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and in subsequent contact they described the trend of these negotiations as constructive
3008699 nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
3008700 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the united nations security council but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
3008701 it is still under investigation whether it was connected with other organizations
3008702 there is no clear evidence to show the august 10 explosions had anything to do with what happened in kashgar
3008703 now a 75 gap between cigarette sales in the city and cigarette consumption
3008704 dirty hands iced tea garden fragrances thick in the air and a blanket of color before me
3008705 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3008706 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
3008707 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives

3008719 ketika aku menciptakan seorang wanita ia diharuskan untuk menjadi seorang yang sangat istimewa
3008720 aku memberikannya kekuatan dari dalam dirinya untuk mampu melahirkan anak dan menerima penolakan yang seringkali datang dari anak anaknya
3008721 aku memberinya kekerasan untuk membuatnya tetap tegar ketika orang orang lain menyerah dan mengasuh keluarganya dengan penderitaan dan kelelahan tanpa mengeluh
3008722 aku memberinya kepekaan untuk mencintai anak anaknya dalam setiap keadaan bahkan ketika anaknya bersikap sangat menyakiti hatinya
3008723 aku memberinya kekuatan untuk mendukung suaminya dalam kegagalannya dan melengkapi dengan tulang rusuk suaminya untuk melindungi hatinya
3008724 aku memberinya kebijaksanaan untuk mengetahui bahwa seorang suami yang baik takkan pernah menyakiti isterinya tetapi kadang menguji kekuatannya dan ketetapan hatinya untuk berada disisi suaminya tanpa ragu
3008725 dan akhirnya aku memberinya air mata untuk diteteskan ini adalah khusus miliknya untuk digunakan kapan pun ia butuhkan

3008777 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3008778 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3008779 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3008780 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3008781 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3008782 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3008783 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3008803 do you believe in ghosts most educated men nowadays it may be anticipated would answer no a majority or at lowest a substantial minority of educated europeans at any date within the last two hundred years would probably have given a similar answer had the question been put to them but by the greater number of the human race at the present day and by learned and unlearned civilised and uncivilised alike at any previous period in the worlds history an answer would unhesitatingly have been returned in the affirmative in fact the belief in ghosts has been so widespread that it may almost be claimed as universal the very conception of a future life is intimately bound up with the belief it has left its traces on all the religions in the world the elaborate arrangements for embalming the dead amongst the egyptians the offerings to the dead which formed part of the funeral ceremonies in early civilisations and are still found throughout a great part of the world at the present day are obviously associated with the belief or at least the hope of the survival of a quasi material soul a soul having form and substance appetites and desires among the egyptians the soul which was weighed in the balance and found wanting was doomed to be devoured by the eater of the dead
3008804 out of his hearing mr mccain is called the white tornado by some people who have worked for him over the years throughout his presidential campaign he has been the overseer of a kingdom of dissenting camps unclear lines of command and an unsettled atmosphere that keeps aides constantly on edge even now after a shake up that aides said had brought an unusual degree of order to mr mccains disorderly world in the last month two of his pollsters are at odds over parts of the campaigns message while past and current aides have been trading snippy exchanges debating the wisdom of attack advertisements he has aimed at mr obama
3008805 in an interview mr mccain said he believed an organization consisting of sometimes colliding centers of power made sure that a candidate or a president reached fully informed decisions youve got to have competing opinions he said i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of different views
3008806 because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterwards something that

3008808 divisive social issues will be on the ballot in several states in november including constitutional amendments banning same sex marriage in arizona california and florida and limitations on abortion in california colorado and south dakota
3008809 although research indicates that ballot measures do not drastically alter voter turnout they have begun attracting the attention of both presidential campaigns unlike 2004 when same sex marriage bans were considered in 11 states no single issue will dominate statewide ballots
3008810 what were trying to communicate is that a lot of this ribbon cutting and office openings for obama has been establishing an infrastructure that already exists in the republican party in this state so we will be working through these county operations just as we have in the past
3008811 according to data reported aug 2 by the state board of elections there are 1 224 545 black registered voters compared with 1 114 798 on election day in 2004 thats an increase of 109 747 or 9 8 percent
3008812 meantime there are 4 421 919 white registered voters compared to 4 226 473 on election day in 2004 thats an increase of 195 446 or 4 6 percent those numbers put black voters at 20 percent of the electorate and white voters at 75 percent roughly where they were in 2004
3008813 black voters share of the electorate is a little below the 23 percent threshold that some say barack obama would need to win north carolina on the basis of current polls still voter registration is not a good indicator of turnout historically black voters have turned out at a lower rate in north carolina making their percentage of actual voters a few points below their percentage of the electorate
3008814 russia escalated its assault on sunday despite strong diplomatic warnings from mr bush and european leaders underscoring the limits of western influence over russia at a time when the rest of europe depends heavily on russia for natural gas and the united states needs moscows cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from iran
3008815 as a column of soldiers passed through gori a black robed priest came out of his church and made the sign of the cross again and again
3008816 it was the question of the day as russian forces massed sunday on two fronts georgians were heading south with whatever they could carry when they met western journalists they all said the same thing where is the united states when is nato coming
3008817 t he war risked becoming a foreign policy catastrophe for the united states whose image and authority in the region were in question after it had proven unable to assist georgia or to restrain the kremlin while the russian army pressed its attack
3008818 will the united states put real pressure on russia to stop in a news analysis on sunday the new york times reporter helene cooper accurately captured what i gather is the prevailing view in our state department while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia but georgia a nation of about 4 6 million has had the third largest military presence about 2 000 troops fighting along with u s soldiers and marines in iraq for this reason alone we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of and perhaps destabilizes all of a friendly democratic nation that we were sponsoring for nato membership a few months ago
3008819 the candidates responses to the crisis were initially very different in tone
3008820 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory sen mccain said friday morning he credited georgia for having called for a cease fire
3008821 obama foreign policy adviser michael mcfaul an expert on the region at stanford university said that at first it wasnt clear that russia was entirely at fault i just dont think at that point it was useful to start assigning blame the first thing you need to do is stop the violence he said
3008822 the surprise admission by edwards prompted initially by reports on the affair in the national enquirer severely damages his political future perhaps irreparably according to analysts and former associates
3008823 the first time i laid eyes on rielle hunter i could tell she was a story she had frizzy blond hair with dark roots wore bright nail polish and moved like someone who knew how to work a room she was on a cramped commuter flight and she was flirting with a candidate for president of the united states
3008824 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone to text vp to 62262 to be the first to know please forward
3008825 conservatives would be p ed as hell i think you would have a revolt but sometimes john does what john wants to do
3008826 it would provide job training remove marriage penalties from the tax code and support domestic violence prevention efforts
3008827 a shocking pattern of deception i have never seen more egregious conduct by the federal government
3008828 a dinosaur the morally and culturally oblivious hand me down of a disgracefully racist and imperialist government that should have been buried a century ago
3008829 lies prevail in the kangaroo courts of the federal system
3008830 no regrets it was exactly what you wanted at the time

3008848 what really scares me is not just that i remember so many of these ads but that im pretty sure th
3008849 i know that people always imagine me with perfect hair and stuck in high heels since i was a child but that is not who i am at least not all the time
3008850 heavy and medium weapons roadside bombs rifles or any other kind of explosives
3008851 no doubt the obesity alarmists will use this studys far fetched conclusion to try to scare us into giving up more of our freedom
3008852 what their arguments spotlight however is not a need to curtail freedom but to expand it
3008853 in warning us of the massive social costs imposed by obesity the obesity alarmists fail to ask a crucial question why are we footing the bill for other peoples health care in the first place
3008854 if the government then begins to dictate how many cookies we can eat or what food mcdonalds can sell it would compound that injustice using a problem caused by paternalism to justify more paternalism
3008855 of course it should worry us if millions of americans are becoming unhealthily overweight those who are genuinely concerned should try to persuade people to eat better and exercise what we must not do is let the state assume coercive control over diets and food supplies
3008856 we may or may not be suffering from an obesity epidemic but there is no question we face an epidemic of paternalism and for that the solution is simple more freedom
3008857 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3008858 were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves
3008859 there have been national enquirer headlines claiming a love child scandal involved senator john edwards or a member of his staff forcing edwards to issue a strong public denial
3008860 despite its reputation as a supermarket tabloid the national enquirer is the paper that broke the story which was confirmed of jesse jackson having an illegitimate child hence the papers exclusives cannot be dismissed out of hand
3008861 edwards contacted abc news and requested that he be interviewed about the allegations
3008862 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
3008863 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3008864 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
3008865 if things go right we can start talking about forever
3008866 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
3008867 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
3008868 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
3008869 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3008870 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
3008871 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
3008872 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
3008873 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
3008874 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
3008875 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
3008876 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications
3008877 ibms lotus suite has been around for years is used by billions worldwide and is well understood and well established
3008878 for red hat novell and canonical being able to leverage lotus on desktop pcs is a real opportunity
3008879 if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform this mixture of ibm and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either vista or new hardware to support it
3008880 this is the beginning of a big change in mobile computing
3008881 we would have gotten drowned out with all the noise
3008882 we just thought a boom was going to happen and it really didnt

3008885 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3008886 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3008887 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3008888 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3008889 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
3008890 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3008891 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3008892 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3008893 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
3008894 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
3008895 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
3008896 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

3008913 i havent noticed any overt ageism within the digital arts field you can either do your job or you cant
3008914 you make a commitment to updating your skill set periodically to keep up with new workers in your field or you dont
3008915 keeping or losing a job isnt so much a matter of the age you are but how readily you are able to keep yourself up to the industry standards for what youre expected to do
3008916 personally i have a wife and two kids and need to keep up with the rigors of family life as well as perform well on the job and learn new 2d and 3d skills that might come along all of this is much more difficult for me than for say someone who is 25 years old with relatively few responsibilities outside of the workplace and while i may have a wealth of experience having been in digital art now for roughly 25 years if i dont keep up with the younger fresher and more focused folks i might find myself on the outside looking in
3008917 no matter if youre a programmer or an artist its absolutely necessary to develop challenging new materials for your portfolio outside of the workplace
3008918 youre rarely able to use materials from games youre working on your portfolio or personal web site but having up to date code samples or exciting visuals help potential employers form a good opinion of you regardless of your age or relative experience
3008919 also practice turning those negative vibes to your own advantage even when talking to your family and friends thirty somethings are more mature take less time to become acclimated to a new field or company and generally make a better showing to employers than their twenty something counterparts if youre confident in your outlook youll quickly make backer out of your worst doubters

3008938 i was a little worried after i read some of the comments
3008939 nothing against engadget its just the blog commenters can be awfully nasty
3008940 in one recent study russell poldrack a psychology professor at the university of california los angeles found that multitasking adversely affects how you learn
3008941 i always like the idea of using technology in a way that it wasnt meant to be used
3008942 i liked the idea of making a video of human beings and real life and time without using any cameras just lasers so there are just mathematical points and how strangely emotional it ended up being
3008943 in a way the clip is a reflection of where we are in society because everything is data our lives our digital
3008944 we believe there is an 80 chance apple will introduce redesigned macbooks and possibly new macbook pros at lower price points
3008945 specifically apple may re enter the 999 price point currently 1099 with the macbook or test the 1 799 price point with the macbook pro currently 1999
3008946 which seem to be selling just fine as they are
3008947 its super frustrating not being able to access my web mail
3008948 at the very least apple should add a week to every mac subscribers term of service
3008949 you dont have to depend on a password so theres no phishing opportunity
3008950 we need to come together in a neutral body to continue to promote the adoption of this technology

3008953 virgin media and bt have both threatened customers with disconnection but generally isps arent keen to shoulder the costs of monitoring or to adopt the role of policemen
3008954 signing up to a voluntary code is probably the only way they can avoid or more likely mute legislation
3008955 the threat of legislation will stay on the table the governments own proposal for such action will be published today suggesting either a levy on copying hardware a compulsion on isps to filter traffic or a french style disconnection warning system
3008956 most record label executives agree that the near term solution is for isps to offer unlimited access to a large music library as part of a customers broadband package and share in the revenue
3008957 giving the isps an alternative to peer to peer bazaars one for which they can charge potentially solves two of their biggest problems declining operating margins resulting from bruising competition and escalating bandwidth costs of file sharing
3008958 to put it mildly the isps are getting a good deal here
3008959 rumours are circulating that a deal has been cut to allow the isps to offer a legal peer to peer service at a relatively low subscription cost as low as 30 per year on top of the standard isp charge
3008960 details of the deal are far from clear but cheap legal peer to peer music sharing undoubtedly poses a huge threat not just to existing subscription services like napster and emusic but also to the dominance of apples itunes
3008961 of course there are people who dont want to pay for their music and films but i believe that the vast majority of downloaders are people like me who would gladly pay if the content was available to purchase when i wanted it in the format i want it
3008962 it is so boring hearing their woe is me story over and over again
3008963 they seem incapable of making a single commercial move to take advantage of the massive interest in their products that has been driven by the internet

3008987 the quadrennial review is being done by contractors thats ironic
3008988 i dont know how you would set up a metric
3008989 the number and proportion of contractors is the wrong metric
3008990 many times the number of contractors is less relevant the issue is what is the mission and what are the total resources available
3008991 they had talked a lot about it and we would just rather do it in the pool
3008992 the guys are picking things up pretty quickly and its really a continuation of what we did in the spring so its not really anything new

3009001 hopefully they can remember those times and not be too upset with me for leaving
3009002 hopefully they can understand it was just time to try something new it isnt just because weve gone down or anything like that
3009003 we were big mates when were at reading and weve stayed in touch ever since he left it will be good to team up with him again
3009004 im excited about the new challenge i wanted to try something new not just in football terms but in life terms as well

3009023 keeping patches up to date is vital for maintaining optimal web security but is not enough which is why employing a browser security solution such as zonealarm forcefield is critical
3009024 i thought the french were going to win honestly nothing against the americans
3009025 the guy who went last he went the last 100 metres like a rocket it was incredible to watch i was watching our guys but i had a little peripheral vision going
3009026 i knew i was going to go faster than sundays heat
3009027 me going out there that fast really helped these guys were going to keep building off this
3009028 were on the right track now and weve all got more in us weve just got to keep it going
3009029 athens was kind of a wake up call and everybody knew we can do better
3009030 the guys showed a lot of character after the second test we have been consistent in recent years at home as well as away the younger players took responsibility and the seniors pushed themselves
3009031 both murali muttiah muralitharan and ajantha mendis bowled very well and kept the pressure on a good indian batting line up
3009032 i have rarely seen so many injuries on a single day but it is part of the game sri lanka played better and deserved the victory
3009033 our batting let us down as it was not consistent throughout the series mendis was a key bowler for sri lanka and was well supported by murali
3009034 i cant tell you how moved i am by this piece of fruit
3009035 im planning to use it to grow a bunch of soccer balls in my backyard
3009036 i will always carry with me the image of our canadian team entering the stadium behind kayaker adam van koeverden
3009037 its three times the size of stanley park and its absolutely beautiful it really takes your breath away
3009038 i was a little disappointed about going to cincinnati because i thought i had a good chance to make the ahl hamilton bulldogs
3009039 but i wanted to play pro hockey and we had the best team in the league we won the cup and it was my first championship ever it was a memorable day because i had never played on a really great team or had a great playoff its been over a month since we won and ive still got that championship feeling
3009040 i remember everything about it especially my first time through the dressing room door
3009041 this is a great organization with a great history i saw the plaques to all the great players who have been here for a young player thats unbelievable
3009042 i grew up in montreal and my family was big fans of the canadiens we would go 10 15 times a year and if we couldnt go the games were on television canadiens games were a big deal in my family
3009043 i remember patrick roy playing so great in the final
3009044 i can remember every player on that team they were so close to the fans
3009045 they are who they are and i am who i am no one is a look alike on the ice everyone has their own style i have my own style and i want to improve myself when i look at players like alex kovalev working hard and i know how good they are already i want to work hard and improve myself thats inspirational
3009046 i will continue to show people what i can do whether its in montreal hamilton or cincinnati i came here to play here
3009047 it was a good experience and i played with great players in juniors
3009048 bergeron is an unbelievable player at a young age an impact player gervais was a great defenseman for us and hes playing with the islanders its fun to say i played with players like that
3009049 my last year there everyone was following me and talking about me because i was on a pace to score 90 goals at one point wherever i went people were looking at me wanting to congratulate me or bring their kids to meet me now all that is behind me its done and i just want to look forward i know i have a lot of work to do
3009050 i had to get better because i want to play hockey
3009051 i know i did great in juniors and that it was better for me to start my career in cincinnati wherever they want me to go this year ill go and do my best because my dream is to play in the nhl and i will achieve it im only 22 now and i have time i just dont want to have any regrets at the end of my career
3009052 i havent talked too much to coach guy carbonneau but i know i made a good impression last year because he dressed me for two exhibition games
3009053 he told me he knew i was that guy that scored 71 goals its always fun to hear that from the head coach i worked hard at training camp and made a good impression
3009054 people get paid to do that work and i have no argument with them
3009055 whenever he played at the ahl level he has been one of the top goalies in that league the last two seasons
3009056 ryan played this past year as a freshman at the university of wisconsin and had a good development season
3009057 he got good coaching from head coach mike eaves and his assistant mark osiecki
3009058 development wise ryan is right on schedule he is physically close to being ready to play in the nhl he just needs more seasoning and he needs to get more defensive coaching over the next season before having that chance to turn pro
3009059 fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it david was a go to guy for offense when he was in high school
3009060 his defensive game needed some attention when he got to the university of minnesota his defensive game is being better refined he had some setbacks last year he had his tonsils removed just before training camp and he lost 15 pounds which set him back he wasnt strong out of the blocks in the first half of the season
3009061 were looking for him to make the team and make more of a contribution this year whats interesting about subban is he produces his best hockey at playoff time we hope he can continue that trend
3009062 hes a key guy on their power play and hes tough to play against subban has more than exceeded expectations to date he was on bellevilles top defensive pairing hes got a tremendous shot from the point which they use on their power play
3009063 he attended the canadian world junior team camp in ottawa in july he was a member of the gold medal team last year as a seventh defenseman were looking for him to make the team and make more of a contribution this year whats interesting about subban is he produces his best hockey at playoff time we hope he can continue that trend
3009064 i dont want to toot his horn too much but yannick had a great season last year
3009065 he was a big part of why kitchener went so far winning the ohl regular season and playoff championships and playing in the memorial cup final
3009066 yannick is solid defensively hes a really strong technical skater which allows him to log a lot of minutes 30 plus per game that was especially important when they had a lot of injuries yannick definitely made progress last year he took on more of a leadership role and was a go to guy from the back end in kitchener
3009067 mathieu has the experience of playing for a year in hamilton
3009068 he played a half game for us in the preseason and was doing well until he got injured as a result he started his ahl season injured we look forward to his continued development he has developed a lot in this offseason
3009069 mathieu has a solid point shot and his skating has come a long way were looking forward to him contributing on offense and being a strong power play contributor in hamilton from the beginning of the season mathieu sees the ice really well hes like weber in that his strength is the transition game moving the puck up to the forwards
3009070 hes a smart play making center at every level coaches have utilized him in every situation hes a very smart player a heady player with good vision his skating is effortless he looks like he is not working but he actually is
3009071 ben has had setbacks in each of the past two seasons
3009072 he had elbow surgery two years ago and a charley horse in training camp last year that calcified and he ended up missing most of the season were still excited about him hes a smart play making center at every level coaches have utilized him in every situation hes a very smart player a heady player with good vision his skating is effortless he looks like he is not working but he actually is
3009073 brock was a free agent who has really come along
3009074 he was one of the most improved players at development camp he has added some size and strength and has bettered his shot like ben maxwell brock is a smart play maker hes also a good person who comes from a good family brock was on our draft list and our scout visited his family before the draft we knew the player and the person when he indicated he was coming out of college and turning pro we were johnny on the spot
3009075 we just signed max after he had a tremendous season playing on the top line at the university of michigan
3009076 the only downside was he had an injury that kept him from performing at the top of his game in the world juniors physically he is definitely ready he has a tremendous shot and really good size and strength he likes to play physical hes very smart hockey wise put those things together and you have the makings of a prototypical power winger
3009077 two seasons ago he was a freshman in hamilton and was a really strong contributor to us winning the calder cup
3009078 the support around him was not as strong last season and he didnt have as good a year
3009079 america must reduce its dependence on the coal and petroleum products that contribute to global warming
3009080 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
3009081 to be honest it was when i was afraid that people would recognise me that i was recognised much more
3009082 when i first arrived in london i was much more afraid of that so i stayed in but after a while i began to feel claustrophobic and thought we have to get out
3009083 so i went out very confidently wore a hat sat with my back to people and the funny thing is that people would look at me and think is that

3009095 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3009096 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
3009097 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
3009098 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
3009099 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
3009100 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto
3009101 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit new moon
3009102 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3009103 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
3009104 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
3009105 i was involved in the original security implementation on most of the systems and offered to help but the new cso refused our input
3009106 he put keycard access on the computer room and ups room and confiscated any physical keys he could find
3009107 when asked what would happen if the keycard system went down he responded that mechanisms are in place
3009108 i guess mechanisms in place was short for i dont have a clue but someone else will take care of it for me
3009109 within a week the keycard system was hooked up to the ups with a secondary backup battery and was tested repeatedly

3009115 the dedicated and committed efforts being made by you and your institute towards the cause of education are reallycommendable and deserve all the encouragement
3009116 we are endorsed by the mhrd the letter says as much
3009117 many of our students leave halfway through the course when they realise the institute will not guarantee them jobs
3009118 would certainly not affiliateitself with an institution clearly infringing the mit trademark
3009119 we are going to make accreditation mandatory the law we feel may be necessary for the purpose of enforcement
3009120 even a fraud institute that markets itself well is likely to get students willing to shell out lakhs of rupees as fees dupingstudents by a play of words is an often used tactic
3009121 a one time recognition is not enough the naac will first evaluate all the recognised universities and institutes
3009122 we have decided to remove the commended by phrase from the prospectus and from all officialdocuments we have also removed the ministers name from the faculty
3009123 i would like to humbly submit that we shall delete the name of the human resource minister from the list offaculty similarly as regards the issue of using the words commended by mhrd these words have alsobeen deleted from our new prospectus and brochure
3009124 i would like to assure you this error will not be repeated i feel extremely sorry for the embarrassmentcaused to you in this regard
3009125 la bula estaba semioculta porque se emple para encuadernar el libro que actualmente lo contiene pero hubo dos cosas que me dieron pistas en primer lugar la tipograf a g tica era poco usual en espa a en esa poca y en segundo lugar le tres palabras nos don rodrigo y por libros que hab a le do sobre el tema lo relacion de inmediato con la bula de rodrigo de borja
3009126 estaba escrita en lat n es bonito poder encontrar estas hojas impresas porque son documentos muy ef meros que se pierden y no quedan reflejadas en la historia

3009139 the quadrennial review is being done by contractors thats ironic
3009140 i dont know how you would set up a metric
3009141 the number and proportion of contractors is the wrong metric
3009142 many times the number of contractors is less relevant the issue is what is the mission and what are the total resources available
3009143 from a contracting perspective there will be no change and no loss of contracts or change in mission
3009144 there is a discussion about what are inherently governmental functions
3009145 if they are defined too broadly it will cut out contracts
3009146 the term inherently governmental is very confusing and hard to pin down
3009147 sit back and hope and pray the company were doing business with isnt ripping us off too badly

3009154 the key component to the gvg changes involves the complete removal of the victory or death finale effect
3009155 in coming months we expect to see signs of a widespread slowdown in the electronics sector which would directly impact semiconductor sales
3009156 as the economic cycle unfolds it seems inconceivable that we will not see a more significant reduction in spending on electronics even in the most resilient of industry sectors and regional markets
3009157 the freedom to travel anonymously is fundamentally important to our right to peaceably assemble
3009158 and they made it clear that my reasons for not having id would be a factor
3009159 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3009160 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3009161 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3009162 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
3009163 you are dealing with something which most of us wouldnt use
3009164 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
3009165 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
3009166 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
3009167 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
3009168 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3009169 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3009170 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3009171 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3009172 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3009173 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3009174 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3009175 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3009176 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3009177 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
3009178 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
3009179 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
3009180 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
3009181 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
3009182 we obviously have sticking points like in any talks but we look forward to overcome them
3009183 si no hay una reforma electoral la democracia dominicana est amenazada no puede haber democracia en un pa s si un candidato puede gastar cualquier suma de dinero en las campa as es necesario hacer una profunda reforma electoral para establecer topes en el gasto que permita niveles m nimos de equidad en la participaci n de una campa a electoral
3009184 la verdad es que son tantos los problemas del pa s y uno ve un presidente desenfocado de los problemas nacionales un presidente quiz s con planes continuista antes de un presidente estadista para enfrentar los males nacionales que quisiera estar lleno de optimismo y ser positivo al momento que se inicia un nuevo gobierno
3009185 ser un poco m s de lo mismo un pa s con una crisis mucho m s profunda un d ficit cuasi fiscal provocado por los costos de las pasadas elecciones que es cada vez m s grande y con una crisis social econ mica y con posibilidades de que se convierta en una crisis pol tica sumamente preocupante
3009186 a private equity billionaire a former federal government official and a baltimore newsletter editor have made a documentary film that they hope can do what an endless parade of policy papers has not convince americans that debt has created a looming economic crisis that would make the great depression look like a market correction
3009187 looming economic crisis that would make the great depression look like a market correction
3009188 i dont get in her business with that kind of stuff
3009189 though we expect a continued deterioration as the year goes on as american and european consumers stay at home the resilience of demand for chinas exports is still remarkable
3009190 both vista and netscape show that large companies make huge blunders in technology in the case of microsoft they no longer count on moving users to new products as quickly as they want time warners short sighted decision to abandon netscape shows technology decisions are long term ones and companies that want to create value in that market need to look beyond quarter to quarter earnings but the real story is the continued erosion of microsofts market share
3009191 engineers have told us that they need greater performance capability and versatility from a signal source to keep pace with the latest technology
3009192 tektronix designed the awg b series to minimize complexity for users and to provide the performance needed to match increasing high speed serial data rates and the advance of wideband digital rf technologies the awg b series can create replicate or generate virtually any signal and also has the ability to generate up to six signals simultaneously on the awg7000b series no other awg can match the performance capability and flexibility of the tektronix awg b series
3009193 ich konnte meinen ersten laufsieg in der dtm feiern aber letztendlich hatten wir ein konstantes jahr und befinden uns noch immer mittendrin im kampf um die meisterschaft
3009194 wir liegen allzu weit zur ck und pushen kr ftig um gute fortschritte zu machen und vorne dabei bleiben zu k nnen
3009195 ich bin nicht entschlossener als an jedem anderen ort auch den gleichen job muss ich doch insgesamt elf mal in einem jahr abliefern
3009196 ich bin ein gro er anh nger des gedankens jedes rennen mit derselben einstellung anzugehen hoffentlich sind wir schnell und k nnen eine gute show bieten und nat rlich so viele punkte mitnehmen wie nur irgend m glich ich f hle mich zuversichtlich aber man kann nur schwer vorhersagen was alles passieren wird
3009197 vieles h ngt einfach davon ab wer zwischen den rennen die besten entwicklungen bringen kann bevor man zur strecke f hrt wenn du vor ort bist dann k nnen verschiedene umst nde beeinflussen was sich alles ereignet
3009198 mein ziel ist noch immer die formel 1 die dtm macht aber auch viel spa das ist wirklich eine gro artige meisterschaft mein definitives ziel bleibt allerdings die formel 1 und ich hoffe sehr dass ich dort eines tages auch eine chance bekomme ich konzentriere mich erst einmal auf dieses jahr dann werden wir weitersehen
3009199 what the hell kind of use is a canon tower going to do there
3009200 from being something amazing to something we dont even recognize
3009201 mi gober precioso t eres el h roe de esta pel cula pap
3009202 se coart uno de los principales derechos de los trabajadores que es la b squeda de mejores condiciones de trabajo y de vida
3009203 y los empleados fueron perseguidos por la gente de nacif a partir de que fueron a la junta local se les amenaz y hostig hasta que fueron despedidos cuando se viola el derecho de organizaci n no se puede aspirar a que en la maquila existan mejores condiciones de trabajo
3009204 en ese entonces las de levis y de pony ya estaban all
3009205 siempre aceptaban dinero o material del que se trabajaba y como a los cinco a os de trabajar ah me enter de que los inspectores ten an una bodega
3009206 o sea que a donde quiera que iban con eso les pagaban y ellos se llevaban el material a un almac n que era como una tienda hab a de todo era una sinverg enzada porque hasta donde yo recuerdo nunca se pusieron a ver qu era lo que estaba mal o a decir que algo ten a que cambiar
3009207 a los trabajadores que intentaron organizarse a quienes lucharon por defender su derecho a la libertad de asociaci n les ha sido dif cil integrarse a un nuevo trabajo porque debido a las listas negras los otros patronos no los contratan
3009208 normalmente nos piden que intervengamos con las empresas propietarias de las marcas
3009209 pero en este caso adem s de que las marcas levis y limited est n en california la sede de tarrant est aqu
3009210 la primera es que logramos que dos marcas muy importantes levis y limited reaccionaran y mandaran inspectores independientes para verificar si era cierto lo que estaban diciendo los trabajadores
3009211 y el otro logro es la queja ante el tlc que fue hist rica
3009212 fue el primer caso de una maquila de ropa presentado en conjunto por personas y activistas laborales en m xico estados unidos y canad
3009213 pero al menos hemos tra do el tema a la luz no podemos dejar de insistir en que las compa as no pueden ir al rinc n m s oscuro del mundo donde nadie los va a ver y donde nadie puede reaccionar simplemente para poder producir m s y m s barato
3009214 es algo bueno porque es la evidencia de algo que los trabajadores ya sab an que el gobierno muchas veces est vendido y que los empresarios lo tienen a su disposici n
3009215 los hombres como kamel nacif tienen tanto poder para hacer lo que quieren que pueden coartar la libertad de expresi n como en el caso de lydia cacho o mandar encarcelar a la gente
3009216 nacif arrastra muchas denuncias desde los a os 90 y nadie le ha hecho nada acabo de leer que va a retirar su producci n y se va a largar pero es uno de los principales responsables del desempleo uno de los principales violadores de los derechos laborales y del estado de derecho qui n le sigue los pasos qu va a pasar con l
3009217 no podemos seguir permitiendo que se vayan a otros pa ses y sean intocables
3009218 i dont really have any idea what happened they just forced me to leave
3009219 i said i didnt do anything to the man his accuser so how can they pardon me
3009220 whats obvious is that the government took license that it shouldnt have to go after rights activists in mexico and underestimated the power of the people
3009221 this was a new program designed to get at the underground economy
3009222 if you cant find overtime and minimum wage violations in the underground economy have you even found the underground economy
3009223 whats not good for california is when businesses build their success by cheating not paying taxes or workers comp or exploiting workers
3009224 employ vulnerable workers newly arrived immigrants children and the poor to whom they often fail to pay even the minimum wage mandated by state or federal law
3009225 even if all 50 wage audits theyre still doing are all overtime and minimum wage violations theyd still only have little more than 100 citations
3009226 we dont see any real sign of focus on getting back wages for employees
3009227 i think theyre going in and checking the low hanging fruit like a lack of workers compensation thats good but its not enough we think more than half the garment workers are underpaid
3009228 the pressure of globalization to keep businesses here rather than them going to other countries provides more incentive to cheat workers
3009229 one person will go off and find the employer when we go into a business the other inspectors are talking to employees
3009230 i made copies of each check so i had proof what i had been paid
3009231 i was not able to interview any employees because they are supposedly all monolingual spanish speakers and i did not have an interpreter available
3009232 it is heartbreaking that year after year women and men are killed while making clothes for stores in our communities
3009233 the events of the last few days are a glaring indictment of the continued failure of industry both locally and internationally to ensure workplace safety we call upon all those connected to these facilities to come forward and take reponsibility for making sure that this senseless loss of life comes to an end
3009234 inspecting factories only makes a difference when workers and their organisations are involved otherwise auditors remain blind to the reality that workers face and are unable to draw up plans to follow up and fix the problems in a way thats sustainable in the long term and can make a meaningful improvments
3009235 while some buyers have begun to take steps to systematically address conditions at their supply units the vast majority have yet to really take sufficient concrete action to improve the dreadful situation in the workplaces where their products are made
3009236 for people who have scoffed at the viability of sweat free producers the growth of this list is proving them wrong in fact the guide is one of the most popular pages on our website this year consumers can build the momentum of the anti sweatshop movement while shopping for the holidays
3009237 we must remember that the places listed on this sweat free guide came out of the brave resistance of workers demanding to be treated with dignity and respect
3009238 every sweat free purchase helps workers maintain the good wages and working conditions they have achieved through hard work and long struggle
3009239 co ops are necessary here in the u s because we are losing so many jobs
3009240 major retailers dont care how the clothes are made or who gets hurt
3009241 here it is very different oh yes here they dont pressure us so much they pay our benefits they dont insult us were making constant progress
3009242 these sweat free companies operate in a completely different way than large multinational retailers in an industry characterized by flagrant abuses including substandard wages extremely long working hours with no overtime pay locked bathrooms factory closure without notice and employer abuse buying from a sweat free retailer is another way for consumers to say no to sweatshop exploitation
3009243 es dif cil saber cu ntos trabajadores se encuentran en esa situaci n debido a la ilegalidad de f bricas y trabajadores
3009244 se han realizado estudios que demuestran que el 99 de estos talleres presenta alguna violaci n a la ley y que el 70 no paga el salario m nimo
3009245 la excepci n es encontrar una f brica que cumpla con las leyes laborales
3009246 cuando llegu vi que este era el trabajo m s com n tuve que ir a la escuela de costura para aprender a manejar la m quina yo me la pagu como pude pero ya despu s me llev una gran desilusi n
3009247 es una explotaci n no garantizan el salario m nimo porque le pagan a uno por pieza si uno hace 200 d lares en 50 horas porque el trabajo est muy complicado eso es lo que le pagan a uno es una frustraci n un coraje que tengo porque por lo que veo la justicia no hace nada la oficina del comisionado laboral no hace nada solamente llega supuestamente a inspeccionar pone sus multas miles de d lares que agarran y nunca vuelven nunca cambian las condiciones a uno al contrario porque cuando se van a uno le bajan los precios de las piezas para recuperar la multa que les pusieron
3009248 si ellos mismos est n ilegales buscan que los trabajadores sean indocumentados porque est n con m s miedo y es m s f cil explotarlos nosotros calculamos que el salario promedio que reciben estos trabajadores es de 3 20 d lares por hora la mitad del salario m nimo
3009249 pero de 95 para ac entr el tratado de libre comercio tlc con m xico y canad
3009250 hay piezas de 25 50 centavos porque uno se tarda mucho en cerrarlas pero hay otras de hasta dos centavos
3009251 por ejemplo esta semana voy a cobrar 310 d lares tengo trabajados cinco d as trabajando como 9 9 y media horas
3009252 m s la comida el transporte la luz el gas los otros gastos que uno tiene
3009253 los empleadores se aprovechan de que mucha gente viene por la situaci n econ mica de nuestros pa ses y ellos saben que hay mucha gente esperando as que si no te parece enseguida viene otro y lo hace por menos
3009254 los compa eros no agarran la onda de que nos est n explotando porque comparado con lo que se gana en los pa ses de uno ellos sienten que est n ganando bien
3009255 ellos s lo quieren trabajar bien duro pero es matarse mucho por ese dinero
3009256 all es un sueldo fijo pero a veces no ganas ni el m nimo aqu estamos en lugares donde nos estamos ahogando porque no hay un ventilador pero all tampoco si aqu est sucio all es lo mismo
3009257 me dijeron lo que me iban a pagar y no me conven a
3009258 no hay duda de que la gente se sacrifica para tener unos centavitos m s para mandarlos a su pa s o poder sacar adelante a sus hijos aqu a veces a costa de su propia salud
3009259 cerrar la brecha de desarrollo entre el sur de nuestro pa s y el norte del mismo
3009260 una cosa que es muy triste y lo vemos no s lo en el caso de las maquiladoras de nacif sino en todo m xico es que cuando hay trabajadores que se atreven a luchar a no dejarse no solamente son despedidos sino que los ponen en listas negras entonces es muy dif cil que consigan otro empleo
3009261 y no hay fuentes de trabajo por eso est n en la maquila que los est medio matando y mal pagando obviamente si pudieran escoger otra cosa muchos lo har an pero cuando no pueden trabajar en la maquila muchos buscan su soluci n unos se meten en la econom a informal a vender cosas en la calle y hay otros que emigran
3009262 de las personas que me han platicado en m xico est n ganando 800 pesos por semana menos de 80 d lares y eso que ganan m s del salario m nimo
3009263 yo escucho que el abuso all tambi n es bien grande
3009264 pero yo pienso ok aqu porque llegamos como migrantes no es nuestro pa s no conocemos el idioma son otras leyes la mayor a no tenemos un estatus migratorio legal esas son muchas de las cosas que nos detienen a quedarnos ah pero y all all es nuestro pa s en este caso qui nes son los extranjeros entonces por qu me voy a dejar
3009265 i hear you work at a night club here in town
3009266 todays data centers and commercial buildings have unique infrastructure needs and require a wide range of equipment and applications to support them
3009267 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3009268 die plazenta wird im obstgarten vergraben und uns wundervolle fr chte bringen

3009270 coming up in the next few weeks we are getting closer to being able to propose something that will ensure the viability of the mill
3009271 at the grand falls mill we need to continue to work on our comprehensive plan to make sure we can make it more productive and effective
3009272 when we have a plan for the grand falls mill you will see it is going to be a bold one but it will be necessary to make sure it can survive
3009273 in the next few weeks we should come to a conclusion
3009274 it has been longer than we initially thought but again it is complex and we are trying to make the best business decisions to get through it
3009275 the unions in the past have given concessions and there is some question why we have to do that but it is a question of observing how the industry and markets are behaving
3009276 we have no choice but to continue our approach and reduce our costs
3009277 i was very interested in just how the immune system worked
3009278 i really thought that with cancer having touched my family so maliciously throughout my life this is the key component in the battle against cancer i was really interested in doing work in an area that would allow me to contribute to the fight against cancer
3009279 there wasnt one particular point why i decided to do medicine but it was definitely while i was in grad school that i realized that pure research wasnt what i wanted to do with my life
3009280 tony is an exceptional emergencitologist and it really laid the groundwork for me on the bread and butter of family physician life
3009281 i thoroughly enjoy getting up in the morning and going to the hospital
3009282 its not work for me i get up and i go i thrive on it
3009283 i think the crew has embraced me more than i would have ever expected or anticipated
3009284 they really are there to help they are a residents best source of information and help
3009285 i think having a family physician available to deliver non complicated pregnancies is a fantastic relief for the obstetrician gynaecologist that would leave that person and here its dr steve parsons able to do what he is trained to do which is the more complicated serious problems the more urgent needs complicated twin pregnancies things that require his special expertise and special abilities
3009286 dr parsons is an absolutely fantastic obstetrician not only that he is a first rate individual who has the best interest of not only his institution and his community but in individual people at heart here is a guy on the front lines who sees a problem and is speaking out about something that needs correction i think if a guy who is in that position is asking for help then he should get some help
3009287 it is an epidemic here in central in all areas i believe
3009288 parts of the hospital are closed because we do not have the ability to keep them open and staff them properly for patient care
3009289 its not a greedy thing money does play in to it but it plays into patient safety and what they need best thats my opinion im not in on that side i dont know the administrative side but its from what i see
3009290 i think that we could be doing a more effective job at recruitment in all areas
3009291 start recruiting younger let them see this is the place whereby you will be able to learn throughout your education at the hands on level
3009292 when are we all going to do something about this
3009293 ten years ago it vandalism was a forgotten art and you never saw much litter around town but now it is terrible
3009294 it seems no one is taking the lead to rectify it i do not think it is fair to lay the responsibility to stop it on one group lets all collectively do something someone has to do something about it
3009295 it is a different generation i go to the ball field and the dug out is beat up the wires are torn down we are picking up glass before every game theres the smell of urine in the corner where they go to the bathroom
3009296 what can we do to fix the problem because it is a significant problem no doubt you cannot point the finger at one person to say it is your responsibility to fix it it is all our responsibility but who is going to take the lead
3009297 we have no leads right now although we did stop and talk to a number of people on the trail that night
3009298 not pointing the finger at any young people or anything but we did stop and talk to several young people there that night one of the young people was drunk so we took that person home to their parents
3009299 it is a beautiful trail there and this is terrible

3009306 we are feeling the effects of a slowing global economy on our business this has resulted in lower than anticipated sales of our 3gpp and wifi based network products and a delay in wimax network deployments that will continue to impact projected sales of our wimax semiconductor products
3009307 a softening in the overall demand for wimax products based on the current 802 16d standards as operators consider whether or not to wait for the next generation of mobile wimax technologies
3009308 some prospective and existing customers have delayed their rollouts and purchasing decisions as they review the option of adopting a next generation mobile wimax solution we believe that market opportunities remain strong due to the demand for broadband access but the timing of customer decisions has become more difficult to predict
3009309 current customers are expanding their networks bookings are strong and the pipeline of potential new business is large and growing this further increases our confidence in our ability to achieve the upper end of our target revenue range of 275 to 300 million for 2008
3009310 the business outlook in the second half looks improved from the recent past as more operators utilize fixed wimax and mobile wimax increases in momentum given the current market perspectives we anticipate that our full year revenue will be in the range of 90 million and wimax will continue to increase as a percentage of our customer wins and revenues
3009311 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3009312 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth
3009313 it confirms that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3009314 many of these bacteria have not been described because they are quite hard to grow in the lab and when you go further down into the digestive system it gets even harder to do this
3009315 these bacteria are thought to have an involvement in dental caries and other mouth problems so describing them gives you a broader picture of the causation of these

3009336 given the importance of firefighters in protecting our communities i am extremely disappointed that i am once again having to condemn further attacks on them
3009337 our firefighters put their lives on the line every day to save lives in their communities by attacking them these people are attacking the whole community their actions are cowardly and totally unacceptable
3009338 there is a very real risk that if these attacks continue a firefighter will be seriously injured or equipment may be damaged resulting in a fire engine not being available for a real emergency
3009339 i would ask the perpetrators of this violence to think of these very serious consequences before engaging in this dangerous criminal and anti social behaviour

3009416 een achterstallige factuur is voor een burger of een bedrijf even belangrijk en vaak zelfs belangrijker dan voor de overheid ze kan leiden tot betalingsmoeilijkheden persoonlijke dramas en zelfs faillissementen allemaal problemen waar de overheid niet mee geconfronteerd kan worden
3009417 uit onderzoek van graydon blijkt dat slechte betalers volgens curatoren de hoofdoorzaak zijn bij een op de tien faillissementen ook 12 procent van de handelsrechters zien wanbetalers als hoofdoorzaak van falingen
3009418 het is jammer dat sommige van onze partners ons niet helpen en zelfs proberen ons te hinderen ik heb het in het bijzonder over de verplaatsing door de vs van het georgisch militair contingent uit irak naar de conflictzone
3009419 dit manoeuvre zal niets veranderen het is een stap terug van een oplossing voor de situatie
3009420 wat in zuid osseti gebeurt is een ware tragedie een menselijke tragedie
3009421 de agressor in het conflict voor te stellen als het slachtoffer
3009422 niet het cynisme van dit beleid verrassend is want politiek is op zich een cynische zaak wel verrassend is de omvang van het cynisme de vakkundigheid om wit zwart te laten lijken en vice versa de vakkundigheid om agressors als slachtoffers voor te stellen en de verantwoordelijkheid voor de gevolgen te leggen bij de slachtoffers
3009423 saddam hoessein die meerder sjiitische dorpen uitmoordde is uiteindelijk voor zoiets opgehangen
3009424 maar voor georgische politici die sommige ossetische steden van de kaart veegden wier tanks over vrouwen en kinderen reden die mensen levend verbranddden in hun huizen voor dergelijk soort politici wordt om een vreemde reden gedacht dat die bescherming nodig hebben

3009446 this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood
3009447 behold the days are coming declares the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and the house of judah 32 not like the covenant that i made with their fathers on the day when i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt my covenant that they broke though i was their husband declares the lord 33 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days declares the lord i will put my law within them and i will write it on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people 34 and no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest declares the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more

3009452 die dauernde konfrontation mit dem gerede um liebe die berflutung mit erotischen und sexuellen reizen und das perpetuale fortw hrende anm d red vorgehalten bekommen wie toll das alles sein soll gibt mir ein immer st rkeres gef hl nicht zu euch anderen zu geh ren pervers oder geisteskrank zu sein
3009453 es ist dennoch gut zu wissen dass die schwierigkeiten offenbar doch nicht ganz so speziell sind ich entdecke viele hnliche z ge bei einigen von euch
3009454 ja auch ich geh re zu den sogenannten abs ich bin 26 m nnlich habe durchaus viele frauen in meinem freundes und bekanntenkreis und trotzdem bin ich jungfrau bei mir pers nlich ist es das problem dass ich mir st ndig viel zu viele gedanken dar ber mache wie ich auf andere wirke das blockiert mich f hrt zu selbstzweifeln und vor allem ist es ein teufelskreis
3009455 klingt sinnvoll ist es aber nicht denn selbst wenn versagens ngste eine rolle spielen was definitiv nur bei einem bruchteil der jungfrauen der fall ist ist es doch nunmal so wie minderwertig muss ich mich als ab wohl f hlen wenn die einzige m glichkeit sexuelle erfahrungen zu sammeln darin besteht f r sex zu bezahlen
3009456 ich denke nicht dass das problem der abs ist noch nie mit jemandem sex gehabt zu haben sondern dass sie berhaupt noch nie die erfahrung gemacht haben wie es ist geliebt zu werden denn wenn man das erst einmal sp rt dann wird sex ganz schnell zur nebensache wenn auch zu der vielleicht sch nsten auf der welt
3009457 ich bin 23 und habe seit einem halben jahr meine erste freundin und hatte vor drei monaten auch erst zum 1
3009458 man ist zwar oft abgelenkt durch beruf und andere dinge aber in manchen momenten macht einen die liebesbezogen einsamkeit einfach fast kaputt was nat rlich dann zum problem werden kann ist dass man dieses gef hl auch bekommt wenn man auf eine frau zugehen will
3009459 sich hier hinzsutellen und zu sagen die stellen sich dann einfach nur doof an ist ja wohl sehr beschr nkt ich kenne mehrere leute einschlie lich mir selbst die ihren ersten partner erst weit nach ihrem 20 geburtstag hatten und als ob die einsamkeit die man schon selbst in sich sp rt nicht schon schlimm genug ist kommen dann so fr hpubert re besserwisser und behaupten man solle hal tmal von der glotze weg also wenn beziehungen so einfach w ren
3009460 ich wei nicht aber ich denke irgendwann kommt man aus bestimmten verhaltensmustern nicht mehr raus und dann hilft es vielleicht sich professionelle hilfe zu suchen wenn man so sehr darunter leidet daf r braucht man sich nicht sch men oder minderwertig zu f hlen
3009461 ich wei aus eigener erfahrung dass eine gute psychotherapie hilft bin zwar mit 26 immer noch ab aber mein welt und selbstbild hat sich durch eine therapie absolut grundlegend ver ndert und zwar sehr zum positiven auch m nnerm ig bin ich auf dem richtigen weg ich finde auch absolut nix dabei eine therapie zu machen das hei t nicht dass man einen an der waffel hat sondern dass man seine probleme erkennt und aktiv angeht zum arzt geht man auch nicht erst mit einer lungenentz ndung sondern schon mit einer grippe

3009483 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3009484 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3009485 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3009486 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3009487 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight

3009543 i dont get any trouble as such but its not the best there are good things a lot of families live here
3009544 but there is nothing for youngsters to do there is nothing in the hexham road park

3009561 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger

3009580 the response includes information on the national cyber security center how privacy will be protected under the cnci how success of the initiative will be measured and how the department views the private sectors role in the initiative
3009581 the department chose to redact information relating to contracting at the national cyber security division the senators have asked dhs explain their reasons for the redactions
3009582 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
3009583 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
3009584 prior to this announcement committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the ncsc was itself classified
3009585 their letter to dhs in may asked for a detailed account of the departments role in the comprehensive national cyber security initiative noting a lack of information from the department in spite of the fact that the administration had claimed that cybersecurity was one of chertoffs top four priorities for 08
3009586 rod beckstrom the director of the national cyber security center in dhs continued the pattern of providing few details during his keynote at the black hat security conference thursday in las vegas
3009587 instead of getting into specifics both examples of real threats and what the government is trying to do about it he mainly talked in general terms about how businesses need to understand better the economics of security and the need to improve collaboration between people and governments throughout the world he also talked at length about abraham lincoln and george washington and how those two would have approached tech security
3009588 beckstrom started in march so hes still pretty new plus this administration has gone through cyber chiefs like spinal tap goes through drummers
3009589 so we should cut him a little slack still we couldnt help but feel disappointed by what we consider another missed opportunity
3009590 its completely surreal and we are really uneasy we dont dare any more to propose any price below 100 million for these clients anything below and they throw you out and you should see how they do it

3009594 we have said that this is a condition driven process

3009596 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
3009597 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
3009598 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
3009599 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
3009600 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
3009601 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
3009602 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3009603 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3009604 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3009605 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3009606 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
3009607 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
3009608 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
3009609 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3009610 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3009611 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
3009612 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3009613 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

3009762 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3009763 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3009764 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3009765 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3009766 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3009767 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3009768 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3009769 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3009774 bukankah engkau hanya seorang manusia biasa seperti kami dan tidak berbeda dari kami jikalau betul alloh akan mengutuskan seorang rasul yang membawa perintah nya nescaya dia akan mengutuskan seorang malaikat yang patut kami dengarkan kata katanya dan kami ikuti ajakannya dan bukan manusia biasa seperti engkau yang hanya dapat diikuti orang orang rendah kedudukan sosialnya seperti para buruh petani orang orang yang tidak berpenghasilan yang bagi kami mereka seperti sampah masyarakat pengikut pengikutmu itu adalah orang orang yang tidak mempunyai daya fikiran dan ketajaman otak mereka mengikutimu secara buta tuli tanpa memikirkan dan menimbangkan masak masak benar atau tidaknya dakwah dan ajakanmu itu coba jika agama yang engkau bawa dan ajaran ajaran yang engkau sodorkan kepada kami itu benar niscaya kamilah yang lebih dulu mengikutimu dan bukannya orang orang yang mengemis seperti pengikut pengikutmu itu kami sebagai pemuka pemuka masyarakat yang pandai berfikir memiliki kecerdasan otak dan pandangan yang luas dan yang dipandang masyarakat sebagai pemimpin pemimpinnya tidaklah mudah kami menerima ajakanmu dan dakwahmu engkau tidak mempunyai kelebihan di atas kami tentang soal soal kemasyarakatan dan pergaulan hidup kami jauh lebih pandai dan lebih mengetahui daripadamu tentang hal itu semuanya anggapan kami terhadapmu tidak lain dan tidak bukan bahwa engkau adalah pendusta belaka
3009775 adakah engkau mengira bahwa aku dapat memaksa kamu mengikuti ajaranku atau mengira bahwa aku mempunyai kekuasaan untuk menjadikan kamu orang orang yang beriman jika kamu tetap menolak ajakanku dan tetap buta serta tuli terhadap bukti bukti kebenaran dakwahku dan tetap mempertahakan pendirianmu yang tersesat yang diilhamkan oleh kesombongan dan kecongkakan karena kedudukan dan harta benda yang kamu miliki aku hanya seorang manusia yang mendapat amanat dan diberi tugas oleh alloh untuk menyampaikan risalah nya kepada kamu jika kamu tetap berkeras kepala dan tidak mauu kembali ke jalan yang benar dan menerima agama alloh yang diutuskan nya kepadaku maka terserahlah kepada alloh untuk menentukan hukuman nya dan gajaran nya keatas diri kamu aku hanya pesuruh dan rasul nya yang diperintahkan untuk menyampaikan amanat nya kepada hamba hamba nya dialah yang berkuasa memberi hidayah kepadamu dan mengampuni dosamu atau menurunkan adzab dan siksaan nya di atas kamu sekalian jika dia menghendaki dialah pula yang berkuasa menurunkan siksa dan adzab nya di dunia atau menangguhkannya sampai hari kemudian dialah tuhan pencipta alam semesta ini maha kuasa maha mengetahui maha pengasih dan maha penyayang
3009776 wahai nuh jika engkau menghendaki kami mengikutimu dan memberi sokongan dan semangat kepada kamu dan kepada agama yang engkau bawa maka jauhkanlah para pengikutmu yang terdiri dari orang orang petani buruh dan hamba hamba sahaya itu usirlah mereka dari pengaulanmu karena kami tidak dapat bergaul dengan mereka duduk berdampingan dengan mereka mengikut cara hidup mereka dan bergabung dengan mereka dalam satu agama dan kepercayaan dan bagaimana kami dapat menerima satu agama yang menyamaratakan para bangsawan dengan orang awam penguasa dan pembesar dengan buruh buruhnya dan orang kaya yang berkedudukan dengan orang yang miskin dan papa
3009777 risalah dan agama yang aku bawa adalah untuk semua orang tiada pengecualian yang pandai maupun yang bodoh yang kaya maupun miskin majikan ataupun buruh atau antara peguasa dan rakyat biasa semuanya mempunyai kedudukan dan tempat yang sama di dalam agama dan hukum alloh andai aku memenuhi persyaratan kamu dan meluluskan keinginanmu menyingkirkan para pengikutku yang setia itu maka siapakah yang dapat kuharapkan akan meneruskan dakwahku kepada orang ramai dan bagaimana aku sampai hati menjauhkan dariku orang orang yang telah beriman dan menerima dakwahku dengan penuh keyakinan dan keikhlasan dikala kamu menolaknya serta mengingkarinya orang orang yang telah membantuku dalam tugasku dikala kamu menghalangi usahaku dan merintangi dakwahku dan bagaimanakah aku dapat mempertanggungjawabkan tindakan pengusiranku kepada mereka terhadap alloh bila mereka mengadu bahwa aku telah membalas kesetiaan dan ketaatan mereka dengan keburukan hanya karena semata mata untuk memenuhi permintaanmu dan tunduk kepada pensyaratanmu yang tidak wajar dan tidak dapat diterima oleh akal dan fikiran yang sehat sesungguhnya kamu adalah orang orang yang bodoh dan tidak berfikiran sehat
3009778 wahai nuh kita telah banyak bermujadalah dan berdebat dan cukup berdialog serta mendengar dakwahmu yang sudah menjemukan itu kami tetap tidak akan mengikutimu dan tidak akan sekali kali melepaskan kepercayaan dan adat istiadat kami sehingga tidak ada gunanya lagi engkau mengulang ulangi dakwah dan ajakanmu dan bertegang lidah dengan kami sekarang datangkanlah siksaan alloh yang engkau ancamkan kepada kami jika kamu adalah orang yang benar kami ingin melihat kebenaran kata katamu dan ancamanmu dalam kenyataan karena kami masih tetap belum mempercayaimu dan tetap meragukan dakwahmu
3009779 sesungguhnya tidak akan ada seorang daripada kaummu yang mau mengikutimu dan beriman kecuali mereka yang telah mengikutimu dan beriman lebih dahulu maka janganlah engkau bersedih hati terhadap apa yang mereka katakan
3009780 ya alloh janganlah engkau biarkan seorang pun orang orang kafir itu hidup dan tinggal di atas bumi ini mereka akan berusaha menyesatkan hamba hamba mu jika engkau biarkan mereka tinggal dan mereka tidak akan melahirkan dan menurunkan selain anak anak yang berbuat maksiat dan anak anak yang kafir seperti mereka
3009781 wahai nuh sejak kapan engkau telah menjadi tukang kayu dan pembuat kapal bukankah engkau mengaku sebagai seorang nabi dan rasul kenapa sekarang menjadi seorang tukang kayu dan pembuat kapal dan engkau membuat kapal itu di tempat yang jauh dari air apa engkau akan menggunakan kerbau untuk menariknya ke pantai ataukah mengharapkan angin yang akan mendorongnya ke laut
3009782 baiklah tunggu saja saatnya nanti jika kamu sekarang mengejek dan mengolok olok kami maka akan tibalah masanya kelak bagi kami untuk mengejek kamu dan akan kamu ketahui kelak untuk apa kapal yang kami siapkan ini tunggulah saatnya adzab dan hukuman alloh menimpa atas diri kamu
3009783 siap siaplah engkau dengan kapalmu bila tiba perintah ku dan terlihat tanda tanda dari ku maka segeralah angkut bersamamu di dalam kapalmu dan kerabatmu dan bawalah dua pasang dari setiap jenis makhluk yang ada di atas bumi dan berlayarlah dengan izin ku

3009787 ya tuhanku sesungguhnya puteraku itu adalah darah dagingku dan adalah bahagian dari keluargaku dan sesungguhnya janji mu adalah janji benar dan engkaulah maha hakim yang maha berkuasa
3009788 wahai nuh sesungguhnya dia puteramu itu tidaklah termasuk keluargamu karena ia telah menyimpang dari ajaranmu melanggar perintahmu menolak dakwahmu dan mengikuti jejak orang orang yang kafir coretlah namanya dari daftar keluargamu hanya mereka yang telah menerima dakwahmu mengikuti jalanmu dan beriman kepada ku sajalah dapat engkau masukkan ke dalam barisan keluargamu yang telah aku janjikan perlindungannya dan terjamin keselamatan jiwanya adapun orang orang yang mengingkari risalah ku mendustakan dakwahmu dan telah mengikuti hawa nafsunya dan tuntutan iblis pastilah mereka akan binasa menjalani hukuman yang telah aku tentukan walau mereka berada dipuncak gunung maka janganlah engkau sesekali menanyakan tentang sesuatu yang engkau belum ketahui aku ingatkan janganlah engkau sampai tergolong ke dalam golongan orang orang yang bodoh
3009789 ya tuhanku aku berlindung kepada mu dari godaan syaitan yang terlaknat ampunilah kelalaian dan kealpaanku sehingga aku menanyakan sesuatu yang aku tidak mengetahuinya ya tuhanku bila engkau tidak memberi ampun dan maghfiroh serta menurunkan rahmat bagiku niscaya aku menjadi orang yang rugi

3009814 therein will they recline at ease therein can they call for fruit in abundance and delicious drink and beside them will be chaste women restraining their glances companions of equal age
3009815 we have not heard of this from the religion of these later days meaning christianity if this quran were true the christians would have told us about it
3009816 allah says that the actual reason with those people for their denial is not any defect in the message of islam but their own arrogance jealousy and insistence on following the blind
3009817 in discussing this passage the scholars of tafsir quran commentary mention a story which is mostly based upon israiliyat israelite narrations nothing has been reported about this from the infallible prophet that we could accept as true
3009818 and david thought in other words he became certain that we had indeed tried him that we had caused him to fall into a trial that is a test through his love for that woman so he sought forgiveness of his lord and fell down bowing in other words prostrate and repented

3009826 the question is is this just a little blip in a long historical trend or is there something going on here that we need to be concerned about

3009832 the south florida bulls are no longer a surprise team and george selvie could be a perfect example of why the defensive end made a statement last season by posting eye popping numbers that would make opposing offensive coordinators cringe
3009833 two years ago usfs fan appreciation day drew little more than a few hundred fans to the practice fields on campus for a chance to watch a half hour of practice and get autographs from coach jim leavitt and the players
3009834 the most extraordinary thing about the story is the vision of the pioneers
3009835 the pioneers had the right idea get the land and adapt as you go
3009836 over time the use of park lands changed quite significantly with an uneasy balance between passive and active recreation to cleveland there didnt seem to be a need for places for people to exercise not when they worked 10 or more hours a day six days a week
3009837 what they needed was a place to relax the emersonian notion about the benefits of nature games didnt have a role until the late 1890s and the first playgrounds were built in 1906 but one of the lessons of park history is that people use the land as they want to there have always been contentions about how parks should be used but its nice to fight over land we own
3009838 nearly ever foot of land that borders water is owned by the park board
3009839 getting lake calhoun seemed like the smart thing to do and when people saw improvements to the lakes they wanted the park system to include others such as hiawatha and nokomis after the city expanded south
3009840 wirth wanted to alter lake harriet too by building a peninsula into it
3009841 city councils and mayors have so many demands on them and so many improvements to consider that they invariably react by dealing with the most immediate need
3009842 parks are never the most immediate need without long term vision we wouldnt have the parks we have
3009843 ice has authority to arrest anyone in violation of u s immigration laws anywhere in the country having said that we understand that there are particular sensitivities surrounding locations such as churches and schools like all law enforcement agencies ice prioritizes enforcement efforts and we make arrests at the appropriate time and place
3009844 criminalize providing humanitarian aid to persons without first checking their legal status
3009845 usually all we know is that someone is here but we dont know what brought them here we need to pay more attention to their stories
3009846 we need to be mindful in terms of taking care of all people including those residents who arent citizens
3009847 a lot of our work is about connecting anglo catholics building solidarity

3009850 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her
3009851 she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3009852 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3009853 however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3009854 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
3009855 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3009856 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3009857 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3009858 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3009859 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is
3009860 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
3009861 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
3009862 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material
3009863 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
3009864 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being
3009865 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3009866 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place
3009867 he was a genuinely funny and nice guy i say this because prior to working with him on the show i had no knowledge of who he was and how well known of a comedian he was but unlike a lot of people at his level he was very friendly down to earth and accommodating when our paths accidentally crossed about a week later at lax airport he greeted me as if i had been a life long friend and i could feel the genuine warmth and sincerity of that greeting may god have mercy on his soul
3009868 bernie mac will be remembered i met him on the set of
3009869 bernie mac had the ability to effortlessly make people laugh he was an incredible talent with whom my colleagues and i in aafca always looked forward to covering bernie had a big heart and he will certainly be missed by the members of our organization

3009871 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook
3009872 enterprises need to have a presence on the web and they want to be relevant
3009873 but stories like this signal the need for sites like facebook and myspace to filter and be more proactive
3009874 this happens every time some cool new technology comes along that attracts a lot of users
3009875 technologies like vmwares vdi virtual desktop infrastructure need a huge amount of hardware like servers storage and
3009876 when we are talking about call centers trading floors and setups where there are large numbers of people and plenty of bandwidth this type of technology can be ideal
3009877 intel and amd have changed the x86 architecture with these technologies by adding four new levels of privilege this is by far the most significant change in the x86 architecture to have taken place in the last quarter century
3009878 virtualization helps resolve the issue that pcs are too complicated
3009879 on the desktop virtualization is the masking of physical resources what it does is decouple the hardware the os and the applications by interposing a thin layer of software any level can be changed without having an effect on any other
3009880 for example it can be valuable if you are moving oses perhaps to vista normally you have to do regression testing to make sure all your combinations of apps work together but you can remove the links between all your apps altogether by virtualizing them and we are seeing a lot of interest in that right now
3009881 do i have to leave the application bubble on the desktop or could i not store it in the data center
3009882 youve got to learn to live with what you cant rise above
3009883 its a fantastic game for me and for our supporters as carlisle are a very good side
3009884 i was delighted when the draw came out its been some time since i left so i hope any ill feeling has passed and we can watch a great game
3009885 cup runs are good for the team and good for the club
3009886 you want to win every game you play in and the fact that its against my old club is neither here nor there i just want to get through
3009887 expectations are high but weve got to deal with that
3009888 you have the incredibly hands on french government dramatically capping bills and the british government fiddling around the edges
3009889 it is testament to the hard work of everyone in involved that we have been able to confirm an alternative venue for the mountain biking competition only seven months after the venue change was announced
3009890 in hadleigh farm we have a world class venue for the games with the potential for an excellent facility for elite and community use post games
3009891 i am absolutely delighted hadleigh farm is the chosen venue for the mountain biking event of the london 2012 games
3009892 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase hadleigh and essex to the world to provide a real legacy both for local people and the international mountain bike community and show everyone all essex can offer for sport business tourism and sustainable regeneration
3009893 we had 978 people take part which is about 220 more than last year
3009894 it was a tremendous day and the sun shined i think the event is just fun for people because it costs them a couple of quid to get everything that they need and to see the youngsters faces when they pull out their first crab is just magical
3009895 as well as getting people of many ages and it being a fun day out it generates a lot for the local economy
3009896 people visit the cafes and shops and bring in a considerable amount of money and that is why it is important to protect the sea defences so that the event can come back for generation after generation

3009900 had it not been for the original vision of tom rodgers 35 years ago none of this would be here today we honor a man who helped write one of the greatest chapters in conservation history
3009901 the nwtfs museum is one of the finest museums in the state and the programs conducted not only on site but through the federations outreach efforts are of the highest quality
3009902 theres no question that the entire state benefits economically socially and environmentally from the nwtf
3009903 toms influence on the conservation industry on wildlife and hunters rights is immeasurable
3009904 without him the nwtf wouldnt exist and wild turkeys literally would not be where they are today i am honored to recognize the man who created the nwtf which is now one of the most dynamic and respected conservation organizations in north america
3009905 tom hired me as the federations director of research in 1980
3009906 working alongside tom in those early years and sharing his vision of a positive future for conservation and hunting for nearly three decades as part of the nwtf team has been a privilege
3009907 my dream was to give the wild turkey a promising future and i knew that trapping and transferring wild turkeys was the way to accomplish that mission
3009908 now the federation has become an organization that not only restores north americas grandest gamebird and their habitat but also brings new hunters into the fold and fights to protect our hunting heritage i couldnt be more proud
3009909 through its families afield program the nwtf works with sportsmen elected officials and wildlife agency personnel to lift restrictions and allow young people and first time hunters to try hunting with an adult mentor
3009910 it is also imperative that we support the next generation of hunters by making sure they have places to hunt the nwtfs new more places to hunt program partners nwtf volunteers with landowners and state and federal agencies to help improve hunter access through land purchases conservation easements and legislative action

3009917 we want them to feel that theyre being judged on their smarts and their competitiveness and their compassion and not just you know looking cute
3009918 well she seems like a good person her family seems to love her everybody makes mistakes so i hope that people wont judge her for just this one picture
3009919 we want to make sure that theyre not landing on some site that would make us blanch
3009920 when i let her know that i understood and heard what she was saying i think that was important to her
3009921 as a consequence of my books doing well suddenly its easier to get takeout whenever we feel like it its easier to get a housekeeper to come in one or two days to help do the laundry or help clean up its easier to do a lot of things that frankly the vast majority of american women cant afford but were not that far removed from the situation where this work was falling on her in a very heavy way
3009922 but what i know is that shell be at the center of the democratic party for a very long time

3009948 it was against a background poignant with memories of evil procedures that our constitution was drawn
3009949 as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged and it is in such twilight that we must be most aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness

3009953 although we always knew that the claims made were baseless and without merits i believe this dismissal order dispels any contingent liability that ofek was a subject to since the counterclaim was filed back in january 2005 it is also a personal vindication and serves to clear any possible improper actions it was alleged i carried out
3009954 we are excited about the addition of the new equipment with its ability to take the company a giant step forward from our present local methods of processing gold as a result we anticipate a significant increase in additional gold reserves and increased value to the shareholders
